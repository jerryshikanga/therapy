				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before the 2016 election, writer <a href="http://thenoker.com/" target="_blank">Michael Noker</a> was “incredibly close” with his mother. He saw her as a role model because of her strength, feminism and history of overcoming abuse. Before he came out as gay, his mother was already teaching him the importance of respecting members of the LGBT community.</p>
<p>Then he learned she was voting for Donald Trump. Because of Hillary Clinton’s persecution of her husband’s accusers during his sex scandal, his mother didn’t perceive Clinton as a more feminist choice than Trump. She was also disappointed with Obamacare and seemed to want a new leader who would change it.</p>
<p>When Noker told her about Trump’s comments on the infamous tape with Billy Bush, she dismissed them as “probably taken out of context.” He also informed her of the many sexual assault allegations Trump faced. She dismissed them as well, saying it was suspicious that women were coming forward so many years after the purported incidents.<span id="more-5236"></span></p>
<p>Although he understood some of her logic, the choice to vote for Trump flabbergasted Noker. Before the election, he expressed his frustration, sadness and confusion in a <a href="https://medium.com/@michaelnoker/my-feminist-mother-is-voting-for-trump-65f4c652d8c4#.r389ll15v" target="_blank">post</a> on Medium:</p>
<p>“The same woman who walked away from abusive relationships, who tearfully listened as I told her about my own experiences, who taught me the importance of respecting women, members of the LGBT community, and people of color, well before I ever came out to her, is now voting for Donald Trump, the personification of America’s last surviving angry white man.”</p>
<p>Noker was also worried about his mother’s tacit support of Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, who had passed anti-LGBT legislation during his time as the governor of Indiana. She didn’t seem to understand the full meaning of her vote for Trump.</p>
<p>Since the election ended, Noker and his mother have only spoken twice. One time was on her birthday.</p>
<p>When the day arrived, Noker was dreading the conversation.</p>
<p>“Part of me hopes she doesn’t answer so I can leave a voicemail,” he <a href="http://thenoker.com/compassion-political-fallout/" target="_blank">wrote</a> on his personal blog.</p>
<p>Then Noker developed a positive attitude by remembering one of the most important values his mother taught him: compassion. To begin repairing his relationship with the woman who helped him develop values he was proud of, he would need to exercise those values and look past her politics.</p>
<p>Despite her change in politics, Noker knew she was still the same woman who would support and protect him through anything.</p>

<p>“I’m going to call my mom because I know that as soon as anybody comes for me, she’ll be beside me with her 20-gauge,” Noker wrote.</p>
<p>He asked for compassion on both sides of the aisle and called out both conservatives and liberals for behavior that has further divided us and showed a lack of empathy.</p>
<p>“Conservatives are telling the rest of us to &#8216;get over it already&#8217; and laughing at others’ pain and fear. That’s not right,” he wrote. “Those of us who lost this election season are refusing to talk to friends and family who supported Trump. That’s not right either.”</p>
<p>Noker spoke with his mother a second time during Thanksgiving. It’s still too soon for his relationship with his mother to return to normal, he said, but he is at least taking steps to repair it.</p>
<p>Noker’s story shows we can take steps to eventually move past the anger and bitterness of the 2016 election. Right now it’s hard for some of us to remember what our familial relationships were like before the election. All we can see is another person who voted for the candidate we hated and stood against our values.</p>
<p>As the weeks march on, stories like Noker’s will most likely become more common. The more time goes by, the more opportunities we have to remember the entirety of who our family members are.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s going to happen. You’re praying it doesn’t, but it’s inevitable.</p>
<p>During Thanksgiving, one of your relatives is going to bring up post-election politics. If your family members have opposing political views, this could be the beginning of a terrible evening. Your annoying uncle might say Trump isn’t so bad, which spurs your equally annoying aunt into going on a rant about how your uncle hates women.</p>
<p>A few minutes later everyone is shouting and arguing about issues and people you are sick of hearing about: Trump, his cabinet, Hillary, her emails, the electoral college, Bernie Sanders, Obamacare, 2020 and much more. There’s a chance someone will rope you in and pressure you to take a stance in front of the whole family.</p>
<p>What do you do? How do you handle the situation and the stress?<span id="more-5141"></span></p>
<p>At Talkspace we work with more than 1,000 therapists who have guided clients through this situation. Some of them might be chatting with their clients about Thanksgiving as you are reading this post.</p>
<p>Here is some of their advice for making it through a Thanksgiving dinner that is likely to become more like a fourth presidential debate than a nice family reunion:</p>
<h2>Set Up Some Thanksgiving Rules Beforehand</h2>
<p>If you’re in a position where you can get everyone to agree not to talk about post-election politics during Thanksgiving, exercise that power. Here are some less divisive pop culture and political topics you can suggest:</p>
<ul>
<li>The non-political TV shows, movies and documentaries everyone has been talking about: Stranger Things, The Crown, Game of Thrones, Westworld, Magical Beasts, etc.</li>
<li>Celebrity gossip: What were the juiciest parts of the AMAs?</li>
<li>What happened to turduckens?</li>
<li>Which Thanksgiving dessert is best?</li>
</ul>
<h2>If They Talk About It Anyway, Change the Subject or Walk Away</h2>
<p>If it’s clear a political conversation is brewing at the table, you can try to change the subject. People will know what you’re doing, but that’s OK. Push forward!</p>
<p>During the portion of the evening where people are away from the table and talking in groups, it’s OK to walk away from political conversations. If you’re polite about it, your family should understand.</p>
<h2>Stuff Their Mouths Full of Food</h2>
<p>It will be hard for your cousin to shout #BoycottHamilton when her mouth is full of turkey. If you focus on getting your family to stuff their faces, they won’t have as much time to talk and spew divisive political opinions.</p>
<p>You can make a fun game out of it. The moment someone says something volatile, pass more food to them. If you can keep their mouths full through most of the evening, you win!</p>
<h2>If You Can’t Avoid the Politics, Be Civil</h2>
<p>No matter how much a family member’s political views upset you, there is no need for name calling, insults or threats. If you feel like you can’t back down from a political discussion, remember you can make your point without being hurtful.</p>
<p>“Try to listen to your family members without the intent to respond or rebuttal,” said Talkspace therapist <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/meet-our-therapists-alan-hunt/" target="_blank">Alan Hunt</a>. “Listen to them with the intent to let them feel heard and in attempt to better understand their perspectives.”</p>
<h2>Think Beyond Politics and Thanksgiving, Consider the Relationships</h2>
<p>When you care about someone, your relationship with them will go beyond politics. Political opinions are only a small part of who your family members are.</p>
<p>Before saying something you might regret, think about the familial relationship as a whole. Talkspace therapist <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/03/meet-our-therapists-jor-el-caraballo/https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/03/meet-our-therapists-jor-el-caraballo/" target="_blank">Jor-El Caraballo</a> recommended asking yourself this question: “What do I want this relationship to be like moving forward?”</p>
<p>Your actions during Thanksgiving have consequences beyond that day. Remember this when you are on the verge of letting your emotions get the best of you.</p>
<h2>Remember What Thanksgiving Is Actually About: Being Thankful</h2>
<p>None of us are thankful for the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/election-cycle-nightmare-stressing-infographic/" target="_blank">horrible election cycle</a> we endured, so why bring it up during Thanksgiving? Think about what you ARE thankful for.</p>
<p>There are mental health benefits to gratitude, so this will be much better for you than getting angry about politics. Gratitude can <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/11/the-thanksgiving-dichotomy-gratitude-vs-stress-infographic/" target="_blank">increase happiness and combat negative emotions</a>. Try it!</p>
