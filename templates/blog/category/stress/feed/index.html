				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you&#8217;re looking down the barrel of a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/college-students-guide-mental-health-wish-knew/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">school</a> midterm report or a major work project, finding inspiration should be easy. You&#8217;re on deadline, after all! But the urge to procrastinate strikes us all, and often at the worst times.</p>
<p>Procrastination takes many forms, and leans on avoidant traits that end up harming us in the long run.. Here are the main reasons we procrastinate — and how to stop.<span id="more-11431"></span></p>
<h2>1. The pursuit of perfection</h2>
<p>A project left undone still has potential for perfection. An unwritten report has no typos. An uncoded program, no bugs. In a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/the-imperfection-of-perfectionism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perfectionist</a> mindset, when you do work, you risk screwing something up. And that&#8217;s a scary thought to some. By procrastinating, we hold ourselves to an impossible standard — and as a result, never achieve anything noteworthy.</p>
<p>Science backs this theory up: A <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/khoffman/Psyc3010/Flett'92_PerfProcr.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">study from York University</a> indicated that students who scored highly in measures of perfectionism also had strong tendencies to procrastinate.</p>
<p>But how do you squash your perfectionist tendencies and get back to the grind? A therapist can help you work through the root causes of your perfectionism, like anxiety. Also, there are some exercises <a href="&quot;https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/4-signs-perfectionism-is-holding-you-back-and-how-to-break-free/“" target="”_blank”">you can do yourself</a>, like changing how you consider &#8220;success&#8221; and being kinder to yourself.</p>
<p>Once you learn to face the possibility of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/psychology-behind-success-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failure</a>, starting projects becomes much simpler.</p>
<h2>2. Low energy levels</h2>
<p>Sometimes we procrastinate because we can&#8217;t do anything else: The thought of opening our laptop, sitting down at our desk, and writing 10 pages (10 pages!?) seems impossible. There can be a number of causes for <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/6-helpful-tips-on-how-to-unleash-your-motivation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low energy</a>.</p>
<p>First, do a healthy-habits check. Are you eating junk food? Drinking too much? <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/sleeping-with-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sleeping</a> less than eight hours a day? Not exercising? Any one of these problems could be your procrastination culprit. But if you&#8217;re generally doing right by your body, it&#8217;s time to call in a pro.</p>
<p>A doctor can check your blood: you may have anemia, a hypoactive thyroid, or low B-12. They can also go over your medical history for any other diagnoses that may lead to low energy.</p>
<p>Depression can also cause low energy. A therapist can help make that assessment and get you the help you need.</p>
<h2>3. Inability to focus</h2>
<p>You want to work on your paper. You really do. But every time you open your computer, you find yourself browsing to Facebook or Reddit — and suddenly eight hours of mindless “sugar-filled” entertainment have passed, and you&#8217;ve written <i>maybe</i> ten words.</p>
<p>Improving your focus isn&#8217;t impossible. A number of techniques help you hone in on the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3050123/8-ways-to-improve-your-focus" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">task at hand</a>, like brief meditation beforehand, unplugging from technology, or listening to calming background music. But if <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/finding-inner-peace-mindfulness-5-senses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mindfulness</a> isn&#8217;t helping, consider checking in with your therapist. You might have ADHD.</p>
<p>While procrastination isn&#8217;t <a href="http://www.epanlab.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Niermann-Scheres-2014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">a direct symptom of ADHD</a>, research has shown that there are correlations between procrastinators and other symptoms. A mental health professional can determine if you have related behaviors that indicate an ADHD diagnosis — and are causing your procrastination, too.</p>
<h2>4. Believing a better you will do it later</h2>
<p>“Future you” will <i>totally</i> get this done. Future you will have endless opportunities to succeed. For instance, it&#8217;s supposed to rain on Saturday, so hiking won&#8217;t tempt you. And by the weekend, you&#8217;ll know for sure if you got the promotion you were angling for, so you&#8217;ll be in a much better <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/control-emotions-cognitive-behavioral-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mood</a>.</p>
<p>But we can&#8217;t hoist our problems onto our future selves. If we&#8217;re waiting for the perfect time and the ideal circumstances, we may not get <i>anything</i> done. Maybe the sun shines on Saturday — and maybe you get passed over for the job. Future you could be just as gloomy and sad as you are today, so why not just get started?</p>
<p>If the project looks too momentous for current you, break it into smaller pieces. Work for just ten minutes and then “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsABTmT1_M0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">treat yo self</a>” with something small. Repeat this process enough times and the project will be done — before future you has a chance to muck it up.</p>
<h2>5. The task is vague or uncertain</h2>
<p>Sometimes, we avoid doing a project because we don&#8217;t know what the project really entails. Perhaps the instructions are vague, or the scope is enormous — leaving you flailing about.</p>
<p>To sort out the task and fix this pesky problem, get out your pen and paper (or whatever brainstorming tool works best for you). Write down everything that needs to get done, starting with the tiniest aspects. For a long research paper, &#8220;go to the library&#8221; or &#8220;do a Google search&#8221; are acceptable step ones.</p>
<p>Find an easy, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/how-setting-micro-goals-can-increase-happiness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manageable</a> first task and go from there. Once you&#8217;ve completed that to-do, go back to your list. Have any new must-dos come up? Add them. Go down the list step by step until you&#8217;ve got the whole thing done. And if the procrastination monster rises again, feel free to go scorched-earth and repeat this process entirely. Getting lost in the woods of our to-do list is also an easy invitation for procrastination.</p>
<h2>Seek Help if Procrastination is Affecting You</h2>
<p>Procrastination is a frustrating desire. Of course we want to get the project done — it&#8217;s hanging over our head like <a href="https://www.history.com/news/what-was-the-sword-of-damocles" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Damocles&#8217; sword</a>. But sometimes we just <i>can&#8217;t do it</i>. Identifying the root cause of your hesitation is the key to get must-do work done.</p>
<p>A therapist or counselor can teach you methods to help work past whatever is holding you back from completing important tasks or projects. They also provide a safe level of accountability that can be followed up on weekly. Consider this type of help if procrastination is affecting your performance or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/what-is-happiness-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happiness</a> in critical areas like work or relationships.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve hit rock bottom before, you know how much it sucks&#8230;and you probably want to make sure you never get to that point again. Maybe you remember the warning signs you felt the last time, and now you’re sitting here thinking, “Oh crap, I feel a breakdown coming on!” Well, that’s your sign that you gotta protect yourself and prevent that nervous breakdown from actually happening.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s not so effective to just sit around and wish rock bottom away. When we feel ourselves declining, we have to be proactive and take steps to make positive changes and pick ourselves up — before the worst actually happens. Here are 6 ideas to get you moving in the right direction.</p>
<p><span id="more-11399"></span></p>
<h2>1. Ask For Help</h2>
<p>It’s hard to get through a crisis by yourself. If you feel like you’re headed for a bad place, don’t be afraid or ashamed to ask for help! You can talk to a trusted friend, family member, or a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/mental-health-counselor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health professional</a>. Ask for advice, vent to them, cry on their shoulder — whatever you need to do.</p>
<p>The person you open up to can also hold you accountable for positive changes you hope to make and inspire you to keep going. If you’re not in therapy, consider finding a therapist in person or <a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/online-therapy-with-a-licensed-therapist?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_POST_INLINE&amp;utr_adgroup=inline-link-cta&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/11/positive-change-before-rock-bottom&amp;var=promo-b&amp;partner=Talkspace%20Blog&amp;code=BLOG45">online</a>. If you’re already in therapy, be open about the fact that you’re struggling. Maybe you can be squeezed in for another session or a phone chat. And, while sometimes a rough patch is temporary and you can just ride it out, other times a bad spell can be longer lasting. If so, don’t be afraid to reach out to a therapist.</p>
<p>Remember: <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/how-to-ask-for-help-mental-health-care/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asking for help</a> is not a sign of weakness!</p>
<h2>2. Say “No” When You Need To</h2>
<p>When you’re nearing rock bottom, you have to put yourself first, and that means saying no to others. You might be used to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/09/assert-yourself-at-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">always saying “yes”</a> to people to please them, but sometimes when your mental health is at stake, you need to be a tiny bit selfish. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/working-hard-burning-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doing too much</a> and spreading yourself too thin might push you over the edge.</p>
<p>Saying “no” could mean cancelling plans with friends and explaining that you need to take a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/12-best-ways-spend-mental-health-day-according-therapist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health day</a>, or calling out of work for a day or two to regroup. Use this time to yourself to relax, take care of yourself, or get the extra help you need.</p>
<h2>3. Monitor Your Emotions</h2>
<p>Keep a journal or log of your moods and emotions. This can be in a notebook or on your phone — whichever you’re more likely to keep up with. Be introspective and aware of what you’re feeling. You know yourself better than anybody else does, and you can probably feel it when you’re heading downhill.</p>
<p>When you write down how you’re feeling and compare it to days or weeks prior in your log, you can get a better idea of where you stand in the moment: better than usual, staying steady on cruise control, or taking a wrong turn. With <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/5-therapist-approved-ways-de-stress-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journaling</a>, you’ll have a long term log that you can learn from, and possibly identify triggers and patterns along the way. It can be helpful to share this info with your therapist!</p>
<p>This way, you’re learning from the past and using this information to improve in the future.</p>
<h2>4. Indulge In Your Favorite Self-Care Methods</h2>
<p>When you feel rock bottom getting closer, it’s time to kick your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/self-care-stop-stress-secrets/">self-care</a> into overdrive. If you’re feeling like you don’t even know where to start, or feeling so hopeless that you don&#8217;t know what will make you feel better, you can make a list of three things you can do in the next three days that you know will help calm you down and make you feel at least a teeny bit better.</p>
<p>Some ideas could be: taking a yoga class, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/meditation-science-eases-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meditating</a>, treating yourself to a massage, taking a candlelit bath, or coloring in a coloring book. Listen to your mind and body — what kind of love and attention are they craving?</p>
<p>Think about the last time you felt mentally unwell. What did you do that helped? Use that as motivation to do it again.</p>
<h2>5. Focus On Your Overall Health</h2>
<p>Physical and mental health go hand in hand. When you feel your mental health declining, it’s a good idea to check in with yourself physically and see if there are any changes you can make to your daily life that can be beneficial. Are you getting enough sleep, or staying up all night? Are you eating regularly, or constantly skipping meals? Feeling physically well will help give you energy and power to fight through this rough patch.</p>
<p>You can also assess your caffeine intake, as too much <a href="https://www.webmd.com/balance/features/brewing-trouble#1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">caffeine can induce anxiety</a> — or worsen existing anxiety. On top of maintaining these basic areas of your life, avoid inherently unhealthy behaviors like illegal drug use or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/when-weekend-drinking-turns-into-a-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excessive drinking</a>. Drugs and alcohol might seem like a nice, quick fix to forget about the problem you’re dealing with, but in reality, they can cause you to spiral out, and even cause further problems down the road.</p>
<h2>6. Cut Toxic People Out Of Your Life</h2>
<p>You might be dealing with some “<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/set-boundaries-energy-vampires/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">energy vampires”</a> who are making you feel even worse. These toxic people can make it easier for you to end up on the fast track to rock bottom. They can drain the energy that you need to keep up the positive lifestyle changes you’re making, and they can also influence you to make poor decisions.</p>
<p>When you’re in a negative place mentally, you need to focus your energy on yourself and your wellbeing, not whatever the energy vampire is trying to get you to focus on. You might need to cut some people out of your life, or at least take a break from the toxic person, distancing yourself and requesting space while you aren’t at your best.</p>
<h2>Stay Away from the Bottom by Looking Up</h2>
<p>Follow these tips and you’ll be on track to making positive changes in your life that’ll stop you from reaching your lowest point.</p>
<p>Everyone has moments of weakness and crisis, and everyone has their own ways to cope and return to their mental health baseline. Plus, you can always remember this: It’s always okay to ask for help and there’s only one way to go from rock bottom and that’s up.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To be stressed is to be alive. And however uncomfortable it makes you, it is a universal feeling that is a part of the imperfect human experience. Stress saps your energy, causes fatigue, and increases negative thoughts that <a href="https://www.amherst.edu/campuslife/health-safety-wellness/counseling/wellness/self-care-and-stress-reduction/de-stress" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">can</a> contribute to anxious feelings. Fortunately, there are ways to build up a healthy response to stress that can even reverse the uncomfortable feelings over time.</p>
<p>The most basic and important way to mitigate stress is by taking care of yourself. It may sound simple, but your mind and body are connected in powerful ways and by maintaining your physical, emotional, and mental reserves, you can actually prevent and manage stress.</p>
<p><span id="more-10481"></span></p>
<h2>6 Tips to Mitigate Stress with Self-care</h2>
<p>To live a happier life, and lower your risk of developing health issues, here are some tips for nurturing your physical and mental health before stress runs you ragged.</p>
<h3>1. Consider doing less</h3>
<p>Sometimes your body needs down time to relax and replenish your energy stores. Rather than taking on more responsibilities or saying “yes” to that invitation to hang out with friends, take a pause and ask yourself: Are the benefits of accepting this invitation worth the potential <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/can-you-be-addicted-to-stress/" target="_blank">stress</a>?</p>
<p>Sometimes the answer will be no, a cue to have a more relaxing night in.</p>
<h3>2. Make time for reflection</h3>
<p>Whether you write down stressful thoughts to get them out of your head, or keep a regular diary that focuses on <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/4-mental-health-benefits-of-gratitude-to-keep-in-mind-this-thanksgiving/" target="_blank">gratitude</a> and positivity, taking time to reflect on your feelings and write them down can have a calming effect. Taking a few minutes each day for this exercise can even help prevent future feelings of stress.</p>
<h3>3. Take a vacation</h3>
<p>No time ever seems perfect to pack your bags and book a trip, and yet it is incredibly important to slow down and take time for yourself away from your typical settings.</p>
<p>If paid time off isn’t possible in your line of work, try milking those long holiday weekends by <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/take-mental-health-vacation-7-ways/" target="_blank">going someplace new locally</a>. This will help you come back replenished, restored and ready for those busy moments.</p>
<h3>4. Commit to regular exercise</h3>
<p>Making time for regular sweat sessions helps your body reduce the mental and physical impact of stress.</p>
<p>If frustration is building, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/5-ways-exercise-is-great-for-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">take a high-energy exercise class</a> to help you sweat out pent up emotions, which can have a calming effect. Yoga is also another common way to cope with stress through physical movement and stretching.</p>
<h3>5. Soak up the sun</h3>
<p>Nature has healing properties and getting outside <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/112/28/8567.abstract" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">can help</a> ease a bad mood or calm anxious feelings. Whether you take a long walk in the trees, a leisurely beach stroll, or spend time on a scenic park bench, spending time in the sun can help foster a feeling of peace.</p>
<h3>6. Practice meditation</h3>
<p>To help stimulate your relaxation response, try intentional breathing and a basic <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/meditation-science-eases-anxiety/" target="_blank">meditation practice</a>. There are mobile apps and breathing exercises that can help you strategically calm your body and mind, helping reduce mental stress.</p>
<h2>Enjoy an Enhanced, Low-Stress Life</h2>
<p>Practicing self-care is an important way to reduce your stress and anxiety levels. In doing so, you will experience an enhanced immune system, higher energy levels, and an improved well-being.</p>
<p>Activating a relaxation response can reduce, and even reverse, the physical, mental and emotional effects of stress – and it only takes a few short minutes each day to garner the positive benefits.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stress has been a part of the human experience since the dawn of consciousness. It’s an instinctual reaction to perceived threats, originating as humans made their way up the food chain. Gone though are the saber-toothed tigers and growling bellies of our ancient past. Our new threats are red bubbles with numbers in them, and politically-charged talk radio over hour-long commutes.</p>
<p>Prolonged stress takes its toll. <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2014/stress-report.pdf" target="_blank">Over 70 percent of Americans report experiencing physical and psychological symptoms caused by their stress</a>. Productivity loss and health care related to stress costs employers close to $300 billion annually, according to the same American Psychological Association study. Stress has reached epidemic proportions, and how to cope with, or manage modern stress has become a literal “billion dollar question”.</p>
<p><strong>In honor of “Stress Awareness Month”, Talkspace asked our therapist community and co-workers to share their favorite ways to de-stress</strong>.* We hope you discover some beneficial new stress management solutions!</p>
<p><span id="more-9600"></span></p>
<h2>Set the Mood</h2>
<p>“I&#8217;m obsessed with essential oils. If I feel too stressed out or anxious during the day, I put a few drops of peppermint essential oil on my wrists and behind my ears. It makes me much calmer and helps me concentrate. Also, as soon as I get home from work, I put a mix of lavender, bergamot, and frankincense essential oils in a diffuser and let it on all night. It&#8217;s very soothing and helps me relax completely, even after an intense day&#8217;s work.”<br />
<em>&#8211; Paula, Marketing</em></p>
<p>“I light some candles, <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/2017/01/138228/palo-santo-uses-holy-wood-spirituality" target="_blank">burn Palo Santo</a>, put on some music, and free write until I feel the stress lift. Or I sweat it out at the gym or yoga studio. If I&#8217;m really in it, I call for backup and reach out to a friend.”<br />
<em>&#8211; JoAnna, Marketing</em></p>
<p>“Epsom salt bath with a few drops of essential oils, light a candle or two, whilst listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WcWHZc8s2I" target="_blank">Sade</a>.”<br />
<em>&#8211; Nadia, People &amp; Operations</em></p>
<h2>Chill with Media</h2>
<p>“Going down a rabbit hole of old <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=whose+line+is+it+anyway" target="_blank">Whose Line is it Anyway clips on YouTube</a>.”<br />
<em>&#8211; Gordon, Marketing</em></p>
<p>“I listen to Harry Potter audio books! It gives me an escape and makes me happy.”<br />
<em>&#8211; Christine, LPC &#8211; Talkspace Therapist</em></p>
<p>“Listening to electronic dance music or going to a music festival!”<br />
<em>&#8211; Billie Jean, Engineering</em></p>
<p>“Watching bad reality TV or doing a crossword from start to finish.”<br />
<em>&#8211; Fleur, Marketing</em></p>
<p>“Karaoke private-room singing with family and/or friends; dancing.”<br />
<em>&#8211; Kiki, G&amp;A team</em></p>
<h2>Surround Yourself With Friends and Family</h2>
<p>“My boyfriend and I drive around and explore new areas around us we didn’t know about.”<br />
<em>&#8211; Kimberly, Talkspace Therapist</em></p>
<p>“Spending time with my son helps me de-stress — being able to experience the world through his eyes reminds me of the wonder and joy that surrounds us.”<br />
<em>&#8211; Jill, LCSW &#8211; Talkspace Therapist</em></p>
<p>“My favorite ways to de-stress including going for a walk with my two dogs and daughter, and coloring!”<br />
<em>&#8211; Holli, LMHC &#8211; Talkspace Therapist</em></p>
<h2>Bedtime Rituals</h2>
<p>“I take 10 minutes to stretch at night before bed. It gets me out of my head and into my body. I also try as much as I can to sleep with my phone outside of my room, so that I don&#8217;t mindlessly scroll on social media right before I close my eyes and as soon as I open them. I notice that my phone brings me more stress than anything in the world!”<br />
<em>&#8211; Charlotte, Marketing</em></p>
<p>“I sleep with my phone in another room.”<br />
<em>&#8211; Sean, Engineering</em></p>
<p>“My favorite way to de-stress is to work out, take a long shower, and then sit in my robe with a sheet mask on!”<br />
<em>&#8211; Katie, Network</em></p>
<h2>Spend Time in Nature</h2>
<p>“Horses! My de-stress is heading to the barn, rain or shine, pumping up the country music and riding, grooming and loving on my horses! I will often work from a picnic blanket in the pasture while my horses run around and graze. There is no better way to de-stress!”<br />
<em>&#8211; Amanda, Director of Therapist Community and Enrichment</em></p>
<p>“Walking to the beach in the sunshine or a fun dinner with people I love!”<br />
<em>&#8211; Shannon, LMFT &#8211; Talkspace Therapist</em></p>
<h2>Indulge in Your Favorite Things</h2>
<p>“I like to make really big detailed illustrations that I can chip away at every night.”<br />
<em>&#8211; Anna, Marketing</em></p>
<p>“I binge eat Asian food until I sweat the stress out. Also, I meditate daily. Sometimes I combine the two.”<br />
<em>&#8211; Josh, Marketing</em></p>
<p>“I usually create a safe space within my house. I prepare snacks, grab a glass of wine, and play my favorite music. Snacks are a combination of healthy and comfort food and music is eclectic, going from English to French tunes that de-stress me. That takes me to distant lands, within my own home, through creative visualization.”<br />
<em>&#8211; Cynthia, LCSW-S &#8211; Talkspace Therapist</em></p>
<h2>Is Stress Getting to You?</h2>
<p>Stress takes many forms, and not all stress is negative. There are healthy stressors, coined “eustress” by Dr. Hans Seyle. Eustress coincides with positive life experiences, such as the birth of a child, getting married, or competing in intramural sports.</p>
<p>When stress becomes too great, and manifests itself through physical pain or emotional outbursts, this is considered “distress”. To minimize the damage of distress, it’s important to seek options that help you cope with feeling overwhelmed. If your stress has become a heavy burden, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/" target="_blank">online therapy</a> may be a positive next step for you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feeling stressed out lately? If so, we’re not surprised.</p>
<p>According to a 2015 American Psychological Association study, <a href="http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2015/snapshot.aspx" target="_blank">24 percent of Americans experience extreme stress on a regular basis</a>. A similar study in 2017 found that <a href="http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2017/state-nation.pdf" target="_blank">63 percent of the U.S. worries about the future of the country, 62 percent about money, and 61 percent about work</a>, and stress levels have been steadily increasing over the last decade.</p>
<p><span id="more-9586"></span></p>
<p>Though stress isn’t always bad, more often than not, high stress levels wreak havoc on our well-being. And while most of us continually try to reduce our stress levels, sometimes it’s hard to walk back our workaholic, pressure-seeking nature. So hard in fact, stress may seem like an addiction. But is that possible, stress addiction?</p>
<p>Though it may not be designated as an official diagnosis, it’s clear to most experts that indeed, you can be addicted to stress.</p>
<h2>What Is Stress?</h2>
<p>In short, stress is part of our evolutionary fight-or-flight response that Hungarian endocrinologist <a href="https://www.stress.org/what-is-stress/" target="_blank">Hans Selye</a> defined as “the body’s nonspecific response to any demand, whether it is caused by or results in pleasant or unpleasant stimuli.”</p>
<p>Biologically, once the stress response is activated, our body pumps hormones such as “stress hormone” cortisol, adrenaline, and dopamine into our system to, as <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/19/stress-addiction_n_5689123.html" target="_blank">Rachel Nuwer</a> writes in the Huffington Post, “summon our strength and turn off nonessential functions to funnel resources to muscles and the brain.” Central nervous system activity, including body temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate increase so we’re poised to take on the challenge at hand with hyper-focused attention.</p>
<p>When stress is caused by a negative event — anything from <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/cope-mental-health-natural-disasters/" target="_blank">natural disasters</a>, war zones, and abuse to financial trouble, health issues, excessive workloads, relationship difficulty, and many other situations — stress temporarily pumps activating hormones into our body to get through a tough spot. Once the threat has passed, the body returns to its normal functioning cadence.</p>
<p>At lower levels or in short bursts, stress is both normal and important for living a fulfilling life. For example, we may feel stress before a first date, during a job interview, or giving a musical performance. It can also push us to make changes in our lives and grow as people. Selye coined these types of positive pressures as “eustress,” adding that stress is “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/22/obituaries/dr-hans-selye-dies-in-montreal-studied-effects-of-stress-on-body.html" target="_blank">the spice of life</a>.”</p>
<h2>Stress and Addiction</h2>
<p>Where we get into trouble is when the stress response becomes so habitual we seek more and more stress, such as overworking, and we become addicted to that heightened state. Because stress isn’t just a mental reaction but a physiological one, the “high” that stress causes can become addictive for some people.</p>
<p>“[Stress causes a] natural high,” Concordia University neuroscientist and addiction specialist Jim Pfaus explained to <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2012/09/06/can-we-become-addicted-to-stress/" target="_blank">The Greatist</a>. “By activating our arousal and attention systems, stressors can also wake up the neural circuitry underlying wanting and craving — just like drugs do.”</p>
<p>Once we become accustomed to a higher degree of stress, it may seem necessary to feel that way all the time. The brain will seek out more of the “feel good” chemicals in order to maintain the same stress level, which, just like addiction, requires even higher amounts of stress over time.</p>
<p>“After time, the brain develops a tolerance for stress, meaning you’ll need more of it to feel the same rush,” writes Lisa Evans for <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3025717/do-you-have-a-neurochemical-dependence-on-stress" target="_blank">Fast Company</a>. “You may take on more projects than you can actually handle or wait until the ultimate [last] minute to get something done because the adrenal system which fuels stress hormones is fatiguing, forcing you to work harder to get that same burst of cortisol and adrenaline that are released when the body is under pressure.”</p>
<p>While we all know people who have high amounts of stress in their life, experts such as psychologist and addiction researcher Stanton Peele warned in The Greatist to not use the term “stress addiction” indiscriminately. It only applies when stress has a serious adverse effect on someone’s life.</p>
<p>“Only when that pursuit of stress has a significant negative impact on your life could it qualify as addiction,” Peele said, while pointing out that some people thrive in high pressure situations, such as Olympic athletes. It takes more than just high stress levels to define an addiction.</p>
<h2>How To Tell If You’re Addicted To Stress</h2>
<p>How do you know if what you’re feeling crosses that line into addiction? Prolonged levels of high stress take a toll on both physical and mental health. If you’re experiencing any of the negative health consequences, that may be the first clue. According to U.S. statistics, <a href="https://www.stress.org/daily-life/" target="_blank">77 percent of people report physical problems caused by stress, while 73 percent report psychological effects</a>.</p>
<p>Look for <a href="https://www.stress.org/stress-effects/" target="_blank">symptoms </a>such as: fatigue, increased heart rate, high blood pressure, insomnia, a change in appetite, anxiety, irritability, depression, withdrawal, and a compromised immune system. Those with high levels of stress are also more prone to other addictions, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/addiction-mental-illness/" target="_blank">such as drug or alcohol abuse</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, blogger and former stress addict <a href="https://www.dianemunoz.com/blog/how-to-tell-if-youre-addicted-to-stress" target="_blank">Diane Munoz</a> recommends we look out for frequent complaints, as stress addicts tend to spend a lot of time focusing on just how busy and stressful their lives are. Stress addicts may also find they have no free time and ditch social interactions and fun hobbies in favor of seeking out stressful scenarios while relationships fall by the wayside. They don’t feel happy, but the answer always seems to be piling on more stress.</p>
<h2>What You Can Do</h2>
<p>If you’re struggling with a suspected stress addiction, it’s important to reverse the trend. Not only would a visit to the doctor to address any physical ailments be a good place to start, but some experts also suggest a stress addiction, like other addictions, indicates underlying causes that are usually best addressed by a mental health professional.</p>
<p>“A stress addict is looking to feel numb through distraction to avoid dealing with the source of unhappiness and loss of control,” says <a href="http://www.turnonyourinnerlight.com/StressAddiction.html" target="_blank">Debbie Mandel</a>, author of <i>Addicted To Stress</i>, in a blog post. “It is easier to be incredibly busy than to face the painful layers of grief accumulated during the course of a lifetime.”</p>
<p>Addressing the more serious mental health and physical symptoms of stress may take time, but there are small ways you can start managing stress on a daily basis. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/03/how-you-can-beat-anxiety-with-mindful-breathing/" target="_blank">Techniques like meditation</a>, breathing exercises, journaling, working out, and guided imagery have all been shown to reduce stress levels.</p>
<p>It’s easier said than done, but stress doesn’t have to control your life. By taking the time to work through a stress addiction and learning to live in the present moment, we can improve our well-being and create a meaningful life. As John De Paola said, “Slow down and everything you are chasing will come around and catch you.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life is stressful. Work can be demanding, family life can be taxing, and so can our relationships, finances, and health-related struggles. Just turn on the news or open social media and your blood pressure is apt to rise. Really, there are so many things that can be triggers for stress, and we all experience our fair share of them on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Equally stressful is when we watch our partners suffer from heightened periods of stress. It can be upsetting to witness and can even create tension within our relationships. Perhaps the most difficult part is that we desperately want to help, but often feel bewildered about what the best approach might be.</p>
<p><span id="more-9582"></span></p>
<p>There is no one-size-fits all method for what to do when your partner is stressed, but I caught up with a few Talkspace therapists who offer some practical, compassionate, no-nonsense tips for how to help.</p>
<h2>1. Listen without judgement and validate their feelings.</h2>
<p>When we are stressed, we are often not even seeking advice, rather the need for our feelings to be heard.</p>
<p>“Validate their concerns and listen without problem solving,” offers Dr. Rachel O’Neill Ph.D., a Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor from Ohio. “Although it can be tempting to launch into ‘fix it mode,’ sometimes individuals just want a place to vent their stress.”</p>
<p>Besides being a good listener, it’s important that we not dictate the correct way for our partners to respond to stress, but rather recognize that we are all different.</p>
<p>“Don’t try to fix things for them or control how they respond to the stress,” explains Christine Tolman, a Licensed Professional Counselor from Idaho. “Allow them to feel safe with you; be a port in the storm.”</p>
<h2>2. Do a few small things each day to make your partner’s life easier.</h2>
<p>There are many ways to express concern or care for your partner. However, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/guide-setting-healthy-boundaries-relationships/" target="_blank">sometimes your partner may not want to directly discuss what is troubling them</a>. But that doesn’t mean you can’t do little things to show that you are aware of their feelings, and that you want to help lessen the stress.</p>
<p>“Expressing care and concern in a variety of ways can have a powerful impact,” says Jill E. Daino, a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) from New York. “A favorite meal or activity at the end of a hard day can help someone feel cared for,” she suggests.</p>
<h2>3. Learn to identify the signs of stress.</h2>
<p>Again, because not all people will directly share that they are stressed, it can be important for you to recognize the signs of stress in your partner. Many times, this will be signaled by a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/07/why-do-highly-sensitive-people-engage-in-routines/" target="_blank">change in habits</a> — something that you will be good at detecting because you know your partner so intimately.</p>
<p>“Changes in eating or sleeping habits, recurrent headaches or stomach aches, inability to concentrate or complete tasks are some of the issues we start hearing about when stress is present,” explains Cynthia Catchings, an LCSW from Virginia. “If you recognize these signs in your partner, be aware that stress may be the cause.”</p>
<h2>4. Recognize that men and women may experience stress differently.</h2>
<p>The differences in how men and women handle stress are generalized, of course, but it’s important to recognize that these differences might be a factor for you or your spouse — and also why you may feel confused about the best way to help.</p>
<p>“Men and women react differently to stress due to stress hormones,” explains Cynthia Catchings. “Women pay more attention to feelings and emotions, while a man is more interested in actions. Hence, a woman would generally prefer to receive comfort and love in the form of emotional support and holding, whereas a man is often more open to receive assistance with activities or other physical outlets.&#8221;</p>
<h2>5. Make self-care a priority for yourself so you can be strong for your partner.</h2>
<p>You can’t pour from an empty cup, so if your partner’s stress is causing you stress, it’s important to make self-care a top priority.</p>
<p>“Self-care is important, as we need to take care of ourselves to be strong enough for others when they need us,” says Cynthia Catchings.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/7-self-care-tips-for-when-stress-affects-your-body/" target="_blank">Self-care can take the form of exercise, meditation, or therapy</a>. It’s important to have at least one person outside your relationship (a friend, a therapist, etc.) to “vent” to about what is happening with your partner. You will not only be tending to your own needs, but you will be less likely to add additional stress to your partner’s already increased stress levels.</p>
<h2>6. If stress levels become unmanageable, help your partner seek outside help.</h2>
<p>Neither you or your partner can do this alone. If your partner’s stress level is making it difficult to function or causing high levels of anxiety or depression, it’s time to seek therapy.</p>
<p>How can you tell if your partner’s stress has reached that level? Well, sometimes increased stress levels are short-lived, but other times they can have severe impacts on a person’s life or relationships.</p>
<p>“Stress levels can become unmanageable and have severe impacts within the relationship,” says Jill E. Daino. “At that point it is important to be able to support your partner in taking care of him/herself and getting outside help if needed,” she explains.</p>
<p>The bottom line? It’s important to remember that all of us react differently to stress, but offering non-judgmental empathy and care is always the ticket when your partner is tense or overwhelmed.</p>
<p>However, it’s equally important to remember that you can’t always be the one to “save” your partner. If things are spiraling out of control, one of the most generous things you can do is to help your partner recognize this, and come up with a compassionate and effective plan to tackle the stress and feel better.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While it’s likely that the concept of masturbation was a source of stress when you were younger (because when you’re 11 it’s easy to believe masturbation can, indeed make you go blind), solo sex is great for your health. In fact, the mental health benefits of masturbation are so bountiful that I’d go so far as to claim masturbation is <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/7-self-care-tips-for-when-stress-affects-your-body/" target="_blank">self-care</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re not already masturbating regularly, you might want to add it into your routine (Ugh! What a horrible chore!) Aside from making you feel great, masturbation is great tool for de-stressing. Not convinced yet? Here are some ways masturbation helps you calm down.</p>
<p><span id="more-9578"></span></p>
<h2>Feel-good hormones are released</h2>
<p>Masturbation causes <a href="http://www.besthealthmag.ca/best-you/girlfriends-guide/6-healthy-reasons-to-masturbate/" target="_blank">dopamine</a>, a chemical associated with pleasure, to be released into your body. Simply put, dopamine makes you feel good and puts you in a better mood. On top of that, the hormone oxytocin, which is released during <a href="https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/2015/05/05/masturbation-as-medicine" target="_blank">orgasm, lowers cortisol levels</a>. Cortisol is a main stress hormone, and is usually present in high levels in stressed out people. Touching yourself and climaxing can boost these chemicals and, in result, help you feel more at peace.</p>
<h2>You can learn to love yourself</h2>
<p>Your <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/why-an-how-to-raise-your-self-esteem-for-stress-relief-3144820" target="_blank">self-esteem and body image are linked to your overall well-being</a> including your stress levels. Having poor self-esteem may make it harder for you to deal with everyday stressors. Not to mention, being self-deprecating takes a lot of energy. Being kind to yourself can take some stress off your plate. One way to practice self love is, well, making love to yourself! Get to know your body and appreciate how it works. Regular <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sex-and-relationships/masturbation" target="_blank">masturbation can help improve your body image</a> and self-esteem. Yep, that simple!</p>
<h2>You’ll sleep better</h2>
<p>I’ll never forget one of my previous roommates who said lovingly of her Hitachi magic wand, “That thing has put me to sleep many a night!” We all know <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/sleep-deprivation-hurts-mental-health/" target="_blank">sleep deprivation is no good for stress</a>, so before you turn to sleeping pills, why not turn to masturbation — with or without the help of a magic wand? An orgasm can act like a sedative to help you wind down after a long, stressful day and tire you out for bed, because <a href="https://www.rodalewellness.com/health/how-the-big-o-impacts-your-sleep" target="_blank">climaxing releases hormones like prolactin and oxytocin</a>, which get you nice and sleepy. Bonus: getting a good night’s sleep <a href="https://sleep.org/articles/does-sex-affect-sleep/" target="_blank">boosts your libido</a>. Win, win.</p>
<h2>Relieve physical pain, reduce stress</h2>
<p>Physical pain can really be a nuisance and add onto your stress levels. Masturbation resulting in orgasm can release chemicals called endorphins, which have pain killing properties. They <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=55001" target="_blank">interact with the opiate receptors in your brain</a> to alter your perception of pain. These are the same chemicals that are released after a long exercise session or… eating some dark chocolate. Get your mind off your pain by indulging in a solo sex session and you might find yourself free of pain, and in a zen state of mind.</p>
<h2>No risks, no worries. Reap the benefits of sex without the risks.</h2>
<p>For many people, sex can be more anxiety inducing than it is pleasurable. Sexual intercourse and oral sex come along with a slew of risks like unwanted pregnancy or STDs. You can avoid these dangers all together by having sex with yourself. Masturbation comes with a whopping <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sex-and-relationships/masturbation" target="_blank">0% chance of contracting STDs or getting pregnant</a>! Those who find themselves unable to relax during sex with a partner, because of the possible risks, can let themselves go solo. The safest sex you can have is solo sex!</p>
<p>Go on and flick your bean, spank your monkey, whatever you want to call it! I promise it won’t make you lose your vision (or experience any other bizarre side effect), and you might just <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/5-therapist-approved-ways-de-stress-day/" target="_blank">find yourself feeling a lot less stressed out</a>. Masturbation may be just what the doctor ordered.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stress is a natural part of everyday life. We’ve all experienced sweaty palms, a racing heartbeat, and a boost of adrenaline in a stressful situation. This<a href="http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/stress.aspx" target="_blank"> primal instinct</a> to protect ourselves from threats or danger originated long ago with our ancestors, and it continues today.</p>
<p>Obvious stressors present themselves at key turning points in life — a death in the family, or a significant life change like a move or new baby. But there are also stressors that can live under the radar, undetectable by our conscious mind. Having gone unnoticed, these stressors can initiate an extended “fight or flight” response that can have serious consequences for your health.</p>
<p><span id="more-9571"></span></p>
<p>According to the<a href="http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/stress.aspx" target="_blank"> American Psychological Association</a>, the longer stress lasts, the worse it is for both your mind and body. Chronic stress can impact your physical and psychological well-being by causing anxiety, high blood pressure, a weakened immune system, and other detrimental symptoms. Over time, these symptoms can lead to heart disease, depression, and obesity.</p>
<p>Here are five examples of secret stressors that could be wreaking havoc on your physical, mental, and emotional health while you’re unaware:</p>
<h2>Lack of Work-life Balance</h2>
<p>Many professionals spend more time at the office than they do at home, making it easy to tilt the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/working-hard-burning-out/" target="_blank">tenuous work-life balance</a> in favor of work. As employees move up the corporate ladder and take on more responsibilities, the stress from increased expectations grows in terms of time commitment both in and out of regular business hours. Plus, if your home life includes a partner and children or multiple volunteer commitments and hobbies, stress levels can gradually increase simply because you have so little time in the day to accomplish your to-do’s.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/work-life-balance/art-20048134" target="_blank"> Mayo Clinic</a> warns of the implications of a poor work-life balance: fatigue, burnout, poor physical health, an increased risk of substance abuse, and lost time with friends and loved ones. Not sure if you’ve put too much stock in work? Check out<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40479850/3-questions-to-ask-as-soon-as-your-work-life-balance-starts-slipping" target="_blank"> these three questions</a> to help gauge if your priorities need to be realigned to reduce underlying stress levels.</p>
<h2>Obsession With Smart Devices</h2>
<p>Our connected world comes with an endless barrage of notifications, emails, and texts that can lead to a state of ongoing stress. Many of us have accepted this as the new norm.<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201609/is-why-we-cant-put-down-our-phones" target="_blank"> Research</a> shows that our phones become like our childhood teddy bears, carrying significant emotional attachment.</p>
<p><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/excessive-cellphone-anxiety-experts-warn/story?id=48842476" target="_blank">Dr. Nancy Cheever</a>, who studied the relationship between cellphone use and anxiety, said that the more people use their phone, “the more anxious they are about using their phone.” The phones keep us in an endless state of anxiety where the only relief is to look at our phones more.</p>
<p>It’s an ongoing stress-inducing cycle, considering that on average, Americans check their phones<a href="https://nypost.com/2017/11/08/americans-check-their-phones-80-times-a-day-study/" target="_blank"> 80 times per day</a>. To fight back against this innate urge, set aside specific time intervals to respond to messages or scan your Facebook newsfeed. If needed, set a timer to avoid an unnecessary Pinterest or Instagram binge that keeps you scrolling for hours.</p>
<h2>Stressful Home Environment</h2>
<p>A basic question at any routine doctor appointment is: <i>Do you feel safe at home?</i></p>
<p>While this inquiry aims to uncover abuse or other serious issues, it points to a larger notion that how we feel and act in our home environments matter. With the increase in dual income households, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/raised-by-anxious-parents-heres-how-it-might-be-affecting-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">stress for both parents and children represents a real concern</a>, as everyone juggles a jam-packed schedule and a finite amount of time to spend together. An increase in households split by divorce and blended families reveals another layer of stress that can alter a peaceful home life, as each individual navigates newly complex familial relationships.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statistics" target="_blank">anxiety disorders representing the most common mental illness in the U.S.</a>, there’s a high probability that one or more family members struggle with some level of anxiety. The Anxiety and Depression Association of America also reports that 40 million adults in the U.S. are affected, yet only about 37% receive treatment. Additionally, Major Depressive Disorder affects more than 16.1 million American adults, which can lead to ongoing stress among family members, especially if left untreated.</p>
<h2>Few Quality Relationships</h2>
<p>Strong personal relationships can lift our spirits, offer support during difficult seasons, and help mitigate stress that arises in everyday life. Dr. Robert Waldinger, a clinical professor of psychiatry for Harvard Medical School, discovered in his 75-year study that <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/" target="_blank">relationships are a powerful influencer on life satisfaction</a>. His research shows that quality of life, health and happiness are directly linked to strong relationships.</p>
<p>With screen time dominating human interactions and our increasingly crowded calendars, relationships can take a back-seat. By not prioritizing interpersonal relationships, we can feel alone and unsupported —- the recipe for an unfulfilling and stressful life.</p>
<p>Combat this underlying stress by investing in quality time with your partner, family, friends, and with yourself. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/quick-guide-social-media-smartphone-addiction-infographic/" target="_blank">Commit to stowing away smart devices</a> and asking higher level questions to support greater intimacy.</p>
<p>Here’s<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/open-gently/201310/36-questions-bring-you-closer-together" target="_blank"> a list</a> of fun questions to weave in.</p>
<h2>Personal insecurities</h2>
<p>Confidence is essential for facing daily trials, helping to ward off negative vibes while feeling at peace with yourself and others. When we don’t feel confident about ourselves or our abilities, self-esteem suffers greatly. Research suggests that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2996275/" target="_blank">people with low self-esteem may lack the right coping skills to address day-to-day stressors</a>, and in the case of individuals suffering from chronic disease, self-esteem is directly correlated to stress levels.</p>
<p>The connection between personal insecurities and stress plays out in the world of social media. As social media users compare their looks and experiences to algorithmically curated images on Facebook and Instagram, this social comparison and self-objectification can lead to poorer mental health, lower self-esteem, and greater body shame, according to<a href="https://blog.allpsych.com/the-dangers-of-comparing-yourself-to-others-on-social-media/" target="_blank"> several studies</a>. Instead of becoming absorbed in virtual worlds where we only show our best selves, look for real-life experiences that boost your confidence and improve your view of the world. Take a class, volunteer, or set aside time for self-care. Your stress levels — and self-worth — will benefit.</p>
<p>Bringing these secret stressors out of the shadows is the first step to facing them head-on, supporting a happier, healthier you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since I was a boy, my body has been extremely sensitive and reactive to both physical and emotional stress. When my parents announced we were moving away from my hometown, my muscles tensed up so much I could barely use the bathroom for many days. Eventually I learned these health issues were a combination of a rare muscle tension condition and psychosomatic symptoms from my depressive-anxiety disorder.</p>
<p>Because my body usually felt like a car that had driven hundreds of thousands of miles — parts constantly requiring maintenance, always creaking, sputtering, or breaking down — I became a master of self-care. I spent hours every week making a conscious effort to heal and recuperate. This lifestyle was the only way for me to survive and function well enough to graduate from college and find employment. Whenever I neglected proper rest or pushed myself too far, new symptoms arose.<span id="more-8330"></span></p>
<p>Self-care, however, is important for everyone. Your mind and body are connected in ways you might not be aware of. Stress is the signal that it is time to physically and emotionally tend to yourself. By heeding the call, you can live a happier life and lower your risk of developing health issues.</p>
<p>From someone who was forced to become an expert on self-care, here are some tips for nurturing your physical and mental health before stress takes its toll:</p>
<h2>1. Make Time to Cry</h2>
<p>After I started working with a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a> and finally treating <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/what-is-crippling-depression/" target="_blank">my depression</a>, I cried almost every night for about a year. Each time my body thanked me. My muscles relaxed and I was able to sleep a little better. The stress I had held in for so long dissipated with each tear. My mind felt increasingly clear.</p>
<p>Sadness and pain are not the only emotions we can cope with by crying. We also need to literally drain the stress from our bodies. According to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4035568/" target="_blank">several studies</a>, crying can relieve stress, among many <a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/cry-it-out-6-surprising-health-benefits-shedding-few-tears-333952" target="_blank">other health benefits</a>.</p>
<p>Try to look past the stigma around tearing up, especially if you are a man. There is already enough pressure for us to hold in emotions.</p>
<p>“Crying is normal and nothing to be ashamed of,” therapist Sharon Martin told Medical Daily during an interview on the stigma surrounding shedding tears.</p>
<p>If you need to, find a place to be alone and watch or read something moving. When I was training my body to unleash the ocean of tears I had kept behind a dam for so long, I made a list of clips that had helped me let it all out. My favorites were the famous “It’s not your fault” scene from “Good Will Hunting” and a section of “Cannery Row” by John Steinbeck (the part where Doc beats Mac half to death for destroying his home).</p>
<h2>2. Aerobic Exercise</h2>
<p>Much like tears, sweat removes toxins from our bodies and reduces both the mental and physical impact of stress. Next time you feel a mass of pent up frustration beginning to negatively affect your body, go for a run. Each step and bead of sweat will bring you closer to a state of calm. Yoga is also a popular way to cope with stress.</p>
<p><em>Note: Read up on one of <a href="https://www.dietspotlight.com/smart-goals-weight-loss/" target="_blank">our therapist&#8217;s thoughts on dieting and weight loss</a>.</em></p>
<h2>3. Take a Hot Epsom Salt Bath</h2>
<p>Epsom salt is one of those miracle substances I learned of while looking for methods to soothe my muscles. To treat aches and sores — related to stress or not — try heating up a bath and adding a little Epsom salt. Then take deep breaths, meditate and enjoy the relaxing sensations.</p>
<h2>4. Get a Massage or Try Rolfing</h2>
<p>Massages may be expensive, but it is worth occasionally paying for one. Your body might need help relaxing. Why not treat yourself at least once?</p>
<p>If you haven’t heard of <a href="http://www.rolfusa.com/rolfing.html" target="_blank">Rolfing</a>, here is a quick definition:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Rolfing® is a system of soft tissue manipulation and movement education that organizes the whole body in gravity. Often considered a deep-tissue approach, Rolfing bodywork actually works with all the layers of the body to ease strain patterns in the entire system.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The practice can alleviate chronic stress, according to a <a href="http://www.rolfusa.com/research.html" target="_blank">volume of research</a>.</p>
<p>I stumbled upon Rolfing while seeking treatments to improve my muscle functioning, and it has been a lifesaver for me. The sessions are similar to massages, although the work is more intense and can be a little painful. I recommend Rolfing for people who want dramatic results and don’t mind spending more than they would on a massage.</p>
<h2>5. Try Acupuncture</h2>
<p>I know many people who swear by acupuncture, and I have paid for a few sessions over the years. Like Rolfing, it might do wonders for you if you don’t mind a little pain and discomfort. People typically use the alternative medicine to treat symptoms that can also be physical effects of stress, including aches and digestion problems.</p>
<h2>6. Combine Self-Care with Psychotherapy</h2>
<p>If I hadn’t worked with a therapist to understand how mental health affected my body, I would most likely have died during the worst of my depression, a time when I was unable to sleep for roughly four days. No matter the degree, all of us carry stress in our bodies. Mental health professionals have the skills and experience to help you understand the mind/body connection and learn to manipulate both sides of that equation.</p>
<h2>7. Think About What Is Causing Stress in Your Life</h2>
<p>Addressing sources of stress is as important as treating their physical effects. When your body gets tense or wound up, what are you usually thinking about? What happened before your body reacted? Is it your job, relationships, health, anxiety, maybe something else?</p>
<p>If you have trouble answering these questions, considering connecting with a therapist. A little <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a> might provide valuable insights.</p>
<p>Remember that stress is like a crank that winds up our bodies. Tension increases until we can’t function as well as we would like. Use these tips to consciously reverse that process. Take care of both your body and mind.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tuesday in September. I remember what a beautiful day it was. It made everything else that happened seem all the more surreal. I had woken up to go to my first day of grad school at NYU&#8217;s uptown Institute of Fine Arts. On my way out the door I turned on Howard Stern, talk radio being my low-tech burglar deterrent after a recent break in of my Bronx apartment. Someone had called in about the first plane crash. Howard didn&#8217;t know if it was a joke and neither did I. I turned on CNN and saw the second plane crash. And then I headed out the door to the subway. It was terrible, but the towers were still standing and I didn&#8217;t want to be late on my first day. After all, the city kept working when the Trade Center had been bombed years earlier.</p>
<p>I got as far as 86 St. on the 5 train, everyone talking about what was happening. But, from there, the MTA was sending all the trains back uptown, so I got out and walked south, the sky a clear and perfect blue, marred only by black clouds of smoke to the south. As I walk I heard the radios of parked cars, the 1010WINS news station dopplering as I passed each car. The first tower was down.<span id="more-6649"></span></p>
<p>At school, everyone who&#8217;d made it in was huddled around a single television. There&#8217;d be no classes. The second tower fell. Cell lines and land lines were jammed. The internet, designed to withstand nuclear attacks, delivered emails without trouble. Everyone was trying to check in, to reassure each other they were okay, they were alive.</p>
<p>People worried. What would be hit next? The UN? The Statue of Liberty? The Metropolitan Museum of Art, a block away from us?</p>
<p>I finally got through to my friend who worked in the shadow of the towers. He answered the phone himself at his parents&#8217; home in Westchester. He&#8217;d walked to Grand Central from Wall St. and taken the last train out.</p>
<p>My boyfriend, walking the opposite direction from Columbia Presbyterian, collected me and we headed for his apartment across Central Park near Lincoln Center. In the nearly empty park, the great meadow, home to so many memorable concerts was covered in millions of pigeons, every bird seeking green safety in a shaken world. A New York city pigeon is more pedestrian than aerial animal, often jogging along the sidewalk to avoid flying. Now the flock rose en masse whenever anyone came near, whirling, then setting back.</p>
<p>I spent the next three days in my boyfriend&#8217;s room, doing what the rest of New York was doing, watching the 24-hour news. Crying over the same images, repeating over and over, reinforcing our collective traumatic stress. We wanted to help, but there was nothing to be done. You couldn&#8217;t even give blood, the banks were full.</p>
<p>School eventually started back up, but art history seemed pretty meaningless in the face of people dying. The beautiful, converted Fifth Avenue mansion the school was housed in, which had delighted me when I visited the year before, gave me panic attacks. I could be sitting across from a professor, in the civilized clutter of their office while they told me I had done well on a presentation, but I would feel like I was going to pass out, throw up, and die. I couldn&#8217;t concentrate. My grades slipped. I lost my full-ride scholarship.</p>
<p>I finally started going to the student health center for therapy and medication, then, when my sessions there ran out, I was sent to St. Vincent hospital in the West Village to get a full time therapist. Part of this process was an assessment by a resident at the hospital. After sitting in a general waiting room with people who were obviously suffering from psychiatric crisis far beyond my relatively petty problems, I felt guilty I was even there, taking up their valuable resources.</p>
<p>I told the resident this and he said that he would rather work with someone like me because, while we all needed help, I was going to get better. I took heart in that. And though it took years, I eventually did get better, if not well. There was no eureka moment. But the panic attacks hit me less frequently, the anxiety ebbed lower. I didn&#8217;t get my degree, but I got a good job in another field. I got off my meds. When anxiety resurfaced I tried CBT techniques, if that wasn&#8217;t enough I started seeing someone again. It comes and goes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll never know if I would have developed generalized anxiety disorder if that September day had been an uneventful first day of class. There was no control in this experiment. Perhaps there was some quirk of genetics and upbringing that laid a fault line in my psyche that was just waiting to crack.</p>
<p>I do know, even though no one I personally knew was hurt that day, my city and myself were permanently altered.</p>
