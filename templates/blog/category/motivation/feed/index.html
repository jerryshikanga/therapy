				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keeping a laundry list of tasks and to-dos in order can be a headache for anyone, but for some people, the difficulty goes beyond mere annoyance. Starting work each morning can feel like wrangling a bear — and often, that bear is your mind. No, work won&#8217;t always be easy (it&#8217;s called <i>work</i> for a reason), but it doesn&#8217;t need to be the bane of your day-to-day existence.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand what about task management pains you. Is it stressful? Are you overwhelmed? Are you so nitpicky that you get stuck on tasks for days? When task management turns from an annoyance into a daily struggle, step back and examine your mental health. Understanding the blocks your brain puts up during working hours will help you — with the help of a therapist if you choose — create a plan of attack.</p>
<p><span id="more-9972"></span></p>
<p>Many mental health challenges directly affect your brain&#8217;s ability to effectively manage tasks. Identifying the cause helps pinpoint the solution. Below are a few major contributors to ineffective time management.</p>
<h2><b>You&#8217;re Stressed</b></h2>
<p>During stressful periods, thinking about your to-do list makes you break out in sweat. Planning your day each morning feels like a momentous chore. And knocking off the tiniest task — sometimes even as tiny as brushing your teeth — requires all the determination you can muster.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a reason people with anxiety often struggle with time management: stress transforms your brain into a worry-monster. Easily achievable tasks become impossible snow-capped mountains. Soon, your days are filled with avoidance behaviors, and the pile of must-be-done work looms higher and higher.</p>
<p>Many people with anxiety disorders struggle to manage their time appropriately, and working with a <a href="https://talkspace.com/online-therapy/" target="_blank">qualified therapist</a> can help mitigate the problem. But sometimes, the culprit is less severe. Review the projects you&#8217;re juggling: Is one causing you undue stress? Perhaps it&#8217;s the 20-page term paper for your hardest class or a end-of-year budget report due to your boss next month. If you can&#8217;t get it off your plate entirely, break it into itsy-bitsy, child-size chunks — and tackle the easiest parts first.</p>
<h2>You Have an Attention Disorder</h2>
<p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) doesn&#8217;t just affect children — <a href="http://www.chadd.org/understanding-adhd/for-adults.aspx" target="_blank">approximately 10 million adults</a> have ADHD. If you grew up in the &#8217;90s or earlier, officials and teachers may have overlooked your disorder. If you went undiagnosed in school, it may feel surprising to find yourself knocking at the door of a therapist years later.</p>
<p>ADHD directly affects your executive function — the part of your brain that regulates time management. So it&#8217;s no surprise that your poor time management could be a symptom! The executive function&#8217;s <a href="https://www.additudemag.com/7-executive-function-deficits-linked-to-adhd/" target="_blank">&#8220;when&#8221; circuit</a> dictates your timeliness and ability to process behaviors in a sequential order, and it&#8217;s often hampered by ADHD.</p>
<p>If you suffer from a complete inability to focus on any one task, consider talking to your therapist about a possible diagnosis. Specialized time management strategies, like jotting down distracting thoughts in a <a href="https://www.additudemag.com/good-habits-cognitive-behavioral-therapy/" target="_blank">dedicated &#8220;I&#8217;ll get to it later&#8221; notebook</a>, can help you check off your to-dos and achieve your goals.</p>
<h2>You Have Obsessive Tendencies</h2>
<p>You might think that obsessive-compulsive disorder lends itself well to task management, but that&#8217;s not always true. With severe cases, sufferers may find themselves caught in a compulsive loop, unable to move on from one project or task until they&#8217;ve checked off an obscure set of mental requirements. If you find yourself trapped in these cycles, talk to a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a> to get the help you deserve.</p>
<p>OCD can also manifest in smaller, yet equally destructive, ways. Perhaps you&#8217;re hyper-focused on keeping your desk in perfect order so you can concentrate better. Or your mind becomes preoccupied with the idea of getting fired — so much so that you can&#8217;t get work done. These <a href="https://adaa.org/learn-from-us/from-the-experts/blog-posts/consumer/how-take-power-back-intrusive-thought-ocd" target="_blank">intrusive thoughts</a> may not feel like &#8220;traditional&#8221; OCD as portrayed in books and movies, so it&#8217;s understandable if you’re unable to connect the dots.</p>
<h2>You&#8217;re Depressed</h2>
<p>Feeling down in the dumps? Knocking tasks off your to-do list may be the last thing on your mind. When you&#8217;re struggling to feel <i>anything</i>, you probably don&#8217;t worry too much about the consequences of blowing off the deadline on your next big task. Depression is one of the most common <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28476148" target="_blank">disabilities</a>, but it doesn&#8217;t have to keep you frozen.</p>
<p>If every day feels like a slog, work may be the last thing you want to do. And you shouldn&#8217;t force yourself to power through the pain just to satisfy a boss — but that doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t try to find a solution that fits you and your lifestyle. Speak with a licensed therapist, who can help identify strategies for succeeding despite your depression. Acknowledging your sickness (and it <i>is</i> a sickness) goes a long way towards treating it.</p>
<p>Mental health struggles may seem scary, but with time and <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_POST_INLINE&amp;utr_adgroup=struggle-with-time-management-heres-what-it-might-say-about-your-mental-health?utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/time-management-mental-health/" target="_blank">therapy</a>, they don&#8217;t have to impede your working life. Identifying the root cause behind your struggles with task management means you&#8217;ll be back to knocking out your tasks like Muhammad Ali soon enough.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This story is a part of our Mental Health Confessions series, a collection of stories from people who open up about times they felt guilty or conflicted about their mental health issue.</em></p>
<p>I’m pretty tolerant of most types of people, but I absolutely hate flakes. I have cut off friendships because I can’t deal with others’ flakiness, especially when it comes down to repeated incidents of bailing on plans at the last minute.</p>
<p>However, some might say I’m a hypocrite. Why? My mental illness, at times, causes me to become the very type of person I hate.</p>
<p>Friendship is a two-way street. We expect our friends to put in the same amount of time and emotional labor into maintaining a relationship as we do ourselves. Of course, we know this isn’t always the case, and I’ll be the first to admit it: with some of my friends, I feel like I am giving less than I’m getting. I’ve flaked on even the best of my best friends, and I fear one day they’ll decide to cut me loose because of it.<span id="more-6458"></span></p>
<p>My diagnoses are Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Both of these mental illnesses can — and usually do — present with a slew of physical symptoms on top of all the mental ones (as if feelings of impending doom and chronic worry weren’t enough). If I’m going through a rough patch, there’s likely plenty of horrible thoughts and physiological sensations that are nagging at me, holding me back from something as simple as a lunch date.</p>
<p>It all started at age 11 when I moved to a new town and developed my anxiety disorder. I was constantly plagued by symptoms like stomach aches and chest pains, and I had no idea how to cope with what I was feeling. These ailments caused me to skip out on nearly every birthday party or outing I was invited to, which led to even more anxiety.</p>
<p>How was I going to make friends in a new town if I never socialized? Even if I was feeling alright on the day of an event, I still bailed because I was anticipating having a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/anxiety-attack-vs-panic-attack-one/" target="_blank">panic attack</a> there. Staying home and being bored would be better than having a breakdown in front of peers. Sometimes, at age 24, I still have the same thought.</p>
<p>I remember one day, years later, I laid on my floor for about three hours hysterically crying, hating myself, and hating the cards I had been dealt in life. Over and over, I asked myself, “Why me?” Family members came knocking on my door to check on me and I screamed at them to leave. I was supposed to be participating in a breast cancer walk with my best friend and a team that had been assembled, but I couldn’t get off the floor, let alone stop my tears. I sent her the kind of text I dread receiving right before a scheduled plan.</p>
<p><em>“I’m so sorry, but I don’t think I can make it&#8230;”</em></p>
<p>Of course I elaborated about how I was in a horrible state of mind, but I was so embarrassed and ashamed that I didn’t feel strong enough to push through the feelings, leave the house, and go to the walk. I was a flake, and my mental illness was my excuse.</p>
<p>I’m self-deprecating enough, and doing this — annoying my friends, letting them down — makes me even harder on myself. No matter how many times they say, “Don’t worry, I totally understand! There’s always next time!” I can’t help but be overcome with guilt.</p>
<p>So, I know, we all hate flakes, and we hate excuses. We often question if the excuses are some extravagant lie (or is that just me and my trust issues?). But maybe we should cut these people some slack. If someone <em>does</em> truly suffer from mental illness, their flakiness comes with good reason.</p>
<p>I hope that one day I’ll be able to push through the thoughts and feelings that keep me from doing everything I want to do, that mental illness will not hold me back and will no longer be an excuse.</p>
<p>Until then, please bear with my flakiness.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>“I just have way too much motivation. I don’t know what to do with it all!” said no one ever.</h2>
<p class="BodyA"><em>&#8211; by Melissa Wildt, MS, LMHC / Talkspace Therapist</em></p>
<p>Do you ever find yourself procrastinating and you’re not sure why? It’s absolutely true that the longer we put off doing something, the more stress it can cause us in the long run. Most of us know how this can feel, but not how using strategic motivation can help end this cycle of frustration.<span id="more-1180"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Motivation is &#8216;the reason or reasons one has for acting or behaving in a particular way.'&#8221; <a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=“&lt;strong&gt;Motivation &lt;/strong&gt;is 'the reason or reasons one has for acting or behaving in a particular way.'” http://bit.ly/1IFzGUk via @talkspace"> [tweet this] </a></p></blockquote>
<p class="BodyA">If you already know what you’d like to accomplish, the next step involves finding the drive to do it! Below are some of the tips I find to be really helpful, and hopefully so will you.</p>
<h4 class="BodyA">1. First, you should identify your goal.</h4>
<p class="BodyA">Knowing <em>what</em> you want and <em>why</em> can be motivation in and of itself. Write down a list of all the reasons why your goal is particularly important to you. Review your list regularly, especially when you feel like slipping. And make sure your goal is SMART: Specific. Measurable. Attainable. Realistic. Timely.</p>
<h4 class="BodyA">2. Next, make an action plan to help you realize your goals.</h4>
<p class="BodyA">Motivation can come from understanding <em>how</em> to attain your goal. More likely than not, you can break down your initial goal into smaller goals. Try using baby steps to help you get started, and take progressively larger steps as you get more comfortable adhering to your action plan. Doing this will make your goal seem a lot more manageable and by far less overwhelming.</p>
<h4 class="BodyA">3. Use extrinsic motivation…<em>Treat yo’self</em>!</h4>
<p>Extrinsic motivation is just a fancy way of saying we’re motivated by factors outside of ourselves, such as money, good grades, losing weight, etc. Decide how to appropriately reward yourself for reaching certain milestones, such as receiving a good grade on a test or losing a few pounds.</p>
<p>This is a great way to positively reinforce your action plan, and an even greater way to justify treating yourself to a massage or a pair of new shoes. No matter how old you are, getting a reward is satisfying.</p>
<h4>4. Evaluate your energy levels.</h4>
<p>Your lack of motivation can have a lot to do with a lack of energy. Determine if any of the usual culprits are negatively affecting you: restless sleep, stress, poor diet, or even depression. Make sure you’re taking good care of yourself by getting enough sleep, eating a nutritious diet, and incorporating daily activities that manage stress. Also, make sure that your caffeine intake isn&#8217;t out of control!</p>
<h4>5. Watch the excuses!</h4>
<p>Motivation means not making excuses. Be brutally honest and ask yourself, “What is getting in the way of me reaching my goals?” Eliminate the negative factors. Negative thinking, for example, is a common barrier for someone working on reaching his or her goals. It&#8217;s a self-fulfilling prophecy &#8211; so if you think you can’t reach your goal, you probably won’t.</p>
<h4>6. Lastly, get some support!</h4>
<p>Motivation is contagious. Whenever possible, try finding a group of other people that have the same or similar goals as you. Or, consider seeking out a therapist for additional support. Just like a personal trainer can help someone reach their physical goals, a therapist can help someone reach their emotional goals. Most importantly though, let your friends and family know about your goal &#8211; they will be your biggest supporters and can help keep you accountable for your progress.</p>
<p>Use these tips to find the motivation you need to complete the goals you have &#8211; and, of course, do your best to stick with it! Good luck!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>It’s no secret that pursuing a dream can be a significant challenge.</h2>
<p>It takes fierce courage and often requires extreme sacrifice; discouragement and competition are often pre-requisites for success. Sometimes, it means making the choice to follow a path not supported nor accepted by family and friends, and can even mean repeatedly putting yourself in situations that are less than conducive to good emotional, physical, and mental health. The ramifications of such renunciation, as you can imagine, may lead to significant effects on a person’s wellbeing.<span id="more-846"></span></p>
<p>In <em><a title="The Courage to Create via Amazon.com" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Courage-Create-Rollo-May/dp/0393311066" target="_blank">The Courage to Create</a>, </em>by the late and beloved existential psychologist Rollo May, consciousness is described as “the awareness that emerges out of the dialectical tension between possibilities and limitations.” May goes on to hypothesize that, “limits are not only unavoidable in human life, they are also valuable&#8230;the creative act arises out of the struggle of human beings with and against that which limits them.” In other words, it is the struggle and the limits we face that can be used to help us achieve our goals in life; you can even say they’re necessary.</p>
<p>It is of utmost importance to take clear and concise steps towards your dream, while keeping your happiness, health, and welfare in mind. Because a dream-chaser has the unique ability to make healthy and responsible choices against adversity, I am giving you seven ways to chase your dream responsibly.</p>
<h4>SET A SCHEDULE</h4>
<p>An ambiguous lifestyle will not help you achieve your dream. Help yourself by staying on track and surrounding yourself with people that promote healthy lifestyle choices. Focus on exercising, as well as eating and sleeping well. Know what is needed for you to make your dream come true – dreams do not magically come to fruition &#8211; you must work hard to set yourself up for success.</p>
<h4>CULTIVATE SUPPORT</h4>
<p>A support system is vital, especially if you’re away from home or disconnected from family. Cultivate support &#8211; whether it’s in the form of like-minded colleagues or fellow dreamers, or by reconnecting with old friends and establishing new friendships. A strong social network will help keep you from feeling isolated and depressed.</p>
<h4>FIND INSPIRATION</h4>
<p>Look for ways to get inspired &#8211; you may not find the strength you need to stay on your path without it. In your darkest moments, inspiration may be the light that helps you push forward. So, acknowledge and accept a mentor. Experienced dreamers, the ones that have previously succeeded, may help you pave the way. Their wisdom is compelling; the marvel of what they have created may encourage you to keep fighting for your dreams when they seem beyond your grasp.</p>
<h4>DON’T SELF-MEDICATE</h4>
<p>Find healthy ways to self-soothe. Engaging in self- medicating, or other activities that do not promote health and positive self-esteem will only stall your progress. Know your weaknesses, and commit to being proactive and honest with yourself. There’s no need to make the existing struggle more complicated – accept opportunities that help you self-actualize and promote personal enlightenment.</p>
<h4>CHOOSE CONFIDENCE</h4>
<p>There is nothing more detrimental than negative self-talk and irrational core beliefs. Achievers are often their own worst critics, and while constructive introspection is essential, mentally beating yourself up will never lead to success. Find ways to challenge disruptive and/or negative thoughts and feelings. You may have to dig deep to find their roots, but this path must be taken if you want to make your dream come true.</p>
<h4>HELP OTHERS</h4>
<p>Find ways to love yourself and other people. By giving back and helping your community, or by assisting people in getting what they want, you will be motivated to excel in your own life. Combat competition. Selfishness and entitlement will never make you a team player. You must be willing to pay your dues and demonstrate respect for yourself and others, in order to have support when chasing your dreams. Ultimately you will get what you deserve.</p>
<h4>DO NOT GIVE UP</h4>
<p>The moment you throw your hands down could be the moment you would have attained your dream had you kept going. Use the advice and healthy limitations outlined to chase your dream responsibly. Open your heart to the possibilities, and take good care of yourself.</p>
<h3>Know what you want, and work hard to make your dream your reality &#8211; there is infinite beauty in doing so!</h3>
