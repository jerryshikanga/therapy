				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It would be nice if every relationship had a straight 50/50 power dynamic split&#8230;but those in relationships will tell you that’s probably not the case in their partnership. Relationships <i>should</i> be about a shared, equal bond, where partners are teammates who make compromises and share power, rather than a coach versus team member dynamic. Right?</p>
<p><span id="more-11461"></span></p>
<p>Think about this common question couples get asked: “So, who wears the pants in this relationship?” Usually, pop culture tells us the man in a heterosexual couple should “wear the pants.” If the woman “wears the pants” the man is looked at as “whipped” and sometimes even teased for it. By talking about and asking who’s <i>wearing the pants</i>, we’re perpetuating the idea that one person should be in charge.</p>
<p>It’s like society <i>demands </i>one person hold more power in the relationship. What happened to equality?</p>
<h2>Why Dominant Roles Exist in Relationships</h2>
<p>There are multiple reasons why one person may exert more power in a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relationship</a>.</p>
<p>“[Roles in relationships] depend on experiences in our lives,” Kimberly Leitch, LCSW-R and Talkspace therapist, says, “Someone may have been in a controlling relationship previously and now they tend to be in control of their present relationship in fear of repeating the same mistakes. The importance of balance varies with each person.”</p>
<p>Of course, there are other life events that can cause someone to be the controlling partner in a relationship — even events from <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/can-childhood-traumas-cause-panic-disorder/">childhood</a>. For example, if somebody had very controlling parents, it’s common that they too might desire control, even in a romantic relationship. Or, if someone experienced lots of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/11/why-rejection-hurts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejection</a> as they were growing up, they might take extreme measures in relationships to make sure they aren’t rejected or abandoned again.</p>
<h2>When it’s Okay to Defer to Your Partner</h2>
<p>In certain cases, taking ownership of the power dynamic is okay, if it’s in a healthy way, and makes sense for each partner.</p>
<p>“There are some personality types that like to relinquish the control onto their partner because they cannot handle the stress of the responsibilities or being in control elicits <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a>.” Leitch says. “I have a client whose husband works and therefore she is in charge of everything else [at home] and it works in their relationship. He also tends to be a passive person whereas she is a big personality and tends to be more assertive. He follows her lead and he doesn’t have to be bothered making decisions.”</p>
<p>In this case, the skewed power dynamic makes sense, so long as the passive partner continues to feel okay with the arrangement, and speaks up if they want more say in decisions around the house.</p>
<p>Even in situations like the one Leitch described, an imbalance of power can definitely turn unhealthy.</p>
<p>“It becomes an issue when you feel like you are not being heard and there is no sense of <i>you</i> in the relationship. It can lead you to feel uncomfortable and insecure.” Leitch explains, “You may feel like you are submitting to your partner’s likes or interests, which is not being reciprocated. It is important to communicate these feelings with your partner to avoid any negative feelings or behaviors.”</p>
<p>If you land in a place like this, where you feel like you don’t have a voice in your relationship, it’s definitely time to reevaluate your partnership and roles. Allowing an unhealthy power dynamic to persist can take a toll on even the strongest relationship.</p>
<h2>What to Do When You’ve Lost Control in a Relationship</h2>
<p>Here are some things you can do if you feel like your partner is being too controlling, or the power dynamic has shifted in an unfavorable way.</p>
<h3>Be introspective</h3>
<p>Look inside yourself and ask <i>why </i>you’re putting up with being bossed around. Do you feel worthy of healthy love? Are you scared of losing your partner? Are you feeling stuck because you’re scared your partner might physically hurt you if you try to leave? Are <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/how-to-recognize-emotional-abuse-in-intimate-relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controlling relationships</a> all you know?</p>
<p>Journal about your feelings, speak to a loved one, or bring it up in therapy.</p>
<h3>Communicate with your partner</h3>
<p>It’s possible your partner might not even realize how controlling they’re being. Speak up about your feelings, and explain the situation from your point of view in a non-confrontational manner. Spell out scenarios where your partner made you feel poorly about yourself or controlled.</p>
<p>Try to stay calm and level headed. As with any conflict in a relationship, communication is key. While it can be awkward to start a difficult conversation with a partner, learning to do so is crucial.</p>
<h3>Be confident and stand strong</h3>
<p>All too often, people lose themselves when they are in a controlling relationship. Stand your ground and try to take back some of your power in subtle ways by remaining <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/5-ways-improve-body-image-confidence-mental-health/">confident</a> and aware. It may also help to be more independent than usual, which helps you prove to yourself that you can be independent and take care of yourself. Keep your guard up so you can’t be so easily manipulated.</p>
<h3>Give couples therapy a try</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/couples-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Couples therapy</a> is great for couples who are struggling with any problem. A couple’s therapist can provide a safe space for each person to voice their concerns, and the therapist can help facilitate the conversation as well as help the couple understand each other. It can also help ease your nerves if you’re scared of confronting your partner one on one.</p>
<h3>Recognize signs of abuse</h3>
<p>Sadly, domestic abuse is common. Controlling behavior can sometimes be a sign or predictor of abusive behavior. Educate yourself on <a href="https://www.thehotline.org/is-this-abuse/abuse-defined/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the signs of domestic abuse</a> so you can be aware of what’s going on in your relationship and if things are on the road to getting dangerous.</p>
<p>If you believe you are being abused, tell a loved one and get in touch with an organization like <a href="https://www.thehotline.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The National Domestic Abuse Hotline</a> for help. This step also goes along with knowing when it’s time to walk away from the relationship and leave before it gets any worse.</p>
<h2>No Relationship is Perfect, but it Should Be Healthy</h2>
<p>While no relationship is perfect, and you shouldn’t necessarily strive for “perfect,” everybody deserves a safe, healthy relationship. A super controlling partner definitely does not equate to a healthy and happy relationship.</p>
<p>It’s okay to share duties and give up control of some areas or aspects of a relationship, but always be aware of your feelings, recognize controlling partners, and look out for the signs of abuse. Nobody deserves to feel powerless or unsafe in a relationship.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The night of my first <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/02/dating-someone-with-anxiety-what-you-need-to-know-and-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">date</a> with my ex, I felt strong, instant chemistry. The butterflies in my stomach felt more like large birds, and each kiss felt like 4th of July fireworks. Actually, even just looking at him made me feel fireworks!</p>
<p>We became official, and from there…it went downhill. Why? We were lacking consistency and things that came along with it, like trust. Once I wasn’t so blinded by chemistry, I realized we weren’t <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/is-your-relationship-over-5-questions-to-ask-before-calling-it-quits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compatible</a> and there were aspects of the relationship that were not healthy. When it came down to it, we wanted different things in life. There were parts of him I could not accept and parts of me that he could not accept.<span id="more-11447"></span></p>
<p>I learned it the hard way: Sparks are fun, but they’re not what makes a relationship last.</p>
<h2>The Difference Between Relationship Chemistry and Consistency</h2>
<p>This isn’t to say chemistry isn’t important in relationships — of course it is, particularly at the beginning! However, people who have experienced amazing, unbelievable chemistry (like me) can be the first to tell you that chemistry <i>does not</i> equal consistency, and it definitely doesn’t equal a long lasting and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/guide-setting-healthy-boundaries-relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy relationship</a>.</p>
<p>As with many things, the key is <i>balance. </i>Chemistry comes naturally and easily, and that’s part of what’s so great about it. Consistency, on the other hand, takes work and dedication to a partner.</p>
<h3>Relationship chemistry explained</h3>
<p>To better understand and break down chemistry versus consistency, I spoke to Cynthia Catchings, LCSW-S and Talkspace therapist.</p>
<p>“Chemistry is the initial feeling we have when we are attracted to someone. It has also been described as the biological effects of lust and attraction,” Catchings explains. “Experiencing these feelings can mean we feel we are on cloud nine and somewhat blind to reality. Although chemistry is a fantastic feeling, it is not the most important predictor of a good relationship. Basically, it is just a feeling that masks our significant other’s worst traits and lures us into putting up with them. Now, is chemistry fun and worth the ride? Absolutely, but only if we are aware that it is just part of a phase.”</p>
<p>You might be aware of this phase, often referred to as the <b><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/12/commitment-issues-reasons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">honeymoon phase</a></b>. During this time, fights are often minimal (or perhaps even non-existent) and it seems like our partner can do no wrong. Chemistry is peaking, butterflies are flying, and a lot of sex is probably being had.</p>
<p>Once the honeymoon phase is over, consistency is key. Any couple can probably make it through their honeymoon phase — it’s what comes next that’s harder and determines whether a relationship will last.</p>
<h3>The importance of consistency in a relationship</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/02/everything-you-need-to-know-about-couples-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Couples</a> will inevitably face hardship, have to make tough decisions, and run into <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/is-it-a-normal-fight-or-verbal-abuse-heres-how-to-tell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conflict</a>. And what’s going to get a couple through that? Consistency.</p>
<p>“Chemistry is necessary and good because it creates the desire and is part of the relationship game,” Catchings says, “However, consistency has to take over for that relationship to succeed.”</p>
<p>Feeling pure lust is a great feeling, and the honeymoon phase is super-fun, but we also must acknowledge the fact that chemistry alone isn’t going to establish an extra-solid foundation for a relationship. Certain relationship aspects, such as trust, don’t really bloom out of chemistry. They’re aspects that must be worked on consistently throughout the relationship.</p>
<p>“Consistency is a combination of behaviors that include dependability, trust, and a true desire to have a companion and form a serious relationship.” Catchings adds, “People who are more consistent with their interactions with one another, such as having predictable behaviors and good <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/07/dear-therapist-im-hearing-you-say-my-communication-skills-need-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">communication</a>, have longer and more successful relationships.”</p>
<h2>How to Start and Maintain a Successful Relationship</h2>
<p>Successful relationships will last once chemistry is no longer at its highest, and once partners have learned enough about each other and their flaws. In the long run, chemistry isn’t always as important as you might think it is.</p>
<p>“Think of a relationship as a cake,” Catchings suggests. “The chemistry is the frosting and the consistency is the bread. The frosting can be too sweet or melt, so it’s okay if it is not there. It just gives the cake a nice look and some sweetness.”</p>
<p>If you’re just starting out in a new relationship, encourage yourself to dig deeper than the chemistry and initial attraction. Learn about your partner, and allow your partner “inside” your world and your past so that they can learn about you, too.</p>
<p>It’s also great to be upfront about your desires and needs throughout the relationship. If you’ve already been together for a while and you’re missing the feeling of exciting chemistry, you can attempt to bring some <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/7-relationship-myths-debunked-by-a-therapist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">romance</a> and excitement back into your partnership by trying new activities together, experimenting with new things in bed, or going on a romantic getaway!</p>
<p>As Catchings puts it, “consistency is a more pure form of love that lets us know that we are in the right relationship.”</p>
<h2>Every Relationship is Different</h2>
<p>In the end, every relationship is different, and every couple will encounter their own set of problems. Each relationship will balance chemistry and consistency in different ways.</p>
<p>It may take a lot of work to find the right balance, or even to find the right partner to get the balance right, but when it comes to relationships, everything is a great learning experience.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you’ll end up with a delicious cake — topped just the right amount of perfectly sweet frosting.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nobody is immune to rejection. Even the most beautiful and talented people have been rejected in one way or another. When you take risks in life, you face the possibility that you might be shut down or might not make the cut.</p>
<p><span id="more-11294"></span></p>
<p>Different phases of life bring different opportunities and situations where we’ve got to put ourselves out there and be vulnerable. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/6-quick-tips-to-maintain-your-mental-health-while-dating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dating</a>, high school sports tryouts, college applications, and job interviews are a few prime examples. There’s a reason you probably shudder at the thought of these experiences — they all come with a reasonable chance of rejection, and the odds are pretty good that you’ve experienced rejection already in one of these contexts<i>. </i></p>
<p>As much as we’d like for everything to always go our way, that’s not the way the universe works. While rejection is pretty much inevitable in some capacity, it still hurts. It’s painful to get shut down for something you want, whether it’s a date with a crush or a job at your dream company. We all want to be loved, cherished, and accepted — be it by a romantic partner, friend group, or boss.</p>
<p>Rejection can cause us to feel a slew of emotions, ranging from confusion to sadness to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/anger-emotions-run-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rage</a>. Oftentimes, people don’t understand exactly why they’ve been rejected, which can lead to a downward spiral of negative introspection and an overall sense of not feeling “good enough.”</p>
<p>Social and romantic rejection can be especially traumatic and negative for our self esteem. “Humans are inherently social creatures. We crave connection and meaning to others. When faced with rejection, or lack of acceptance, it&#8217;s hard of us to not internalize negative thoughts about our own self-worth. Rejection brings up the existential crisis of ‘alone-ness,’ which is quite painful and hard to ignore,” <a href="https://twitter.com/jorelcaraballo?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Jor-El Caraballo</a>, LMHC and Talkspace therapist, explains.</p>
<h2>The Science of Rejection</h2>
<p>On top of being hard to ignore, instances of rejection can also be pretty hard to forget.</p>
<p>Personally, I remember moments of rejection even as far back as elementary school. I had a huge crush on a boy in my class, and during lunch time I asked him who he thought was prettier, me or this other girl in class. He chose — you guessed it — the other girl. It hurt! I remember that day, and how it felt to hear those words, vividly. I’ve wondered, why is this memory and the feelings around it still so clear to me?</p>
<p>“Memories are complex processes that occur in the brain. Highly emotional experiences, like rejection, get stored in the brain and remain there thanks to the amygdala [a part of the brain] that attaches meaning to experience,” Caraballo says. “If you&#8217;re someone who has struggled with rejection, and that gets reinforced in various scenarios so that it gains meaning and importance — even in small ways — that rejection turns into our pervading emotional story.”</p>
<p>Besides the fact that being rejected straight up <i>sucks</i>, there’s actually scientific data and evolutionary research that helps us better understand the pain of rejection, and why the pain is so distinct.</p>
<p><a href="https://sanlab.psych.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2015/05/Eisenberger2012PsychosamaticMed.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Studies using MRI brain scans</a> have shown that the same region of the brain that is activated while experiencing physical pain is also activated while experiencing emotional pain, like rejection. However, there’s an interesting difference to be noted when it comes to re-living emotional pain.</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0128294&amp;type=printable" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Another study showed</a> that re-living emotional pain is more unpleasant, and results in more brain activity, than re-living physical pain. The study also confirmed that it’s easier for us to recount details and feelings from occurrences of emotional pain than physical pain. This explains why it hurts more to reflect on the time you got dumped than to the time you broke your arm.</p>
<p>Continuing with the “broken arm” example, we get patched up and are typically as good as new in a few months. Emotional pain, however, can linger for decades if we don’t learn ways to heal its lasting wounds.</p>
<h2>How to Recover from Rejection</h2>
<p>So, how do you pick yourself back up after facing rejection? There are a few things you can do to make yourself feel better about the situation&#8230;and prepare yourself better for the next time you may face rejection.</p>
<h3>Allow yourself to feel</h3>
<p>Rather than suppressing all the emotions that come with rejection, allow yourself to feel and process them. Holding in your negative emotions and bottling up all the feelings is no good for you.</p>
<p>“I think that like many other experiences we often tell people that their feelings don&#8217;t matter and they should ‘just get over it.’ We could really stand to focus more on creating space for people to feel their feelings, even rejection, and find ways to feel it and cope rather than just ignoring the pain and making it all better,” Caraballo says.</p>
<h3>Spend time with people who accept you</h3>
<p>Surround yourself with people who love you and accept you. While it may be tempting to isolate yourself further when you&#8217;re feeling upset over rejection, it’s important to be at least a little social with loved ones.</p>
<p>Remember that you <i>are </i>loved and appreciated, and don’t let an act of rejection make you believe otherwise. You can’t always be accepted for every opportunity or by every person — and that’s okay! The people around you will remind you that you’re loved and valued.</p>
<h3>Practice self love and self care</h3>
<p>It’s <i>so </i>important to love and have a positive relationship with yourself. Doing so will help you be more resilient with future instances of rejection.</p>
<p>Make a list of the positive traits you have that you’re proud of, inside and out. Appreciate the parts of yourself that you love, and work on cultivating good self esteem. You can also make a list of your accomplishments, both big and small.</p>
<p>Be sure to carve some time out for <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/self-care-stop-stress-secrets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self care</a>. You can journal or create art to express your emotions, take a hot bath to zone out, or head to a fitness class like kickboxing to burn off some anger.</p>
<h2>Rejection is a Natural Part of Our Lives, Embrace it!</h2>
<p>So, next time you’re facing rejection (which hopefully won’t be soon) remember that your feelings are totally valid, and it’s okay to feel sad when you’re going through it.</p>
<p>It’s a part of this crazy ride we call life, and if you want to live it to the fullest, you’ve gotta pick yourself back up when you get knocked down.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The anxiety starts in my chest and then blooms, smothering my lungs and filling my belly: a guy has just asked me out. <i>Oh no</i>, I think, panicked. <i>Am I interested? How do I turn him down?</i></p>
<p><span id="more-11289"></span></p>
<p>I’m not a character in a preteen novel, with butterflies in her stomach because she’s never been asked on a date. It’s definitely not my first rodeo. I have, however, had bad experiences of being asked out by men who couldn’t take no for an answer — including one guy who harassed me online for two years after I declined a date with him. With <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/21/587671849/a-new-survey-finds-eighty-percent-of-women-have-experienced-sexual-harassment" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">81 percent</a> of women having experienced some kind of sexual harassment, I’m definitely not alone in this anxiety.</p>
<p>But even for people who haven’t experienced <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/sexual-harassment-is-about-mental-health-not-only-the-workplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harassment</a>, turning someone down can be pretty, well, awkward. Walking the line between clarity and tact can feel like a serious high-wire act. This can be especially true for women, who are often trained to prioritize other people’s feelings over our own boundaries.</p>
<p>So what’s a person to do? To find out, I consulted the experts: Rachel O’Neill, Ph.D., an Ohio-licensed professional clinical counselor and Talkspace therapist, and Olivia Harris, a consent educator and Incoming Executive Director of <a href="http://speakaboutitonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Speak About It,</a> a nonprofit group that uses performance to educate high school and college students about consent.</p>
<p>Here’s what they had to say about why turning down someone’s romantic attention can be so darn tricky, and how you can learn to assert your boundaries with grace and aplomb.</p>
<h2>Saying “No” Can Be Difficult</h2>
<p>Whether we’re asking someone out or turning someone down, most of us want to be kind. “The vast majority of people don’t want to be jerks or hurt somebody,” says Olivia Harris.</p>
<p>However, harmful cultural messages about gender and consent, like the idea that a woman’s “no” is sometimes a coquettish “yes,” can make turning down a date particularly difficult for women, whose “no’s” often aren’t listened to or respected. These cultural messages often result in the expectation that women should be responsible for making other people feel good, even at the expense of our own boundaries.</p>
<p>“Feminine people are taught to read the room and do the emotional caretaking of everyone’s feelings,” Harris says.</p>
<p>Dr. Rachel O’Neill agrees. “Often times, people, and women in particular, are socialized to put others’ feelings above their own,” she says.</p>
<h2>Practice Articulating Your Boundaries</h2>
<p>In the face of these cultural messages, saying “no” can take some practice.</p>
<p>It may feel uncomfortable at first, but according to Dr. O’Neill, a little discomfort is worth it. “I’m a big fan of embracing the awkwardness,” she says.</p>
<p>When it comes to turning someone down, Dr. O’Neill advises embracing the awkward by simply being direct. “First and foremost, your primary responsibility is to firmly establish that you’re not interested,” she says. O’Neill also suggests simply saying that you appreciate their interest, but don’t feel the same way.</p>
<p>Like everything else in life, practice makes perfect. Dr. O’Neill suggests practicing saying no in lower-stakes situations: <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/working-hard-burning-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not answering a non-urgent work email after hours</a>, for example, or asking to reschedule when you don’t feel like going out to dinner with friends. That way, when faced with a more high-pressure situation, you’ll feel more comfortable expressing exactly what you’re comfortable with.</p>
<p>Consent isn’t just about saying “yes” or “no” to someone else’s suggestions, it’s also about knowing yourself and what you want. From <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/11/the-complete-online-dating-guide-for-women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dating</a> to sex, “you have to learn how to drive your own car,” Olivia Harris says.</p>
<p>You can reflect on your own desires and boundaries by journaling, talking with friends or a therapist, or using a “Yes, No, Maybe” checklist like <a href="http://www.scarleteen.com/article/advice/yes_no_maybe_so_a_sexual_inventory_stocklist" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">this one</a> from sexual health website Scarleteen. Knowing what you want out of dating and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/sex/">sex</a>, before you find yourself in a flirty situation, can help you figure out whether you <i>really </i>want to go on a date with that cutie at the bar.</p>
<p>Finally, no matter the romantic situation, you <i>always </i>have the right to say no, and to have that “no” respected.</p>
<h2>Learn to Accept Rejection</h2>
<p>Learning how to reject someone is just one half of the equation. What about the person who’s getting rejected?</p>
<p>Dealing with rejection is an important part of consent. By shifting the onus of respectful behavior from the person being asked out to the person doing the asking, Harris says, we can establish interactions based on healthy consent. This can help take the pressure of navigating boundaries off of women.</p>
<p>Because of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/how-men-can-confront-toxic-masculinity-why-its-important-for-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cultural stereotypes</a> around masculinity and consent, this can be a particular challenge for men. “The first step is teaching folks to listen and respect other people’s boundaries,” says Harris, “I think particularly what we’re seeing over and over again is men and masculine folks are not recognizing when they’re hitting boundaries — they’re not taught to.”</p>
<p>To change these attitudes, Harris advocates flipping the script from understanding someone’s “no” as a challenge to viewing it as a boundary that needs to be respected. That requires viewing the other person as a complete human being, rather than viewing them through the lens of our desires. It also requires learning not to take rejection too personally.</p>
<p>Quoting a line from <a href="http://speakaboutitonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Speak About It’s</a> performance, Harris says, “If you’re the person who’s asking and gets rejected, we can guarantee you it might hurt, but you won’t burst into flame.”</p>
<h2>Better Communication Leads to Better Relationships</h2>
<p>Learning how to articulate and respect boundaries isn’t just important in turning someone down, it’s fundamental to healthy relationships.</p>
<p>After all, if someone asking you out won’t take no for an answer, they probably won’t be a very respectful partner. Conversely, being able to communicate your own boundaries isn’t just helpful with people you <i>don’t </i>want to date, it’s a fundamental skill in building healthy relationships with the people you <i>do </i>want to date.</p>
<p>For Dr. Rachel O’Neill, learning to embrace the awkward and express our boundaries clearly, even when that means navigating rejection, is key to romantic happiness. “After all,” she says, “aren’t all great <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relationships</a> built on communication?”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cohabitation is the practice of living with another person while in a relationship, typically of a romantic or sexual nature.</p>
<p>Cohabitation is relatively common these days, with some past estimates (<a href="https://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/p20-570.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">from 2012</a>) indicating that as many as 7.8 million couples were living together, unmarried. This number has dramatically increased in the past few decades as our culture has shifted from a more religious and conservative stance to a more progressive and practical (though anxious) one.</p>
<p>It’s almost more uncommon to meet a couple who hasn’t taken the proverbial “test drive” in cohabiting before marriage. It’s a relatively practical solution to difficult emotional problem — how two people can coexist peacefully and happily under the same roof.</p>
<p><span id="more-11048"></span></p>
<p>Living together can be complicated, but when you are practiced and prepared, it can be an incredibly fulfilling experience.</p>
<h2>First, Embrace Collaboration</h2>
<p>If you’re moving in with your partner, in order to be successful it’s going to require the spirit of collaboration and compromise for both of you. From residence size, price, location, etc., there is a lot to figure out!</p>
<p>Start these conversations with the spirit of collaboration so that you can begin your cohabitation journey on the right foot.</p>
<h2>Take Advice From Friends or Family With a Grain of Salt</h2>
<p>If you tell your friends and family that you plan on moving in with your significant other, there is a high probability that you’re going to get a lot of feedback. Chances are, if it’s your first time moving in with someone, the people around you may have a lot of thoughts and input to share, in hopes of preparing you for success. They are likely to share their own challenges and maybe even the pitfalls they imagine their advice can help you avoid. Some may even think they know your situation better than you. Be cautious but considerate of this feedback, which is typically well-intentioned</p>
<p>No two <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relationships</a> are the same, therefore no cohabitation is exactly the same. Stereotypes are lazy, and gross generalizations about your partner (or men and women in general) are unhelpful when considering this next big step in a relationship.</p>
<p>As you plan to move in with your loved one, take all (unsolicited) advice with a grain of salt. Talk through your concerns with your partner, and try to let the other noise and chatter fall into the background.</p>
<p>On the other hand, don’t forget to do some research of your own, and identify the most important things to consider when moving in together. Input from professionals can help reassure you that you’re making the right decision.</p>
<h2>Take Time to Reflect and Prepare</h2>
<p>Moving in with another person is a big step. If you haven’t lived with a significant other before you may not know what’s most important to you in a shared space.</p>
<p>While you’re still “riding solo,” take a bit of time to do a walk through of your residence (physically and/or mentally). Think of the ordinary things you do that seem benign and natural to you, and take note of them. While these things may seem “right” to you, your partner might have a completely different approach to living. Some things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>How and where you store your grooming products (how many do you have)?</li>
<li>Where and how you store laundry</li>
<li>How you deal with garbage &amp; recycling (where is it located in the home &amp; how often do you dispose of it)?</li>
<li>How often do you clean? Are there must haves for cleaning products, etc.?</li>
</ul>
<p>These may sound silly in the grand scheme of living with someone, but in my experience it’s the little things that really grind your gears on a day-to-day basis. By walking into the shared home with an idea of your pet peeves or related personality clashes, you can preempt these conflicts by proposing solutions or compromises. This will enable you and your partner to focus on the greater emotional impact and changes associated with living together.</p>
<h2>Some Serious Things to Consider in Cohabitation</h2>
<p>There are some not-so-pleasant realities of living together. There will be challenges simply in sharing common space, and as with any relationship, there will also be <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/best-way-fight-partner-according-therapist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conflict</a> to work through.</p>
<p>In addition, there are legal and financial concerns in cohabitating. Partners do well by talking about these issues beforehand and <a href="https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/dos-and-donts-for-cohabitation.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">making some sort of agreement</a> about how finances will be managed.</p>
<p>In research on heterosexual couples, scientists found that those who lived together before marriage tend to have a higher rate of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/200507/the-perils-playing-house?collection=94907" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">marital dissatisfaction, including poorer communication</a>. It should be of note that this study didn’t include a sample of queer or LGBTQ-identified pairings.</p>
<p>And of course, there is the issue of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/07/what-happens-if-your-relationship-expires-every-7-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-term commitment</a>. The research on cohabitation indicates that those who don’t discuss the idea of commitment explicitly beforehand tend to end up in less fulfilling relationships.</p>
<p>Whether or not cohabitation or a permanent (legal) partnership is the end goal, it’s necessary for partners to explore these ideas and possibilities beforehand, rather than wait on having those conversations down the road.</p>
<h2>Choose Your Battles</h2>
<p>Moving in with your partner should not be match of tug-o-war or a battle of wills. There are likely to be plenty of lifestyle choices that you disagree on — from how the toilet paper should be on the holder to who should pay the utility bills monthly.</p>
<p>There are going to be <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/de-escalate-fight-with-partner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">battles that aren’t worth fighting</a> for any discernible amount of time. Sometimes it’s best to let some battles go to keep the relationship healthy and balanced. If you don’t feel strongly about whether you have a paper towel holder on the counter versus mounted, then perhaps defer to your partner who feels much more strongly about one of those options.</p>
<p>Knowing when to fold a bad hand is an important part of any relationship, especially when you’re going to be sharing your home with the one that you love. A <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/02/everything-you-need-to-know-about-couples-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couple&#8217;s counselor</a> can be very helpful in deciding how to mediate disputes.</p>
<h2>What to Consider if the Relationship or Cohabitation Doesn’t Work</h2>
<p>There are certain laws and precedents that dictate what might happen should you later end your relationship, and with it, cohabitation. Issues related to <a href="https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/dos-and-donts-for-cohabitation.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">marriage and domestic partnerships, property ownerships, finances, assets and child care may be important factors</a> in a separation down the line.</p>
<p>To protect yourself and your family, it may be wise to consult with a attorney about the local laws in your area concerning these topics.</p>
<h2>Finally&#8230;Expect the Unexpected</h2>
<p>Inevitably, there are going to be some unknowns you run into when moving in with another person. While there is certainly a lot you can talk through and plan for, we are human and you likely won’t address every little thing.</p>
<p>Sometimes we don’t know what matters most in our living space until we have someone else within it. The best thing we can do in those situations is make sure that we are communicating openly and honestly as much as possible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a couples therapist, I see many couples who are <i>enmeshed</i>, meaning that they have very poor boundaries. This means that both partners are only friends with the same people (or with no people, if partners didn’t agree on which friends were tolerable), they hang out only together, and they have no external interests that aren’t shared.</p>
<p>Often, one or both partners secretly — or openly — feels constricted and trapped within the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/guide-setting-healthy-boundaries-relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relationship</a>. However, they struggle with asserting their own needs or desires for independence, because the relationship has developed into this pattern and there seems like no other option is available.</p>
<p>In the earliest stages of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/6-quick-tips-to-maintain-your-mental-health-while-dating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dating</a>, when it feels like you and your new partner are the only people on earth, it is normal and even healthy to want to spend all of your time together. This is the infatuation or honeymoon stage, and it can feel very intense and amazing. But this stage doesn’t last forever, and it is unhealthy to try to extend it for the entirety of the relationship.</p>
<p><span id="more-10633"></span></p>
<h2>When the Honeymoon is Over</h2>
<p>No matter how in love a couple is, they each need to have a separate life in addition to their shared life, in order to feel whole and healthy.</p>
<p>Most people who are in the honeymoon stage of dating still find the strength to peel themselves away from their new partners to spend time with friends, family, and engage in other interests and activities.</p>
<h3>How Past Dysfunction Leads to Co-Dependence</h3>
<p>But for some people, especially those who did not learn healthy boundaries at home, such as people raised in more <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/12/survive-your-dysfunctional-family-this-holiday-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dysfunctional families</a>, it can feel impossible to set any boundaries in the earliest stages of dating.</p>
<p>If their partner is a similar type of person with a similar upbringing (and often, people with dysfunctional upbringings find one another, even if these family histories are not openly discussed), it is easy to see how the couple ends up, years down the line, in a very enmeshed situation. Partners become <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/09/are-you-in-a-codependent-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">codependent</a> rather than individual people.</p>
<p>If you have had a history of ending up overly dependent on your partner, sacrificing friends, outside interests, and even work or school for the sake of being around your partner 24/7, then you likely could benefit from learning how to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/02/use-boundaries-to-keep-your-individuality-when-you-fall-in-love/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set boundaries</a> with new romantic partners.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you never saw a healthy relationship between parents when growing up, then it is essential that you learn how to set boundaries yourself, before you end up unintentionally replicating whatever unhealthy dynamics you saw as a child.<br />
<a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/online-therapy-with-a-licensed-therapist?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_MID&amp;utr_adgroup=midpost-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=10633&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/dating-set-boundaries-in-earliest-stages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4858 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/darkblue_toughtime.png" alt="tough time blog purchase CTA" width="660" height="240" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/darkblue_toughtime.png 660w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/darkblue_toughtime-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a></p>
<h2>Setting Boundaries in a New Relationship</h2>
<p>The key points to remember when entering a new relationship are that the relationship is not supposed to define you. You were an individual, with your own interests, friends, and obligations before you met your partner, and you will still be that person during and after the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/relationships/">relationship</a>. For that reason, you need to be sure to keep some rules in mind.</p>
<p>Some good boundaries include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never skipping out on work or school obligations for the sake of a new relationship.</li>
<li>Not cancelling plans with friends, and engaging in social activities at least once a week without your new partner.</li>
<li>Not pretending to have all of the same interests as your partner, just so that they don’t go off and do things without you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you genuinely want to learn about your partner’s interests, don’t learn about 100% of them right away. Give your partner space to be themselves, and continuing living your life.</p>
<h3>What to do if Your Partner is Against Healthy Boundaries</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that you may be trying to set up healthy boundaries and your partner may be the one who is pushing for constant contact. In that case, make sure to keep your boundaries intact and tell your new partner that you love spending time with them, but you want to keep your friends and outside interests too.</p>
<p>If this <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/best-way-fight-partner-according-therapist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conversation goes poorly</a>, then you may need to reevaluate whether this is the right relationship for you, or if it will push you into old, dysfunctional patterns.</p>
<h2>Boundaries Keep You (and Your Relationship) Healthy</h2>
<p>Keeping healthy boundaries is an important part of being an independent, healthy adult. If you struggle with this area, therapy is a good idea.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/02/7-fears-might-couples-counseling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couple&#8217;s counselor</a> can help you figure out how to stay true to yourself while also starting a new and exciting relationship. Even (or especially!) if you’re currently single, if you feel that you tend to become enmeshed with partners, <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_POST_INLINE&amp;utr_adgroup=dating-set-boundaries-in-earliest-stages&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/dating-set-boundaries-in-earliest-stages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a therapist can help you explore why you do this</a>, and work with you on a healthier, more authentic and confident way of being.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I joined the online dating scene in 2011, I strategically crafted my profile with the right keywords, phrases, and photos that I thought would grant me the best chance of landing a date, and hopefully, a long-term relationship that would end in marriage. It was challenging to accept this new level of vulnerability and publicly announce that I’m single, looking, and by the way, would you please pick me?</p>
<p>Dating apps like <a href="http://thebeehive.bumble.com/bumble-dating/">Bumble</a> represent some of the highest-grossing social experiences in app stores worldwide. Bumble’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2017/11/14/billion-dollar-bumble-how-whitney-wolfe-herd-built-americas-fastest-growing-dating-app/">$1 billion valuation</a> comes as it surpassed $100 million in revenue in 2017. It reached these heights by offering something different to the dating app experience: letting the other party initiate the conversation.</p>
<p>Dating in the modern era is a process that requires patience as you swipe, click, and message your way through a sea of potential significant others. To safeguard your mental health from the first day you create your profile, follow these key guidelines as you navigate dating apps.</p>
<p><span id="more-10415"></span></p>
<h2>1. Keep it Simple</h2>
<p>It may be tempting to replicate your profile across a dozen dating apps to seemingly increase your chances of success, but think again. Managing connections across multiple platforms can leave your phone<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/study-switching-off-phone-notifications-more-productive-2017-9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> vibrating with notifications</a> all day long, making you feel overwhelmed and exhausted before you’ve really dived in.</p>
<p>Choose one or two sites that fit with your end goals, beliefs, or interests, and focus on those. You’ll be more apt to find compatible matches before you burn out.</p>
<h2>2. Know Your Deal Breakers</h2>
<p>Connecting with hundreds of new people with an array of personalities and backgrounds is thrilling and a major benefit of online dating. It’s important that you enter into this virtual world with a set list of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/dating-red-flags/" target="_blank">deal breakers</a> to help you navigate through the maze of people.</p>
<p>Seeing an attractive photo may sway you to let up your preference for dating a non-smoker or someone without kids. Write down which characteristics are a must for you, and then stick with them.</p>
<h2>3. Stay Strong in Who You Are</h2>
<p>Clicking through Instagram-worthy profile photos day after day can negatively impact our self-esteem and confidence. Social media, in general, has been linked to<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-facebook-makes-us-unhappy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> higher levels of loneliness, envy, anxiety,</a><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563216307543" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> depression,</a> narcissism, and reduced social skills. In one survey,<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/social-medias-impact-on-self-esteem_us_58ade038e4b0d818c4f0a4e4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> 60% of people</a> using social media reported that it impacted their self-esteem, which the behavioral scientist attributed to only seeing the “highlight reel” of people’s lives.</p>
<p>Focus on<a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/281874" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> building up your confidence</a> when using dating apps by repeating positive affirmations, questioning your inner critic, and taking time for self-care.</p>
<h2>4. Keep Real-Life Relationships and Activities</h2>
<p>Building an online dating presence can be a priority while also keeping your real-life hobbies and activities. The<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/08/the-best-and-worst-online-dating-sites.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> likelihood of meeting a first date</a> through a friend, for example, versus online may be less, but it’s your weekly painting session, favorite outdoor concert series, and love for travel that ultimately make you a more attractive match on online dating apps. Honor those passions and interests and hopefully, you’ll find someone to share them with.</p>
<p>Take time to also foster relationships with friends and family who can serve as an invaluable support network (and a great sounding board) for your online <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/6-quick-tips-to-maintain-your-mental-health-while-dating/" target="_blank">dating app adventure</a>.</p>
<h2>Be Open to The Excitement a New Opportunities Bring</h2>
<p>Like any new experience, be open to where the opportunity may take you, while putting your mental health first. Schedule time to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/managing-social-media-intake-without-quitting/" target="_blank">disconnect from technology</a> so you can emerge refreshed and ready to interact with new people with a stronger sense of self. And don’t lose sight of possibilities that still exist outside of technology.</p>
<p>Anything is possible — even love online!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Relationships are complex, and require a great amount of effort between two people, one or both of which may be working through mental health challenges. We recently asked Talkspace <a href="https://www.instagram.com/talkspace" target="_blank">Instagram followers</a> to share their burning questions about relationships, specifically in a mental health context.</p>
<p>Talkspace’s relationship expert, clinical psychologist Iris Reitzes, PhD, kindly lent her expertise to help answer your important questions.</p>
<p><span id="more-10424"></span></p>
<h2>Should you bring up your mental health journey at the beginning of a relationship?</h2>
<p>During the the first few meetings or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/dating-red-flags/" target="_blank">dates</a> with someone, our tendency is to size each other up in a shallow, almost stereotyped way. We tend to categorize people according to what we know is good or bad, both for us and in a societal sense. For example, are they tall, fit, educated, religious, or wealthy? This helps us feel secure initially that we’re moving in the right direction by letting this person in our lives. To this point, I would recommend withholding intimate information and details about ourselves, like our mental health journey, until we’ve spent more time with them.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons for this:</p>
<p>One, it’s relatively private information, and we need to trust that the person we share this info with is someone who will treat it with respect and delicacy.</p>
<p>Two, if we want to give the relationship a chance, we need to give the other person a chance to know us in a natural context. They need to get a truer sense of us as people by knowing the little things that make us special to them, like the way we laugh, or how smart or loving we are.</p>
<p>Our mental health history is a single piece in the complex puzzle that is our life. The more a potential partner gets to know us, the better they can appreciate our journey and its influence on who we are. This also makes their decision less about a single issue if they choose to stay in the relationship after you’ve had more these intense personal discussions.</p>
<p>However, before we make a commitment forever, it’s important not to hide critical information about ourselves like our mental health challenges. You don&#8217;t want to be marked as someone who is deceptive, and you don&#8217;t want to live with hiding heavy secrets from your life partner.</p>
<h2>Is it normal to become more anxious when I start a relationship? I feel like I become too “clingy” or insecure.</h2>
<p>Yes, it is normal to be <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/01/what-causes-social-anxiety/" target="_blank">anxious</a> at the beginning of the relationship. It’s even recommended to a certain extent since you should be focused and aware on how you present yourself.</p>
<p>However, this is very different from exposing that you are clingy or insecure. If you let your insecurity show, your chances of turning this relationship into something long term will decline automatically. Almost everyone is looking for someone who is independent enough to choose their partner by choice, not because of neediness.</p>
<p>Work to convince yourself through meditation, positive self-talk, or through therapy that you are worthwhile, and that the person you will date will gain a great deal by being with you. Also, convince yourself that if it doesn’t work out you’re still a catch, and that this person probably wasn’t right for you.</p>
<h2>Why is it so hard to let a relationship go, knowing your partner let it go a long time ago?</h2>
<p>The less we believe in ourselves, the more unable we are to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/relationship-closure-possible-necessary/" target="_blank">let go of past relationships</a>. In this scenario, we’ve convinced ourselves that this person is our salvation, or that she or he is the only person that we can enjoy our life with or love. The fear of being left with just ourselves is proof of how we sometimes over value another person&#8217;s presence in our lives. We might think that we’ll never be able to love anyone again in the same, intense way.</p>
<p>In reality we are clinging to a person who doesn’t want us as their partner, and this actually does a lot of harm to our self-image. If we continue to think this way, rest assured that things will only get worse. They will have less patience for us over time, and we will connect their worst thoughts about who we are to our self-worth.</p>
<p>Sometimes we need to treat behavior like this in the same way we treat someone who is addicted to substance or other analogs. In order to be weaned from an addiction you need to take steps that are extreme and total, like distancing and detaching yourself from this person physically (i.e. not working or living in the same area, not talking, writing, or texting them). Try this until you find it easier to live without their presence in your life, and without being offended by knowing someone doesn&#8217;t want you in the same way anymore.</p>
<h2>What are the best ways to avoid a “funk” after a dating rejection? I want to stop obsessing over it!</h2>
<p>Obsession stems from anxiety. This anxiety is a result of fear that you will never find someone who is worthwhile, and that you are not worth anything.</p>
<p>It’s fine to be sad after a relationship (no matter the duration) has ended. Let&#8217;s not be afraid of sadness. Although it isn’t pleasant, it’s sometimes an important step in order to arrive at your next relationship. And some sadness helps you find closure from the last relationship.</p>
<p>If you <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/how-to-stop-obsessive-thinking/" target="_blank">obsess</a> over rejection, you’re likely on a road to nowhere. Relationships can drain your energy, especially when the other person is not excited about what you have to offer. This is the time when you, and others in your support circle, need to remind you how wonderful you are. This helps you return you to your independent self, as long as the support remains somewhat objective.</p>
<p>Again, short-term therapy can help remind you of all the positive things you bring to others’ lives and also direct you to look for people who are a better fit in your life.</p>
<h2>Why do some choose to cut people out of their lives, rather than fix relationship problems?</h2>
<p>The short answer is because it’s so much easier. The fallacy is that if the current relationship doesn&#8217;t work out, the next one is just around the corner, and it can be so much better.</p>
<p>Yes, the next one is likely around the corner. But if we don’t learn how to fight for the one that we are in, then history will repeat itself.</p>
<p>Staying in a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/can-a-relationship-make-you-mentally-ill/" target="_blank">complicated relationship</a> demands that we will look in the mirror of the other person&#8217;s eyes, see our unflattering sides, and deal with our shortcomings. It demands that we deal with behaviors we don’t want to change, which can seem disturbing and insurmountable.</p>
<p>Changing ourselves in order to accommodate another person is not convenient, yet it can be an opportunity for growth. We can simply ask ourselves if we are givers or takers in this relationship. If we take more than we give, it might be a positive growth experience to compel ourselves to make necessary changes.</p>
<h2>We Hope This Helps Your Grow in Your Relationships!</h2>
<p>Thanks again to our Instagram followers for their excellent questions about relationships and mental health. It’s important to note that our individual challenges are unique, but we’re not alone in our experiences when it comes to these tough topics.</p>
<p>If you feel you could benefit from extra support in your relationship, as an individual or a couple, Talkspace therapists are available to guide you through these challenges.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve probably all experienced — and ignored — red flags while dating. It’s so easy to get swept up in the novelty and excitement of seeing someone new that we’re blind to the not-so-great things going on.</p>
<p>It’s one thing if you’re just looking for someone to casually hook up with — but if you want a real relationship, if you want things to get serious and take things to the next level, you need to be willing to take a step back, wipe the hearts out of your eyes, and get real.</p>
<p>Here are 8 red flags you should look out for if you’re trying to make something blossom into a serious relationship.</p>
<p><span id="more-10381"></span></p>
<h2>1. They’ll Only Hang Out With You in the Late Night Hours</h2>
<p>This is almost always a dead giveaway that the person is only interested in one thing: sex. The later those “you up?” texts roll in, the worse the situation is. If someone wants to be serious with you, they’ll want to hang out no matter what time of day it is&#8230;and booty calls will probably be minimal.</p>
<h2>2. You’re Catching Them in Lies</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re catching someone in lies time and time again — or even just once — you’ve got to stop and wonder how honest this person is. What else is this person lying about? If they&#8217;re lying about one thing, it&#8217;s likely they&#8217;re lying about another. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/relationships/" target="_blank">Relationships</a> are built on trust, and fibbing in the beginning of a relationship is certainly cause for concern.</p>
<h2>3. They’re Always on Their Phone Around You</h2>
<p>I get it — <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/why-reach-for-phone-constantly/" target="_blank">phone addiction</a> is alive and well. But someone who cares about you should be able to put their phone away and be present if they’re having one-on-one time with you. If they can’t give you their undivided attention for a short period of time while you’re hanging out, what does that say about them in the long run? It should be an extra-large red flag if they take forever to call or text you back, but when you’re with them, all they do is text or make calls. Rude!</p>
<h2>4. Extreme Jealousy From the Start</h2>
<p>Having someone feeling a little <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/relationship-jealousy-damaging-mental-health/" target="_blank">jealous</a> and protective of you can be flattering, but exhibiting extreme jealousy — especially very early on — can be alarming and a cause for concern. As time goes on and the person becomes more and more attached to you, will their jealousy issue become worse? Jealousy often leads to fights and can even be bad for your mental health, so you’ll want to proceed with caution.</p>
<h2>5. Constantly Bringing Up or Smack-talking Their Ex</h2>
<p>This is one of the most annoying and awkward red flags in my opinion. Sure, people go through rough relationships and may want to vent about them when the time is right for being vulnerable, but the constant bashing of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/09/the-post-breakup-guide-to-dealing-with-social-media-and-your-ex/" target="_blank">exes</a> or calling exes crazy reflects more poorly on the person doing the bashing. It makes you think — if and when things end with you and this person, what are they gonna tell their new partners about <i>you?</i></p>
<h2>6. Being Flaky</h2>
<p>Bailing on plans last minute is not cool — period. If someone can’t respect your time in the beginning of a relationship, how can you know if they ever will? Some people are flaky by nature, and if that’s something you can’t deal with, it’s not something you can make the other person “fix.” If you’re getting stood up without warning or notice, this person is not for you. Your partner should value and appreciate your time.</p>
<h2>7. Not Respecting Your Boundaries</h2>
<p>Everyone has <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/guide-setting-healthy-boundaries-relationships/" target="_blank">boundaries</a>, and boundaries are meant to be respected. A partner should never force you to do things that make you feel very uncomfortable — and should always ask before proceeding with something questionable. This is especially true if someone is not respecting your sexual boundaries or needs. Consent is crucial!</p>
<h2>8. Being in a “Secret” Relationship</h2>
<p>If it’s been a while and you feel like you’re in a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/12/what-ethical-non-monogamy-can-teach-us-about-healthy-relationships/" target="_blank">secret relationship</a>, it’s time to have a talk with your partner. They don’t have to be posting cute couple photos on Instagram everyday, but if they are hesitant about “making it Facebook official” that’s a red flag. Are they hiding you from somebody else they are seeing? Are they not ready to fully commit to you? It’s hard to avoid jumping to the worst case scenarios, so you should have an open conversation about this, voicing your concerns.</p>
<h2>Your Happiness and Mental Health Come First</h2>
<p>Now, this isn’t all to say that you should ditch someone as soon as they exhibit one of these red flags. After all, nobody’s perfect. Decide what are the most important factors are in a relationship to you, and decide what <i>your</i> deal breakers are.</p>
<p>Be aware of your partner’s behaviors, actions, and how they treat you. Look at the situation objectively, trying to put feelings aside. Yes, the heart wants what it wants, but we also need to be rational when it comes to forming a healthy relationship and staying mentally well — which should be our top priority!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sandy and Danny from <i>Grease</i> aren’t the only ones who’ve experienced getting friendly down in the sand on romantic summer nights. Something about summer love makes it unlike any other type of romance we experience.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons summer flings are so popular and <i>so</i> intense. Long walks on the beach, sharing ice cream cones, late night skinny dips, cuddling in bed with the air conditioner on full blast — what’s not to love? Not to mention, summer flings are <i>way</i> more exhilarating than those of lazy winter <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/when-is-cuffing-season-it-starts-in-november-but-heres-why-you-should-skip-it-according-to-experts-2777801" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">cuffing</a> season.</p>

<h2>Summer Fling Science, Explained</h2>
<p>To be honest, summer flings might just be one of my favorite things about summer — right up there with the smell of sunscreen on the beach. There’s nothing like the feeling of having a new crush. When you’re attracted to someone, your brain releases <a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/love-actually-science-behind-lust-attraction-companionship/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">feel good hormones</a> like dopamine and norepinephrine. You can thank these two chemicals for the happy, giddy feeling you get when you have a crush. The more time you’re spending with someone and the more you’re becoming attracted to them, the more dopamine and norepinephrine will be released.</p>
<p>Not to mention, <a href="http://time.com/4888327/why-sunlight-is-so-good-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the sun is so good for you</a>, physically and mentally. Sunshine and natural light make us feel great — it’s science! Studies show that there’s a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3779905/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">link between sunlight exposure and serotonin levels</a>. With the combination of all these feel-good hormones being released thanks to both your crush and the sun, it’s no wonder why summer flings feel absolutely amazing!</p>
<h2>How Summer Relaxation Leads to Flings</h2>
<p>Just as the summer months are breeding ground for sunburns and mosquito bites, they’re also breeding grounds for romance because we’re in a generally in a more relaxed and open state of mind. As they say, summertime and the livin’s easy!</p>
<p>“In general, individuals tend to have more relaxed school or work schedules in the summer and more time to connect with friends and acquaintances,” Talkspace clinical counselor Rachel O’Neil, Ph.D., explains. “Thus, new individuals can orbit into your life — like that friend of a friend of a friend that happens to be at the same party as you!” She adds, “Summer (and summer clothing!) may also bring about motivation to look your best — which may lead to more <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/5-ways-improve-body-image-confidence-mental-health/" target="_blank">self-confidence</a> which usually translates to feeling more sexy and self-assured!”</p>
<p>Cynthia V. Catchings, LCSW and Talkspace therapist agrees. “[Summer is] a time to escape from routine and open up to new people and experiences. Spending good time with another person increases attraction and invites people to engage in <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/guide-setting-healthy-boundaries-relationships/" target="_blank">relationships</a> with no strings attached,” she said, “Summer flings offer the opportunity to enjoy and have fun without the worries that sometimes come with long-term relationships.”</p>
<p>Bottom line: Summer flings are great for commitment-phobes looking to have fun and get to know somebody new.</p>
<h2>What to do When Summer Flings Become Serious</h2>
<p>In order to keep these flings healthy and to keep your heart safe, you have to manage expectations.</p>
<p>“Acknowledging that we are entering into a relationship that might not last long is what makes a difference,” Catchings advised. “A summer fling can be healthy, if we do not have expectations. As long as both individuals keep their perspective, it can be fun!”</p>
<p>But wait! What if you’ve fallen madly in love with your fling and don’t want it to end when the temperature cools down? The key — as it usually is when it comes to relationships — is <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/best-way-fight-partner-according-therapist/" target="_blank">communication</a>. Dropping hints and being extra lovey-dovey just isn’t going to cut it.</p>
<p>“Be clear about your expectations up front,” Rachel O’Neil cautioned, “If you’re looking for a longer-term relationship make sure you and your partner are on the same page. If there may be any barriers to maintaining your relationship past the summer (for example, returning to school in different states), you would want to be sure to be proactive and communicate about how you’ll handle those barriers.”</p>
<h2>No Matter What Happens, Enjoy Your Summer Experiences</h2>
<p>Whether or not your summer fling blossoms into something more serious, you can enjoy your time getting to know somebody new and enjoying all the fun date activities that summer has to offer — beach days, county fairs, campfires, whatever suits your fancy. I like to think summer flings enter your life to remind you that love exists, that romance is real, and that love (or something like it) at first sight is possible.</p>
<p>We can experience our most fun emotions during the most beautiful time of the year — and even if it has an expiration date, it was tasty while it lasted.</p>
