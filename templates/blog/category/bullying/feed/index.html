				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people wonder exactly what bullying is and what types of bullying there are. Bullying takes many different forms and can impact children and adults alike. From physical and verbal bullying to social and cyber bullying, this form of unwanted, aggressive behavior can be either obvious to spot or more subtle. It entails a person intentionally and repeatedly causing discomfort or injury to another individual without cause. Generally, a bullied person is unable to defend him or herself and is likely not in a position of power, according to the <a href="http://www.apa.org/topics/bullying/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">American Psychological Association</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-11364"></span></p>
<p>In order to prevent and mitigate <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/bullying/">bullying</a> when it occurs, it’s important to know the signs and types. It can happen in any number of places, contexts or locations, including online and via a cell phone. There are two broad <a href="https://www.stopbullying.gov/media/facts/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">modes of bullying</a>: Direct and indirect. Direct bullying occurs between the people involved in a situation, whereas indirect actions involve others, such as passing on insults or spreading rumors. Indirect bullying mostly inflicts harm by damaging another person’s social reputation, peer relationships and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/self-esteem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-esteem</a>.</p>
<h2>Types of Bullying Behavior</h2>
<p>Bullying entails a repeated, aggressive behavior over a period of time and is categorized in four primary ways: Physical, verbal, social, and cyber. Below you’ll find an in-depth view into each kind of bullying behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Physical bullying</b> is the most overt type of bullying behavior to spot and involves harming a person’s body or possessions. This may take the form of hitting, kicking, tripping, pinching, pushing or damaging another person’s property and can cause both short-term and long-term physical harm.</li>
<li><b>Verbal bullying</b> entails saying or writing mean words and includes name calling, insults, teasing, intimidation, inappropriate sexual comments, homophobic or racist remarks or verbal abuse. While verbal bullying behavior may start off harmlessly or in a joking context, it can escalate quickly, causing emotional distress.</li>
<li><b>Social bullying</b> is often harder to recognize, as it involves harming someone’s reputation or relationships. Sometimes referred to as relational bullying, this type of bullying behavior entails leaving someone out on purpose, telling people not to be friends with another person, spreading rumors and/or intentionally embarrassing someone in public.</li>
<li><b>Cyber bullying </b>can be overt or covert, as it entails bullying behaviors through digital technologies, such as computers and smartphones. Because of the nature of technology, this can happen at any time and can include abusive texts, emails, or social media posts, a deliberate exclusion of a person online, spreading rumors and imitating others by using their login information.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Effects of Bullying</h2>
<p>Bullying behavior impacts everyone involved and not just the targeted person, including those who bully and those who witness the action. While many reported instances of bullying impact children, adults are also susceptible to the harmful ripple effects of this behavior. It takes a toll on a person’s mental health and is linked to many negative <a href="https://www.stopbullying.gov/at-risk/effects/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">outcomes</a> including substance abuse, and in extreme cases, suicidal thoughts or feelings.</p>
<p>The physical and emotional <a href="https://www.medicaldaily.com/adult-bullying-what-you-need-know-and-how-it-affects-your-health-247107" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">effects</a> of bullying may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher risk for developing <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/">depression</a> and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/">anxiety</a></li>
<li>Increased and more frequent feelings of sadness and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/05/how-much-do-you-really-know-about-loneliness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loneliness</a></li>
<li>Changes in sleep patterns, including <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/the-surprising-new-connection-between-sleep-and-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insomnia</a> or exhaustion</li>
<li>Changes in eating patterns and appetite</li>
<li>Loss of interest and desire in activities</li>
<li>More health complaints, including a person’s physical well-being</li>
</ul>
<p>When it happens at work, a person’s ability to focus and ability to perform is impaired and can lead to a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/6-traits-toxic-people/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toxic environment</a> over the long term. Bullies may target individuals that pose a threat to them with the goal of making the individual feel less confident and more inadequate in the workplace. But even witnessing this type of bullying can have a harmful impact. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722445/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">One study</a> found that a bystander is at an increased risk of developing depressive symptoms over the subsequent 18 months after bullying occurs.</p>
<h2>What to Do if You are Bullied</h2>
<p>When a bullying behavior occurs, whether a person is the intended target or a bystander, there are actions that can be taken to help stop the behavior and prevent it in the future. Start by recording what is occurring, documenting the words or behaviors of the bully and describing when and where it took place. If it <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/7-ways-to-deal-with-cyberbullying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">occurred through email, text or social media</a>, print those instances for documentation purposes. This will ensure a thorough account of the incident(s) when you take action.</p>
<p>While anger, withdrawal and the fear of a stigma may lead a bullied person to suffer alone and in silence, it is important to report bullying behavior to make sure the pattern does not continue to harm those around you. Whenever possible, put distance between yourself and the bully while seeking support. Whether you confide in a close friend or family member, or seek professional health counseling, know that bullying has nothing to do with you and everything to do with them.</p>
<p>Bullying behavior is upsetting and can have a significant impact on a person&#8217;s short-term and long-term physical and emotional health. While it can take many forms, whether direct or indirect, or through physical, verbal, social and cyber behaviors, the harmful effects impact not just the person bullied, but for anyone who witnesses the action as well. If you are experiencing bullying, it’s important to document, report and seek support, remembering that you are not alone in your experience and help is available.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;<a href="http://pubx.co/wezWoU" target="_blank">An Open Letter to My Catcallers On My Way to Work</a>&#8221; originally appeared on <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/" target="_blank">Fairygodboss</a>, an online career community for women, by women.</em></p>
<p>Dear Catcallers On My Way to Work This Morning,</p>
<p>Like a stray hair that slinks down the skin of my back, I can feel your eyes. Like the Spanx under my skirt you strip away with your mind, your words suffocate me.</p>
<p>On my way to the office, I saunter through Manhattan’s Herald Square. It’s crawling with wide-eyed tourists, to whom you’re supposed to be passing flyers and ushering onto double-decker buses. You call me an, ahem, part of the female anatomy because I won’t smile for you. I grip my keys between my knuckles, and I flash you the finger.<span id="more-8542"></span></p>
<p>At <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/easy-lunch-ideas" target="_blank">lunch</a>, you take a break from jackhammering the sidewalk to <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/career-topics/sexual-harassment-definition" target="_blank">thrust your hips and hump thin air</a>. You swallow your dangling tongue to ask me where I’m heading. I cross the street. On a good day, you’ll say, “God bless,” and give up. But on most days, you’ll hurl more curse words at me for not entertaining your offer.</p>
<p>Sporting your gray suit that matches your gray hair, another one of you tells me that, if I let you take care of me, I&#8217;ll never have to work. With your briefcase in hand, you wave me over. I choose to pretend I don&#8217;t hear you.</p>
<p>It’s daylight savings now, and I seldom leave my desk before the night falls. But I can still see you, shrouded in darkness but illumined by the display of your phone. When you’re on foot, you follow me home some blocks before you grow <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/career-topics/bored-at-work" target="_blank">bored</a>. I’m not on the phone with anyone; I’m drowning out the details of your disgusting desires, hoping that my preoccupied negligence might deter you. When you stalk me by car, you roll down the window to whistle and whisper dirty nothings; you drive sluggishly at my pace. I snap a photo of your face, or your license plate, and I dial the police. Sometimes you show aggression but, ultimately, you dart or drive off.</p>
<p>One time, you snapped a photo up my skirt. I’m still not sure if I prefer that to the time you spit on me.</p>
<p>I used to want to ask you how you’d feel if someone treated your mother, sister, or daughter like a butcher does meat. I used to feel inclined to ask you why — what do you actually think you’ll accomplish? But I know you have little to no regard for my thoughts; and I know you wouldn’t know how to handle a woman who welcomed your advances anyway.</p>
<p>In fact, I used to be afraid of you. I used to take different routes to the office to avoid you, but evermore of you lurk around each corner. So I wouldn’t prove an amusing target, I used to plug headphones in my ears — with no music, so I could still hear you in case your words were threatening.</p>
<p>As a woman, I’m a dauntless protagonist of my own life but, as women, we&#8217;ve all been conditioned to fear the same horror stories. Horror stories in which you, catcaller, are cast as the lead antagonist. It’s because we boast an education system that fails to <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/tips-for-handling-bullies-at-work" target="_blank">discipline our bullies</a>, endorse a media landscape deficient in our voices but replete with those of our oppressors, and laud a <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/should-i-go-to-law-school" target="_blank">legal structure</a> perfused with patriarchy. Women, like me, are told to tolerate life as passive victims of traditions among boys who will be boys in a world beset by bigotry, exacerbated by the objectification of our bodies as weapons of war, global gendercide, sex trafficking, and the sheer notion that one of the most developed nations in the world chalks sexual assault up to “locker room talk.”</p>
<p>When conditioned fear couples with a dwindling hope for deliverance in a society that promotes an agenda that too often negates our own, women become perpetually paralyzed by the thralldom of “what if.” What if you actually do the things you say you want to do to my body? What if you do snatch me up in your truck on my walk home? For a lot of us, the politics of life with a vagina becomes the bane of our existence.</p>
<p>But I won’t allow it anymore. And the more you’ve hounded and humped, loitered and licked your lips, coaxed and cursed, the more I’ve unfortunately gotten used to it all as the norm, and the more I&#8217;ve realized how unafraid I am these days. The more I’ve realized, I’m not scared — you are.</p>
<p>You’re afraid that a woman, on her way to work, might just <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/independent-women-quotes" target="_blank">change the world</a> as we know it.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re afraid that a working woman, afforded a voice, might just shut you up one day — and not by flipping you the bird or calling the police but, rather, by rising to a position you wouldn&#8217;t dare disrespect.</p>
<p>So, I’m ready when you are. When you really think you’re ready to handle a real response to those catcalls, let’s talk. Until then, I’ve got a job to crush.</p>
<p>Unapologetically,</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I remember what I was wearing: A blue tank top with a picture of a peacock, jean short-shorts, and flip-flops. I remember the weather: High summer, sweet grass scenting the air and the sun just beginning its slow descent to the horizon. I was walking down a country road, lost in my thirteen-year-old daydreams, when suddenly —</p>
<p><em>Honk honk!</em></p>
<p>A car horn split the air with its grating clamor. A group of men in the car waved their hands and heads out the windows, hollering at me.</p>
<p>It felt like I jumped a mile. My body flooded with shock. Fear. Self-consciousness. The moment before, I was at ease in my space, my body, my summer daydreams. Now, my sense of peace was ripped away like a wax strip torn from the heart.<span id="more-6927"></span></p>
<p>That was the first time I was street harassed.</p>
<p>Do you remember the first time you were street harassed? Were you a little girl? A young woman setting off for college? Or has it happened so often you can’t even remember the start?</p>
<p>If you’re a woman, chances are you’ve experienced street harassment — and not just one time. In fact, some surveys show that as many as <a href="https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/news/street-harassment-statistics" target="_blank">85%</a> of women report experiencing incidences of harassment in public space — including behaviors like staring, sexual comments, whistling, and even groping — before the age of 17. That means almost all of us have been street harassed before we’re even licensed to drive.</p>
<p>Street harassment affects women from all backgrounds, races, classes, and sexualities, though it can have a particularly difficult impact on women of color and members of the LGBTQ community. And while men can experience street harassment too, they are often harassed for being perceived as LGBTQ or “feminine.”</p>
<p>For many of us, the very pervasiveness of street harassment normalizes it, making us feel that it is inevitable or that we must simply “grin and bear it.” For too long, popular culture and even people close to us have reiterated these negative messages by dismissing street harassment as a “compliment,” as “no big deal,” or even as something that we invite through the clothes we wear, how we look, or where we choose to walk.</p>
<p>But let’s make one thing clear: Street harassment is never our fault and is much more than a “minor inconvenience.” Street harassment is a <a href="http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/resources/statistics/statistics-academic-studies/" target="_blank">global public health epidemic</a>.</p>
<p>As women, many of us deal with the negative mental health impacts of street harassment on a daily basis. Yet because street harassment is normalized, we often often lack a<a href="https://themighty.com/2017/04/review-pros-cons-online-therapy-app-talkspace/" target="_blank">cknowledgment and support</a> to recover from this very real trauma.</p>
<p>A new spate of social science research seeks to change this. By studying and recognizing how street harassment harms women’s mental health, this research can give us the tools to understand and heal from experiences of harassment, as well as inspire social change.</p>
<p>When we’re street harassed, we may experience negative mental health effects like:</p>
<h2>Anxiety, Shame, and Depression</h2>
<p>Street harassment is a form of objectification, an experience where our sexualities, bodies, and gender identities are treated by others as objects separate from our whole selves. By making us self-conscious of our bodies and fearful for our safety, objectification can give us a <a href="http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/appsych/opus/issues/2016/spring/rooney" target="_blank">constant sense of anxiety</a>; can distract us from our work; and can even contribute to depression.</p>
<h2>A Sense of Decreased Connectedness and Trust in Our Community</h2>
<p>When men in our neighborhoods, communities, and cities fail to respect our safety and bodily integrity, and when even our friends and family dismiss our experiences of harassment, it becomes <a href="https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-9276-12-87" target="_blank">difficult to trust those around us</a>. This can make us feel isolated and exacerbate any negative mental health effects we might be experiencing.</p>
<h2>A Restriction of Our Mobility and Safety</h2>
<p>To avoid or escape from street harassment, we may change our walking routes, alter our daily habits, constrict our behavior and self-expression (like the way we dress), or even change jobs or move. This, in turn, can increase our stress levels and have a <a href="http://genprogress.org/voices/2015/11/25/41304/millennials-face-long-term-effects-from-street-harassment/" target="_blank">negative overall effect on our mental and physical health</a> and our ability to do the things we love.</p>
<p>These effects are real, they are never our fault, and we deserve to live in a society free of street harassment. So how can we stay healthy as we face this daily injustice?</p>
<p>While initiatives like <a href="https://www.ihollaback.org/" target="_blank">Hollaback!</a> and <a href="http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/" target="_blank">Stop Street Harassment</a> work to change the culture that enables street harassment, we can also give ourselves and each other the love and support we deserve to flourish despite the daily stress and trauma of sexism.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/7-self-care-tips-for-when-stress-affects-your-body/" target="_blank">Self-care</a> starts when we take street harassment seriously, when we acknowledge the validity of our own emotional responses, and when we give ourselves the time, space, and love to heal. Self-care after an incident of street harassment may look like turning up the music and dancing to our favorite song, writing an angry Facebook post or journal entry, talking to a friend we trust, or taking a bubble bath. In the long run, self care can include encouraging mental health with the help of a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-its-like-to-use-talkspace-text-therapy-app-2015-3" target="_blank">therapist</a>. It can take the form of joining a woman’s group or being part of movements to end street harassment.</p>
<p>I think about myself walking down that road at 13 — body confident, head full of dreams, wanting nothing more than the sunshine on my skin. After that first incident of street harassment, I never walked down a road so freely again. Like many of us, I learned to fear public spaces, learned to feel anxiety about my body and safety, and learned to close myself off in order to protect myself.</p>
<p>More than a decade later, I think of that confident young girl and — taking <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/the-depressing-truth-about-how-sexism-changes-us/" target="_blank">a cue from feminist Jessica Valenti</a> — I wonder: If she didn’t live in a world of constant harassment, if she could walk down any street with that childlike boldness, who would that girl have been?</p>
<p>Who would any of us have been?</p>
<p>It’s not fair that we should have to deal with ongoing trauma simply for being women or LGBTQ people. But by caring for ourselves and each other, we can flourish even in the face of daily harassment. By acknowledging the negative mental health impacts of street harassment, caring for ourselves and each other, and even joining movements to challenge street harassment, we can thrive today in order to build a better tomorrow.</p>
<p>Because we all, every single one of us, deserve to feel the sun on our skin without fear.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bullying isn&#8217;t new, but the way people go about it has changed. What was once reserved for the schoolyard now occurs at home or at work via social media. In fact, cyberbullying affects adults as much as children. A 2012 <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/pressreleases/2012/november/punched-from-the-screen---workplace-cyber-bullying.aspx" target="_blank">study</a> from the University of Nottingham and the University of Sheffield found that eight out of ten of the 320 adults surveyed across three different universities had been victims of cyberbullying in the last six months. About a quarter reported feeling humiliated, ignored, or being the subject of online gossip at least once a week.</p>
<p>Rude comments or bullying in general can make one feel hurt, sad, or angry, leading to feelings of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxiety</a>, or self-esteem issues. When the rude comments or bullying are online — when people are looking at social media at home or at work — it can be even worse because it is happening in a place where they should feel safe. It can happen when they are around people important to them such as their children.</p>
<p>The written word is sometimes worse than the spoken word due to its permanency, and it can feel impossible to escape bullying. People see the comments every time they return to a page. Unlike in-person bullying, the bullies who makes the rude comments online cannot see how their victims react. They may go further with their bullying then if they were actually able to see the victim’s physical reaction.<span id="more-6170"></span></p>
<p>Online groups are filled with hundreds if not thousands of people who all witness the rude comments. This can make the situation more hurtful than a few people hearing the rude comments in person.</p>
<p>So what can you do to handle cyberbullying and be polite online? Here are a few tips:</p>
<p><strong>1. Don&#8217;t retaliate and write a nasty post in response. </strong></p>
<p>It will only make the situation worse.</p>
<p><strong>2. Do not take the rude comments personally nor doubt your views or beliefs. </strong></p>
<p>The rude comments have little to do with you. They are more about the issues of the person making them.</p>
<p><strong>3. Do not reread the offending comments. </strong></p>
<p>This will only lead to obsession and further anger. Report the offending comments to a group moderator if possible.</p>
<p><strong>4. Understand that not everyone has your same beliefs or views. </strong></p>
<p>Be open to others&#8217; thoughts and opinions. Recognize that many people can be right. What seems like a rude comment at first glance might only be someone expressing a different opinion.</p>
<p><strong>5. Make a 30 second rule. </strong></p>
<p>After you’ve written something but before you post it, step away from the computer or phone for 30 seconds. When you come back, look at the message you wrote and ask yourself how you&#8217;d feel if someone wrote this to you.</p>
<p><strong>6. Take a technology break. </strong></p>
<p>Turn off your phone and computer for a night and enjoy doing something free from technology such as enjoying a nice meal, meditating, or taking a warm bath.</p>
<p><strong>7. Technology doesn’t have to make us victims or perpetrators of bullying. </strong></p>
<p>By being mindful and considerate, we can make our online experience better.</p>
<p>While bullying is nothing new and we all know that it’s changed, finding victims not only on the playground but where they are online, there are tactics to combat it. Raising awareness about the issue, defining it as unacceptable, and sticking up for those who are bullied are ways that we will hopefully curtail this growing problem.</p>
