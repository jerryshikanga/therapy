				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hollywood loves to depict group therapy a certain way: always held in a large, sunny, open room, like a church or a community center, with a ring of folding chairs. There&#8217;s always coffee. Someone will come in late, and be warmly welcomed — and then immediately lay all of their worries bare.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s what you expect going into your first group therapy session, you might be surprised.</p>
<p><span id="more-11329"></span></p>
<p>The Hollywood version more closely resembles an ultra-glam support group. The reality&#8217;s a little different, but perhaps even more meaningful to those who take part.</p>
<h2>What can I expect?</h2>
<p>Most groups include five to fifteen people, all struggling with similar concerns, like a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/eating-disorders-body-image/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eating disorders</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/01/what-causes-social-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social anxiety</a>, or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/addiction-mental-illness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">substance abuse</a>. Even though (most of the time) everyone will have a similar diagnosis, all group members have differing life experiences — making group therapy a fantastic way to hear new perspectives. It&#8217;s also effective: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4209079/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">studies show</a> that group cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression works extremely well.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll probably have one or two licensed facilitators. (Some studies indicate that <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/11/power.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">groups with two facilitators</a> have improved outcomes.) Their exact license will depend on your state and your group — they may be therapists, social workers, or psychologists. They&#8217;ll be guiding the conversation and encouraging you to talk openly.</p>
<p>Yes, talk openly. To strangers. About your feelings. It can be scary! And that&#8217;s okay — the other participants are probably anxious about speaking, too. But, in order to actualize the amazing benefits of group therapy, you&#8217;ll want to share your story.</p>
<h2>What are the benefits?</h2>
<p>Group therapy is often undertaken in conjunction with individual therapy, because it offers a number of unique benefits that are hard to achieve in a one-on-one session with a therapist. Benefits of group therapy include:</p>
<h3>1. Meeting other people with similar problems</h3>
<p>When you&#8217;re struggling with a mental health condition like <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/happens-brain-ptsd-flashback/">post-traumatic stress disorder</a> (PTSD) or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/what-is-crippling-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major depression</a>, it&#8217;s easy to believe you&#8217;re suffering alone, or that no one else could understand the struggle you&#8217;ve been through. But once you start group therapy, you&#8217;ll quickly find that&#8217;s not accurate.</p>
<p>Yes, you all have unique perspectives and backgrounds — but you&#8217;ll see that, in many ways, you share commonalities. <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/11/power.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">One study</a> by Stanford University&#8217;s Irvin Yalom even found that interacting with peers might help more than one-on-one sessions with a therapist.</p>
<h3>2. Sharing your own struggles in a therapeutic setting</h3>
<p>Verbalizing your feelings <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/06/070622090727.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reduces strong emotions</a> like pain, anger, and sadness. When you&#8217;re surrounded by people struggling with similar problems, expressing your feelings can lead to an outpouring of support. That kind of validation is essential.</p>
<p>When you speak up in group therapy, you&#8217;re learning about yourself. Sometimes, we don&#8217;t know we feel something until we say it out loud. Those self-revelations are one of the reasons talk therapy works so well: we learn about ourselves <i>through</i> verbalizing our issues. And in group therapy, when you&#8217;re surrounded by people with similar challenges, you&#8217;ll get instant support for your new realization.</p>
<h3>3. Learning to relate to strangers</h3>
<p>For people struggling with social anxiety, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depression</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/anger-emotions-run-life/">anger management</a>, or other intersocial or socially related mental illnesses, group therapy can be a godsend. Your facilitators will work hard to create a safe atmosphere — letting you ask other members questions about their experiences and giving you the freedom to share something about yourself that makes you anxious.</p>
<p>Group therapy is also a fantastic time to learn more about how you interact with people. Are you an over-apologizer? Do you cut people off mid-sentence? Or do you hang back from the conversation, terrified that your input is unwanted? Facilitators can help you sort through those emotions in the comfort of a patient and understanding group working toward similar goals.</p>
<h3>4. Finding insight into yourself and your actions</h3>
<p>None of us, unfortunately, can observe our own behavior. You think you&#8217;re exceedingly shy — but others read you as blunt. Or, you&#8217;ve been working really hard on being more personable…but haven&#8217;t realized you&#8217;ve crossed the line into &#8220;annoying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because facilitators work so hard to make group therapy a safe and welcoming spot, you have the rare opportunity to both learn about <i>and</i> improve yourself.</p>
<p>Going to your first <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/09/different-types-therapy-psychotherapy-best/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">group therapy</a> session may feel frightening. But you may find that group of strangers doesn&#8217;t feel lonely at all. In fact, opening up to strangers can help you come to important realizations about yourself and your mental health.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have taken the time to search for “therapist near me” — as many of us mental health warriors have at one time or another — you deserve a high five. Deciding to seek therapy can be scary and stressful at first, so taking that first step is commendable. Go, you!</p>
<p>However, after you’ve plugged the search term into your browser and received your “therapist near me” results, you are likely to be inundated with an overwhelming amount of data and therapist choices. You might be asking yourself which results are useful and which are not. How can you find the perfect therapist if you don’t quite know what you’re looking at?</p>
<p>Seeking therapy should be as stress-free as possible . We’ll point you in the right direction, and you’ll find a great therapist. Most importantly, you’ll have a clearer path forward toward wellness.</p>
<p><span id="more-11281"></span></p>
<h2>Deciphering Your Search Results</h2>
<p>After you search “therapist near me,” you will probably find that instead of getting actual names and websites of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">therapists</a> near you, you are getting websites that list different therapists (like Psychology Today, for example), websites of therapy clinics, articles about therapy, and other therapy services.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that most <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/08/the-different-types-of-therapists-and-counselors-the-complete-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">practicing therapists</a> don’t have their own websites. Or if they do, they don’t rank high enough in internet search results to be easily found. But that doesn’t mean that your “therapist near me” search results won’t be useful. You just have to know which websites to click over to, and how to evaluate the info you’re seeing.</p>
<h2>How To Find Online Lists of Therapy Practices Near You</h2>
<p>Most of us are looking for a therapist in private practice near our home or work who we can easily make an appointment with. Here’s how you can locate some of these therapy practices online.</p>
<ol>
<li>Search Professional Psychological Organizations</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the best ways to start is to browse the therapist listings provided by professional organizations. Many therapists have a “page” listed on these sites, with lists of their specialties and areas of interest. Organizations like <a href="https://www.nami.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">National Alliance on Mental Illness</a> (NAMI), <a href="https://www.apa.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">American Psychological Association</a> (APA), and the <a href="http://www.abct.org/Home/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies</a> are good places to start. Psychology Today, though not a professional organization per se, usually has a reliable list of nearby therapists to choose from.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Search Therapist Lists Provided By Your Insurance Company</li>
</ol>
<p>If your insurance provider covers therapists, you can get a list from them, or access a list online. Your choices might be limited, but it never hurts to call nearby therapists on the lists and ask about their availability. You can also “vet” them beforehand, doing an internet search on the therapist’s name to see if they have a website or a page on a professional organization’s website.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Online Therapy Sites</li>
</ol>
<p>If you search for “therapists near me,” you are likely to directed to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy">online therapy</a> sites. Online therapy delivers therapists as near as you can get: directly into your home! Therapy is usually done via online text messaging, video messaging, or live video sessions. Online therapy is rapidly growing in popularity because it fits easily into our busy lives, and<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4219070/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> has been shown to be as effective as one-to-one therapy</a>.</p>
<p>Online therapy sites like <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/">Talkspace</a> help match you with a well-qualified therapist that specializes in the issues that matter to you, and they don’t limit you to therapists within your geographical vicinity. You will be able to view the profiles of several recommended therapists before trying one out. In Talkspace’s case, the vetting is done for you, as they only select certified therapists who’ve gone through a rigorous credentialing, and training process. So, in essence, some of the “searching” is done <i>for</i> you — based on your needs and search criteria, of course.Talkspace also makes it easy to switch therapists if you find your first selection isn’t a perfect fit.</p>
<h2>Recommendations From Friends And Others</h2>
<p>Another great way to find a good therapist is to get a recommendation. This can get a little tricky if you are relying on family or friends for a recommendation. After all, you may not want to share the same therapist with someone close to you, and your loved ones may not have the same mental health needs as you do.</p>
<p>However, if there is someone in your life who you trust to give you advice, asking them about their current or previous therapists is not a bad place to start. That therapist might be able to recommend a colleague, or a local professional organization for you to search.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can look beyond your immediate friend and family circle for recommendations. Ask your primary care provider, a clergyperson, or a trusted member of your community who you may not have quite as close an interpersonal relationship with. If you are looking for a therapist for your child, you can seek advice from your child’s pediatrician, school counselor, or other parents in your community. Talkspace also now offers <a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/talkspace-for-teens">therapy for teens</a>.</p>
<h2>Narrowing Down Your Search/Specialties</h2>
<p>Once you have a list of possible nearby therapists to choose from, it’s time to narrow down your search, and find a therapist you can work with — hopefully for the long-haul. If you are doing an internet search for “therapists near me,” you might consider making your search more specific by adding some keywords that more accurately describe the type of therapist you are looking for.</p>
<p>For example, if you are battling <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/">anxiety</a> and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/">depression</a>, you can search for “anxiety/depression therapists near me.” If you have a psychological diagnosis already, you can add that keyword into your therapist search. If you are looking for a therapist that works within a certain modality, you can add that search term (“cognitive behavioral therapist,” for example).</p>
<p>You can also take note of any specialties that a therapist lists within their online profile. Many will tell you what their specialties and scope include. This can help you narrow down your search as well.</p>
<h2>“Trying Out” Your Therapist</h2>
<p>Once you have focused your search, you will likely have a few candidates to “meet,” either in person or online. Of course, you will first need to be sure that these therapists have room in their schedule for you, and that they have appointment times that work for you. You’ll also want to see if they accept your insurance, or offer payment plans that fit your budget.</p>
<p>This might require a phone call to the therapist’s office, which can feel intimidating. But a quick phone call like this is actually a good way to see how you “vibe” with a particular therapist.</p>
<p>In the case of online therapy like Talkspace, the time between <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/10/what-i-wish-someone-had-told-me-about-how-therapy-actually-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deciding to seek therapy</a> and talking to potential therapists is greatly reduced — from upwards of two weeks (or months if the therapist has a waitlist) to a matter of hours. This can be beneficial if you have a busy schedule, and the option to talk via text or video — whichever is most convenient for you— is just a click away.</p>
<p>It can be stressful the first time you touch base with a therapist, but remember most folks who have tried therapy felt nervous the first time. Therapy brings up a lot of emotions, and it is natural to feel especially vulnerable when you are opening yourself up in this way, especially if this is your first time.</p>
<h2>Your First Sessions</h2>
<p>Remember that the first few sessions with a new therapist are a time for you to “feel things out.” Your gut instinct about a particular therapist can be very powerful. You don’t want to rush to judgment if you don’t immediately hit it off with your therapist (sometimes difficult feelings are a sign that the therapy is working, actually).</p>
<p>At the same time, you also don’t want to stay in a therapy-patient relationship that is not right to you. There is a well matched therapist out there for everyone. If you find that your first few tries are not what you’d hoped they’d, don’t give up. Sometimes it can take tries runs before you find your perfect therapist. But the good news is that most people who enter therapy begin to feel better after as little as three weeks.</p>
<h2>The Road Ahead in Therapy</h2>
<p>Phew! You’ve finally found a therapist near you or online who you feel comfortable with and who you can see on a regular basis. Congrats! It really <i>was </i> worth taking the time to do a diligent and careful search, wasn’t it?</p>
<p>If you are not there yet, however – or if the therapist that you were working with does not seem like a good match – don’t despair. Finding a therapist near you might sound daunting at first, but there are so many resources to help you. Remember: just taking the time to look is a wonderful gesture of self-care that will pay off in a big way before you know it. People even report feeling better just having made an appointment to see a therapist.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you have choices. You may find that there are no therapists near you that are quite what you are looking for. Many therapists these days offer telemedicine services like online therapy, so that is something to consider. You can also sign up for an online therapy company like Talkspace that you helps you find the right match and offers more flexible options for checking in with your therapist or scheduling video sessions.</p>
<p>Your mental health and wellness is worth it. In the end, having a regular therapist should not be an added stress. Remember to keep looking until you find a therapist that suits your needs <i>and</i> fits into your life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Often in therapy, clients come in prepared to discuss a single issue, and one that’s relatively minor in their eyes. However, it can quickly become evident they are struggling with severe mental health issues they likely aren’t aware of.</p>
<p>Relatedly, people may come in with a family member or partner who urges them to get help for a specific issue, but the client is defensive about the very idea of having this issue.</p>
<p>To better assist those we feel should seek help for mental illness, it helps to understand common examples where the potential client may not understand our concern for them.</p>
<p><span id="more-11082"></span></p>
<h2>How to Tell if Someone is Avoiding a Mental Health Crisis</h2>
<p>Here are a few examples of behavior that indicates potential mental illness, and how the party you’d like to get help for hides behind <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/identifying-avoidant-partner-improve-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">avoidance</a> or other negative behaviors.</p>
<h3>Scenario One: Projection</h3>
<p>A wife brings her husband in to counseling to discuss his nightly drinking. He becomes angry and tells her that the real problem is how miserable she makes him. Over the course of couples counseling, it becomes obvious to the therapist that the husband’s drinking meets criteria for <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/alcohol-abuse-signs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alcohol dependence</a>, but he evades any discussion of this, reiterating that if he was happy in his marriage, he wouldn’t need to relax with a drink.</p>
<h3>Scenario Two: Avoidance</h3>
<p>A mother brings in a 25 year old son who hasn’t moved out. She says that he lays around all day and doesn’t work or have friends. She says this is likely an extension of his <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/childhood-experience-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">childhood depression</a>. The son agrees to individual therapy but spends his time deflecting any discussion of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depression</a> and talking about his idea for a small business, which has not come to fruition since graduating college.</p>
<h3>Scenario Three: Past Trauma</h3>
<p>A woman comes in to counseling to get some <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/parenting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parenting</a> coaching. It becomes obvious that she has not processed trauma related to being <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/7-self-care-tips-for-sexual-assault-survivors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexually abused</a> as a child, and therefore she is hypervigilant to the possibility of her child being molested. This obsession occupies all of her thoughts but she gets angry when the therapist suggests that it might be related to her own experiences.</p>
<h2>How a Therapist Approaches These Scenarios</h2>
<p>In all of these situations, it is imperative that the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">therapist</a> meets the client where they are at. Trying to force the issue or challenging someone to move too quickly outside of their comfort zone is counterproductive.</p>
<p>The worst case scenario is that someone who very much needs help feels betrayed and attacked by their therapist and terminates <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">therapy</a> prematurely. Then the client is left with the exact same issues, but no support system and an even lower likelihood of opening up to another therapist to address the issues in the future.</p>
<p>Instead, a skilled therapist will gradually lower the client’s defenses as the therapist-client relationship deepens and grows over time. While session one may be the worst time for a client to hear that they sound depressed, session 10 or even 20 may provide just the right moment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is important for a therapist to provide a positive and genuine reason, that resonates with the client’s own values, for the client to do the hard and scary work of looking objectively at their own issues.</p>
<h2>Re-Examining Our Examples to Find Solutions</h2>
<p>It may be that the husband in the first example doesn’t want to be an alcoholic like his own father was. Perhaps if he opens up about his relationship with his dad, then he will find the motivation to try to be a better dad for his own son.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old son who is struggling with “failure to launch” issues may need the therapist to validate and brainstorm his business ideas, taking him seriously as a potentially high-achieving member of society, before he can delve into his struggles with depression.</p>
<p>And the woman in the last example would do anything to protect her daughter; over time, she may be gently convinced that working on her own trauma would in fact give her daughter a more present, and less anxious, mother.</p>
<h2>What to do if These Scenarios Sound Familiar</h2>
<p>If there is someone in your life who struggles with “owning” their mental health issues, encourage them to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/09/therapy-helps-recover-childhood-trauma-abuse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seek counseling</a>…even if it isn’t for the “reason” that you would prefer. Even if they initially go just to complain about you, they will still be getting in the door and starting to develop a relationship with a therapist.</p>
<p>Over time, this may blossom into a relationship that gives your loved one a safe space to open up and tackle issues that make them uncomfortable and ashamed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Therapists provide an incredibly valuable service: helping others work through issues and roadblocks, leading them toward more positive mental health and life experiences.</p>
<p>It’s almost superhuman how therapists work with their clients on such a deep level, while maintaining their energy at home, in their own personal lives, and confronting their own challenges.</p>
<p>We recently asked Talkspace therapists a few questions about how they support their own mental health and wellness. Did you know that therapists also seek therapy and counseling? Their answers, and more insight into the lives of therapists, are below.</p>
<p><span id="more-10516"></span></p>
<h2>How do you personally preserve your mental health, considering you help others do the same on a daily basis?</h2>
<p>“I’ve been a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a> for going on 25 years and know that maintaining my own mental health and practicing self care is vital, personally and professionally. Given the intensity of the work we do as therapists — being present for the pain, suffering, trauma, and despair of others, while actively working to help them — means that taking care of oneself is crucial in order to be present for my clients.</p>
<p>Just like on an airplane, you need to put your oxygen mask on first before assisting others.”</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Jill E Daino, LCSW (New York), Talkspace Therapist</em></p>
<p>“A quote by Dr. Sigmund Freud inevitably comes to mind, “no one who, like me, conjures up the most evil of those half-tamed demons that inhabit the human beast, and seeks to wrestle with them, can expect to come through the struggle unscathed.” After hearing that for the first time, I make sure to dedicate enough time to safeguard my mental health, with the goal of offering better services to my clients and surviving in a fast-paced profession.”</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Cynthia Catchings, LCSW-S (Virginia), Talkspace Therapist</em></p>
<p>“When I’m seeing clients, I make sure to take 5-minute “<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/mindfulness-therapy-improve-mental-health/" target="_blank">mindfulness</a>” breaks throughout my workday to make sure that I’m fully focused and present in my work with clients. I try it have a set “off” time each day—where I’m done responding to emails and doing anything work related.”</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Rachel O’Neill, Ph.D., LPCC-S (Ohio), Talkspace Therapist</em></p>
<h2>What does self-care look like for you as a therapist?</h2>
<p>“The years of being in supervision groups, personal therapy, and having trusted colleagues to openly discuss the impact the work has been invaluable. Without the ability to process what we hear, the pain and suffering of others sits within us and can be experienced as its own form of traumatization — or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/caregivers-can-avoid-burnout-stay-mentally-healthy/" target="_blank">compassion fatigue</a> as it is sometimes referred to in the literature.”</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Jill E Daino, LCSW</em></p>
<p>“One thing that I try to make my own is that my <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/7-self-care-tips-for-when-stress-affects-your-body/" target="_blank">list of self-care activities</a> is unique to my needs, interests, and likes. These activities include things that bring me pleasure and replenish me. If an activity encompass learning, traveling, and spirituality, it’s perfect for me.</p>
<p>Another important part of my self-care is my own personal therapeutic process. A therapist in therapy is most of the time a great therapist.”</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Cynthia Catchings, LCSW-S</em></p>
<p>“I work to engage in positive health self-care at least once a day. A few days a week, I go for a run. I spend quality time with my spouse and children. I read books that are not related to counseling at least occasionally. I also <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/08/why-working-with-a-therapist-is-different-than-talking-to-a-friend/" target="_blank">see a therapist</a> of my own every couple of months as a check in.”</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Christine Tolman, LPC</em></p>
<p><a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/online-therapy-with-a-licensed-therapist?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_MID&amp;utr_adgroup=midpost-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=3061&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/therapy-helped-me-forgive-my-mom/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4880 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png" alt="affordable blog purchase CTA" width="660" height="240" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png 660w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a></p>
<h2>How do you set boundaries between your work and your personal life, considering the weight of the subject matter in daily practice?</h2>
<p>“All therapists, including myself, have our particular credentialing field’s Code of Ethics. This Code of Ethics specifies that when we get licensed, we will be monitoring our own physical, psychological, social, and spiritual well-being when engaging with clients. If we want to provide our clients with the best possible sessions, we must be at our best, and to do that, we need to take care of ourselves.”</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Cynthia Catchings, LCSW-S</em></p>
<p>“I am very mindful about what I share with clients. If I feel it will help them, I will share a story from my personal life. If I am sharing because of a personal internal need, I check myself and do not share that information.”</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Christine Tolman, LPC</em></p>
<p>“I make sure that I have an off button. I care deeply about my clients — both past and present — but I also need to be able to leave my work at work. I try to have a bridge between home and work. Whether I’m working in my office or my home office, I try to take a few minutes at the end of each day to tie up any loose ends, review my <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/time-management-mental-health/" target="_blank">to-do list</a> for the next day, and give myself just a few minutes of breathing room before I transition into my other roles (wife, mother, friend).”</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Rachel O’Neill, Ph.D., LPCC-S</em></p>
<h2>What’s something beneficial you’ve learned in your practice with others that you now carry into your personal life?</h2>
<p>“One of the most helpful things that has been also beneficial in my own life is the use of small mindfulness practices. And given the availability of easy to use apps now, it’s that much more accessible for most people.”</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Jill E Daino, LCSW</em></p>
<p>“I have learned to be more compassionate and thoughtful in my experiences with strangers. Often the way you treat others says more about yourself than the other person, so I try not to personalize it when someone is not kind to me. I have also learned that almost everyone has insecurities of some kind, and it is not healthy to dwell on them. As a result, I feel more confident in my own abilities.”</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Christine Tolman, LPC</em></p>
<p>“I’ve learned that my clients are resilient. In order to be helpful to them, I need to be sure to incorporate <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/7-secrets-of-highly-resilient-people/" target="_blank">resiliency</a>, wellness, and self-care into my own life. It’s a little cliche, but I find it helpful to remind myself that self-care isn’t selfish. It’s okay to set boundaries. It’s okay to say no and It’s okay to have an off button.”</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Rachel O’Neill, Ph.D., LPCC-S</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s common for therapists to talk about “reframing” something. But what does that even mean?</p>
<p>The therapist focus on cognitive reframing is something you’ve likely encountered if you’ve been in therapy before. If you haven’t, the concept might sound a bit strange at first, but I assure you it does make a lot of sense.</p>
<p><span id="more-10342"></span></p>
<h2>Reframing Explained</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">Therapy</a>, at its core, is often about uncovering issues and problem solving. Of course, no one would want to attend therapy if they didn&#8217;t think that it would help them better tackle their problems, whether that means working through a problematic relationship, grieving the loss of a loved one, or finding new ways to manage <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a> or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxiety</a> symptoms.</p>
<p>Understanding a problem is the crux of the work in therapy spaces. How would you expect to “fix” (or correct) a problem if you’re not entirely sure what the problem is? Sometimes problems can be external (“My boyfriend cheated on me!”) or more internal (“I should be farther along in my life by now!”). Sometimes these problems come as a shock to us and are unavoidable. After all, many (if not all) of us experience concerns about our relationships, or worries about our path in life at some point. The problem could, in part, be a matter of perspective.</p>
<h2>Why a Shift in Perspective is Important for Personal Progress</h2>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a>, I find that some of the most valuable experiences in therapy come when you experience a shift in perspective. Being able to see a situation from a different point of view can help you feel better and uncover new ways to manage a problem or situation. Simply put, sometimes we can’t see the forest for the trees. And often, seeing that broader picture can help us tremendously. This is what reframing is.</p>
<p><strong>Reframing, in the therapeutic sense, is about looking at a situation, thought, or feeling from another angle</strong>. Therapists are really good at this because our goal is to be supportive and empathetic to you and your concerns, but also help you work through issues. When we take on your challenges, whatever they may be, and offer another perspective, we are “reframing.”</p>
<p>We are hoping to help you adjust your perspective or thought pattern based on a reaction from you that is largely driven by emotion. The emotions that you feel, or thoughts that you think, are often rooted in old patterns that no longer serve you. By reframing a situation, or taking on a new perspective, you can help adjust those patterns (and break them over time) leaving you feeling healthier and more in control of your own mind.</p>
<h2>An Example of Reframing in Practice</h2>
<p>Consider an example: Let’s say that you are a 20-something who has finished college and now entering the workforce. You’ve done well in school, but always found yourself competing with your peers. That competition has bred a little bit of anxiety about achievement. You’ve done well for yourself and landed a decent job with fair pay that comes with a lot of responsibility. You feel a great sense of duty to meet quick deadlines, which brings up old anxieties about comparison and achievement.</p>
<p>When you get your first performance review, you get the feedback that you could “<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/time-management-mental-health/" target="_blank">manage your time more efficiently</a>” without much other feedback. This sends you in a bit of a tailspin. You now fear that your boss is looking for a reason to get rid of you. You try to do every task very quickly. You make more mistakes because you’re anxious and rush through projects. You’re afraid to lose your job. The anxiety is causing you to perform worse and you’re not sure what to do about it.</p>
<p>What if you reframed that feedback from your boss? What if your boss meant that she doesn’t like that you often stay late after hours and wants you to take better care of yourself on a daily basis? What if she sees your work as being thorough and efficient, but is scared you’re going to burn yourself out and end up hating your career path?</p>
<p>Any of those perspectives may or may not be true, but what we <i>do</i> know is that if you can interrupt the anxiety and fear that your job is in jeopardy, you’re likely going to perform much better — both with the content of your work and the management of your time. Reframing may just be the key to freeing you from an anxious spiral of thoughts that may or may not be true. Even just stopping the momentum of those moments could be <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/how-staying-in-a-job-you-hate-affects-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">career-saving</a> and incredibly positive for your mental health.</p>
<h2>Reframing is a Single Tool in the Broad Therapy Kit</h2>
<p>As you can see, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/stronger-the-broken-places/201712/reframing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reframing</a> is one tool that you can use to challenge assumptions and automatic thoughts that come up for you. When we can make regular use of tools that help challenge these assumptions, we put ourselves in a much healthier mindset. And, ultimately, this leads to a great positive shift in your quality of life.</p>
<p>The next time you start to feel anxious, depressed, or overwhelmed try to reframe the situation and look at it from a slightly different angle. If you do, you’ll likely end up in a much better place emotionally. And if you’d like to have help working on this (as it can be hard to do alone) <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_POST_INLINE&amp;utr_adgroup=reframing-is-therapys-most-effective-tool-heres-why?utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/reframing-therapy-effective-tool/" target="_blank">try working with a therapist</a> for extra support and guidance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Father’s Day is great time to celebrate the similarities that make us family, and differences that make us individuals. As kids, we looked to dad for strength and guidance in the face of life’s adversities. But who looked out for them?</p>
<p>For some fathers, stigma and toxic masculinity may have held them back from healing they desperately needed. In the United States, <a href="http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/infographic-mental-health-men" target="blank" rel="nofollow">6 million men suffer from depression</a>. Men die by suicide over <a href="https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/" target="blank" rel="nofollow">3.5 times more</a> than women. Yet only <a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/2015/12/numbers.aspx" target="blank" rel="nofollow">one in four seek help</a> from a mental health professional.</p>
<p>The conversation is shifting, however, as mental health has been a highly discussed topic in 2018. The hope is that by addressing generational stigma around mental health, we can encourage men to seek the help they need. We asked our male therapists and coworkers how they view mental health differently than their fathers. Here’s what they had to say.</p>
<p><span id="more-10114"></span></p>
<h2>How Our Views Differ From Our Fathers</h2>
<h3>Ability to Have the Conversation</h3>
<p>“My level of comfort when talking about difficult personal issues is higher than my father’s, and I understand why. For men of his generation, talking about mental health issues was taboo and seen as a weakness. Now, discussions on depression, anxiety, and stress are conversations I am comfortable having with family and close friends. Younger generations should continue to shed stigmas that prevent our wellbeing as a modern society.”</p>
<p><i>Dr. Neil Leibowitz, Chief Medical Officer at Talkspace, New York</i></p>
<h3>Dad&#8217;s Reluctant Support Helped Me Become a Therapist</h3>
<p>“I was one of the first men in my family not to work with my hands or serve in the military. My dad had to adjust to the idea of me being a psychotherapist, as, in comparison, it wasn’t considered as honorable a profession . When I had problems in young adulthood, he didn’t believe [therapy] would help me either, but he certainly paid for me to go. It turns out it profoundly impacted me, to the point that I decided to pursue it as my career. We see eye-to-eye on it now, and it’s great to know that he values my profession. Happy Father’s Day, Dad!”</p>
<p><i>Jacob Slagle, LMFT, Talkspace Therapist, Oklahoma</i></p>
<h3>Being Willing to Acknowledge the Issue</h3>
<p>“My father understood mental health issues existed, but avoided acknowledging them directly, suppressed them, and believed they could be eliminated through willpower alone. He had little insight into his own emotional and mental landscape.</p>
<p>In contrast I believe the path to mental health improvement is relational, and also takes a willingness to acknowledge and, on an ongoing basis, mindfully bear witness to one&#8217;s thoughts and feeling states, however uncomfortable.”</p>
<p><i>Chris, Talkspace </i></p>
<h3>Manning Up vs. Getting it Out</h3>
<p>&#8220;My father never saw mental health as a problem per se. He believed that all you had to do is ‘man up’ and just brush it off. He also did not feel talking about his emotions would help make anything better. I see it as a process. Emotions cannot last forever but our thoughts about those emotions need to be talked out. Being able to hear ourselves talk about our issues and emotions can help us better understand them, get a second point of view from a person with no other vested interest (usually a therapist), and not just let that unprocessed thought remain in our head.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Steve Bisson, LMHC, Talkspace Therapist, Massachusetts</i></p>
<h3>Combining Physical and Mental Health</h3>
<p>“My views on mental health differ from my father because he believes that with good diet and exercise and a moderate stress level, mental health just kind of falls into place. I, on the other hand, think it’s more something you need to actively work on, and all those things help, but certainly aren’t the cure. I think a lot of males in my generation are realizing that, and as a result are more in touch with their emotions.”</p>
<p><i>Alex, Talkspace</i></p>
<h3>Being Acceptant of Vulnerability</h3>
<p>“My father didn’t acknowledge mental health. He didn’t show emotion. He expected everyone to just deal or it was a sign of weakness. So I learned later that it is ok to express feelings and share and be vulnerable…”</p>
<p><i>Scott Christnelly, LCSW-R, Talkspace Therapist, New York</i></p>
<h3>Availability of Mental Health Information</h3>
<p>“In general, I believe access to mental health-related information, solutions, and dwindling exposure to stigmas are key differences between the two generations.</p>
<p>My father — and most of my extended family — primarily rely on their faith to carry them through difficult times. Having studied psychology, my approach to personal issues is more scientific and methodological. At first, conversations about mental health were non-existent, but I believe my openness with my own challenges has opened the door. Although, as a parent, I’m sure it’s tough to know these challenges are a part of your child’s daily life. We still learn from our parents, but there’s a lot they can learn from us.”</p>
<p><i>Josh, Talkspace</i></p>
<h3>Guiding Me as a Therapist</h3>
<p>“I believe my father’s use of common sense and reason has impacted my therapeutic style; much of what we do can simply be considered common sense and reason.”</p>
<p><i>Mark Ziegenbein LIMHP, Talkspace Therapist, Nebraska</i></p>
<h2>Check In On Dad This Father’s Day</h2>
<p>Father’s Day is a time to show appreciation for all our dads have done.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My boyfriend and I lay in bed, his fingers twirling my chest hair as we talked about our plans for hysterectomies. I told him I saw the procedure as a safeguard against a worst case scenario. Hearing this, he looked so anguished, I nearly felt guilty.</p>
<p>“It makes me sad that you worry about that happening again” he said.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I told my 12-step sponsor about surviving sexual assault. He said we can’t resolve some experiences, we can only share our stories to help others realize they’re not alone. In other words, we can say, “me, too.”</p>
<p>Since getting sober in 2013, I’ve heard stories from several sexual assault survivors and I’ve told my own. Men don’t often discuss sexual assault or mental health, and while it’s not easy to share my story, I believe it’s crucial.</p>
<p><span id="more-10108"></span></p>
<h2>My Story</h2>
<p>It happened a few months before I got sober.</p>
<p>He was an acquaintance, and like all of my acquaintances at the time, our relationship was defined by our mutual affinity for substance use. I was 21 and he was about 15 years older. He was stocky, blond, and clean-shaven. I never knew his last name.</p>
<p>One afternoon, we sat together under a bridge. Although I hadn’t found him attractive, as the rush of euphoria overtook my senses, I stared into his eyes and felt profound joy and affection. I kissed him. He kissed me back.</p>
<p>By nightfall, he had found a bottle of whiskey. Though I didn’t need encouragement, he urged me to keep drinking.</p>
<p>The next thing I recall, I was pressed up against a parked car in the dark. After another memory gap, we were atop the air mattress in my sparsely-furnished bedroom. The ceiling spun above him and I only remember thinking, “I can’t wait for this to be over.”</p>
<p>Maybe the gaps in my memory are for the better. But they’re frustrating because some stubborn part of me believes if I can determine exactly what happened, then I can prevent it from happening again.</p>
<h2>Reliving the Trauma</h2>
<p>A week later, I told — and believed — my <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/08/the-different-types-of-therapists-and-counselors-the-complete-guide/">therapist</a> it was another bad hook-up. Then, I told my acquaintance I didn’t want to do that again.</p>
<p>His reply felt like a knife to my throat.</p>
<p>“Don’t go accusing me of rape,” he said.</p>
<p>I didn’t. Not in our conversation and not afterward. But he soon left town, after gifting me a romantic letter and a bracelet, too feminine for my taste. Though I’d come out as a trans man, most people in my life disregarded this and treated me as a woman.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, I completely forgot what happened. I didn’t remember until I’d been sober for over six months.</p>
<p>In the meantime, my mind latched onto desperate attempts to prevent another assault. Consumed with paranoia, I berated my housemates about keeping the doors locked. While a buddy and I watched a horror movie with a rape scene, I felt suddenly nauseous without knowing why. Since trans people risk violence in gendered spaces, I avoided public restrooms at any cost. While driving, I accidentally hit a parking curb which threw me into a panic attack. One night, I jolted awake after a vividly terrifying nightmare involving sleep paralysis and a man directly behind me, undeterred by my knife.</p>
<p>After enduring something so intimately <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/7-tips-for-dating-a-survivor-sexual-abuse-assault/" target="_blank">traumatic</a>, misunderstood and deeply ingrained within society, nearly everyone seems to blame themselves. As I worked through my post-assault responses and feelings, I began to realize how self-blame can emerge in ways more complex than simply believing it was my fault.</p>
<p>Months later, I read a postcard on PostSecret: “I’m not sure if it was rape.”</p>
<p>“If you’re unsure, it probably was,” I thought. Then I remembered everything.</p>
<p>Until then, I’d clung onto a narrow idea of what defines a rape survivor. I’d believed survivors experience debilitating trauma, explicitly blaming themselves, and suffering from PTSD flashbacks like combat veterans. That wasn’t my experience, so how could I be a survivor?</p>
<h2>Opening Up to Seek Help</h2>
<p>After realizing I’d been raped, I shared my experience in a 12-step meeting. Another member kindly recommended talking to a therapist. My previous therapist had closed her practice, so I made an appointment at the community mental health agency. The new therapist listened empathetically, but I wasn’t sure what to tell him. While I occasionally felt justifiably angry at the man who raped me, my thoughts usually lingered on it without <i>feeling</i> anything.</p>
<p>Later, I realized that I felt a sort of commonality with my assailant. Though not as violently, I’d certainly harmed others with my actions. His was a crime of power but, like my own misdeeds, it was also a crime of opportunity. After this realization, my anger lessened. His actions weren’t remotely acceptable, but indulging my fantasies of revenge only fueled my own misery.</p>
<p>My heart raced with anxiety when my sponsor made the same point. He said, “If you cling onto that resentment, you’re getting raped again.”</p>
<p>That’s a harsh statement which my brain initially took literally, revving into fight or flight mode. But he meant I was only reliving it by holding onto my anger.</p>
<p>That was in 2014. Since then, I’ve utilized what I’ve learned in 12-step meetings to cope with the lingering effects of surviving <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/male-survivors-of-sexual-assault-face-unique-challenges-to-recovery/" target="_blank">sexual assault</a>. Many of these skills are the same ones I’ve learned from therapists: talking or writing about it, meditating, and finding ways to help others. Men aren’t expected to talk about this, but in my experience, many people are willing to listen.</p>
<h2>It’s Not Your Fault</h2>
<p>Recovering from sexual assault is a slow process, but it’s happening. I used to think about it every day, as soon as I woke up. Now, I realize it’s been several days since it’s crossed my mind.</p>
<p>Reflecting back, I realize how my obsessive attempts to prevent another assault were my way of blaming myself. In some ways, it’s easier to blame ourselves because then we could prevent it from happening again. It’s hard to acknowledge the reality that someone else was solely responsible. But it’s also a relief, because I can accept that it wasn’t my fault.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some years are better than others. Some of the “others” you’ll never forget because they change the course of your life <i>forever</i>. Last year was that year for me, and I’m still paying the price for it.</p>
<p>The year started off hopeful, but quickly dissolved into worry as I dealt with some physical health issues that required tests, follow-ups, and more appointments. As soon as that issue seemed to be under control, my depression, anxiety and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/how-to-stop-obsessive-thinking/" target="_blank">OCD</a> — all of which I’ve battled for half of my life — flared to levels I’d never experienced. Many days I could hardly get out bed, and I had a general sense of doom.</p>
<p><span id="more-10099"></span></p>
<p>On top of all this, my business was in transition and — apparently — so was my relationship. In August of last year, after five months of couples counseling, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/living-with-partner-after-breakup-bad-for-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">my partner of nine years and I split.</a></p>
<p>It seemed like every aspect of my life had been hit: physical, mental, personal, and professional. Nothing felt safe and I felt unstable to say the least.</p>
<p>Though my relationship had ended, I kept our therapist and started seeing her individually which helped me keep it together. Here’s how therapy got me through the worst year of my life.</p>
<h2>Therapy as a Routine</h2>
<p>Last year every part of my life was in flux. My relationship, which provided so much safety and security, had dissolved. My <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/ways-anxiety-impacts-your-physical-health/" target="_blank">physical health was uncertain</a> and my mental health was precarious at best. Any sense of routine or stability I had vanished.</p>
<p>The good news was that I could rely on therapy. Every Wednesday at 4 p.m., I knew I had just short of an hour to try to get my life back on track. Having that dedicated time and space — and more importantly, stability, played an important role in my life when everything else was so uncertain and unknown.</p>
<h2>An Unbiased Perspective</h2>
<p>I love my family and friends. I’m sure you do too. But let’s face it: They’re not always the best people to go to when you need advice. You know, the advice you need when making life-changing, future-altering decisions which will affect more people than just yourself.</p>
<p>Having a therapist who was <i>not</i> a friend or family, giving me advice from a third-party perspective, was much-needed. She didn’t have an agenda. She wasn’t biased. She was able to look at the situations that occured and give me her impartial perspective.</p>
<h2>New Ways of Thinking</h2>
<p>A great thing about having a dedicated therapist is they get to know you and how you operate. You also get to understand some of your thought patterns and behaviors.</p>
<p>For example, through therapy I realized just how negative my self-talk could be. I could understand how obsessive my thinking could be and how anxiety clouded everything. My therapist offered me new pathways of thinking and novel solutions.</p>
<p>Sometimes I actually say out loud, “Wow, I would have never thought that.” And I mean it. We’ve been conditioned in certain ways, and have particular mental health histories that can make it hard to deviate from what we’re used to. Instead of being on a one-way street with my thinking, my therapist offered several roads to consider. Ones that I would never have seen on my own.</p>
<h2>Learning About Myself</h2>
<p>I’m a fairly intuitive person and tend to overthink and analyze a lot. But sometimes when you’re <i>in it</i> you can’t really see how you are affecting your own problems. Though there were many things outside of my control that happened, my therapist helped me see the role I played in certain outcomes.</p>
<p>It was how I reacted that made things worse. Going to therapy helped me take more responsibility for my behavior, thoughts, and actions instead of blaming everything else for my problems.</p>
<h2>The Art of Forgiveness</h2>
<p>I’m a perfectionist and control freak, so when everything was in disarray, I hated myself for everything. I felt pathetic for needing outside help in the form of therapy and medication.</p>
<p>I was filled with shame, guilt and anxiety for my thoughts and actions. My therapist helped me stop the broken record in my mind. She helped me stop the negative self-talk — as I was actually saying the words — and rewriting the script. It’s been a tough journey, but I’ve been able to forgive myself, offer myself grace, and learn to love myself above anything and anyone else.</p>
<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
<p>If you’re going through a tough time, <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?ut" target="_blank">therapy can be so much more than just “getting help.”</a> For me, it was about re-establishing routine, finding guidance and pathways to healing and understanding. It was a solid structure when everything else was falling apart.</p>
<p>Though I’ve come out of the storm, I still look forward to therapy every Wednesday at 4 p.m.. It helps me get through the week and address any lingering issues head on, while I find my new normal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On January 17, 2010, Joshua R. Beharry <a href="http://mhpov.com/my-story/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">stood</a> on a British Columbia bridge, attempting to end his life.</p>
<p>Luckily, his attempt failed, and today Beharry is a <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/alison-tedford/joshua-beharry-advocate_b_8614862.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">mental health advocate</a> and Project Coordinator of <a href="https://headsupguys.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HeadsUpGuys</a><b>, </b>a British Columbia-based campaign to support men who have depression. He tells his story so that men, and all people with depression, can feel empowered to reach out.</p>
<p>“I didn’t really start out trying to reach men more specifically,” Beharry wrote to <i>Talkspace</i> in an email interview. “But through my work at HeadsUpGuys I’ve come to realize that a lot of guys go through similar issues and face similar barriers to reaching out as I did.”</p>
<p>Beharry is not alone. While more women than men <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/gender-differences-in-suicide-methods-1067508" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">attempt suicide</a>, more men than women — <a href="https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">3.53 times</a> more, in fact — complete it. This contradicts the widespread notion that depression, and other mental illnesses, are women’s diseases — and points to a serious gap in mental health resources for men. Researchers have found that while factors like racial discrimination and cost of mental health care prevent men from reaching out for mental health help, there’s another culprit: <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/how-men-can-confront-toxic-masculinity-why-its-important-for-mental-health/" target="_blank">toxic masculinity</a>, or harmful stereotypes about what it means to be a man.</p>
<p><span id="more-10059"></span></p>
<p>Seeking mental health support is totally normal, healthy, and can even be life-saving. So how can we help men reach out? It starts with recognizing the unique ways in which men experience and express mental illness, and addressing the stereotypes that prevent men from seeking help. Mental illness isn’t shameful or a sign of weakness: it’s a genuine and common medical issue, and everyone who suffers deserves help.</p>
<p>Beharry hopes that by encouraging men to reach out, they can get help before they hit rock bottom. “I went through a lot of unnecessary pain and struggles ’cause I didn’t reach out right away,” Beharry says. “I want to help as many people avoid that as I can.”</p>
<h2>Men and Women Express Mental Illness Differently</h2>
<p>Gender doesn’t just affect our likelihood of seeking help — it can also determine the way we experience mental illness.</p>
<p>Men with depression, for example, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/enlightened-living/200806/the-epidemic-covert-male-depression" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">may express</a> their illness through typically “masculine” behaviors. Some psychologists <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-about-men/201704/world-health-day-unmasking-male-depression" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">argue</a> that while women with depression tend to “act in,” through emotions like worthlessness, helplessness, and guilt, men are more likely to “act out,” through expressions of anger, poor impulse control, and alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>Jill E. Daino, LCSW, a Talkspace therapist with a private practice in New York City, points out that some coping behaviors like heavy drinking or unfulfilling casual sex may go unnoticed, or even be celebrated in men. Men “may know they’re not feeling well, they may know that ‘hey, maybe I’m drinking a little too much,’ or ‘maybe I’m using drugs,’ or ‘maybe I’m sleeping around a lot.’ But for men sometimes that’s seen as an accomplishment, that’s not seen as a bad thing,” Daino says.</p>
<p>This can make men’s depression tougher to spot and make it more difficult for men to acknowledge the vulnerability that lies beneath masculine bravado.</p>
<p>Toxic masculinity may also explain men’s increased risk of death by suicide. In one 2015 <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/appy.12216" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study</a>, researchers found that men’s suicide attempts were more likely to lead to death than women’s, since they were more violent. <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-45104-001" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Another 2015 study</a> found that the effects of typically masculine values, like competition, stoicism, and power, could partially explain this increased risk.</p>
<h2>Masculine Stereotypes Prevent Men from Seeking Help</h2>
<p>While it’s important for therapists to recognize how men express mental illness, this view can only help if men reach out in the first place.</p>
<p>Material and social factors like <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/06/the-struggle-of-seeking-therapy-while-poor/484970/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">socioeconomic status</a>, <a href="https://www-tc.pbs.org/wgbh/takeonestep/depression/pdf/dep_color.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">racial discrimination</a>, and lack of access to affordable therapy hold people of all genders back, as does our society’s stigma around mental illness. But men face unique barriers to getting support.</p>
<p>“I think there’s a bit more stigma attached to mental health when it comes to men. I know for myself that it was really hard to reach out and admit something was going on,” Joshua Beharry says. “Your whole life you’re kind of told guys are supposed to be strong or be the person others can lean on, but fighting depression is a different story and something you need help to do.”</p>
<p>Beharry’s personal experience is backed up by psychological research.</p>
<p>Men with typically masculine traits are likely to have decreased mental health — and are even less likely to reach out for help, <a href="http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/cou-cou0000176.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">according to a 2017 study</a>. Researchers <a href="http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/cou-cou0000176.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">found</a> that this was related to certain specific, stereotypically masculine traits. For example, men who valued self-reliance were more prone to suffer poor mental health, likely because they had difficulty seeking support. Men who valued having power over women also suffered worse mental health (showing any doubters that <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/mental-health-feminist-issue/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">feminism</a> is <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/how-men-can-confront-toxic-masculinity-why-its-important-for-mental-health/" target="_blank">good for men</a>, after all). This tendency to be stoic about suffering not only impacts men’s mental health — it also prevents men from getting <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743515003813" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">physical healthcare</a> as well.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, black and other men of racial minorities face <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/how-mental-health-activists-are-fighting-racism/" target="_blank">an added set of barriers</a>, due to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-about-men/201711/the-mental-health-impact-blame-black-man-syndrome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">systemic discrimination</a>,<a href="http://ourselvesblack.com/journal/2016/6/5/handle-with-care-a-conversation-with-black-men-on-mental-and-emotional-health" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> racial stereotypes</a>, and <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yougoodman-black-men-and-mental-health_us_5951de6ae4b0c85b96c65c3d" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">cultural stigma</a> against mental illness.</p>
<p>These <a href="https://www.nami.org/Blogs/NAMI-Blog/March-2018/5-Myths-that-Prevent-Men-from-Fighting-Depression" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">myths about men and mental health</a> — that being depressed makes you a burden, for example, or that its cowardly to reach out for help — can be so deeply ingrained that men may not even recognize them.</p>
<p>“When I was severely depressed about 8 years ago now, I didn’t reach out till my symptoms were too bad to hide. And a lot of the masculine stereotypes that prevented me from reaching out were so ingrained in my character and how I saw myself that I didn’t really even realize where they were coming from,” Beharry says.</p>
<h2>How to Support the Men in Your Life</h2>
<p>All this research on the negative effects of masculinity can make it seem like anyone who identifies as masculine will suffer mental illness. But that’s not true. Instead, these sobering facts offer us an opportunity to redefine masculinity and to encourage a culture where it’s okay for men to ask for help.</p>
<p>This is precisely what activists like Beharry are trying to do. Whatever your gender, you can help them by <a href="https://natashatracy.com/mental-illness-issues/mental-illness-stigma-kills/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">working to reduce the stigma</a> associated with mental illness, and being supportive of the men in your life. If you’re worried about a man close to you, don’t be afraid to reach out.</p>
<p>“Just letting a guy know you’re there can be a big help,” Beharry says.</p>
<p>Jill Daino agrees. She suggests having a frank conversation with your loved one and making it clear that you’re thinking about them and you’re available if they need help. She suggests openers like: “I’ve noticed you’ve been having a hard time. It might be helpful to talk about it.”</p>
<p>Daino also stresses that simply encouraging your loved one to open up is a vital first step.</p>
<p>“It’s laying the groundwork,” Daino says. “Be direct, be supportive, and then offer concrete help be that a referral, be that someone to talk to, another friend or family member if you’re not the right person.”</p>
<h2>How to Reach out If You’re a Man Suffering from Mental Illness</h2>
<p>If you’re a man suffering from mental illness — or simply struggling through a rough patch — remember: you’re not alone, you’re not a burden, and you’re not “weak” for reaching out.</p>
<p>“It’s important that guys realize that fighting depression is the same as fighting any other health issue and that seeing a doctor is a good first step,” Joshua Beharry recommends.”It may be a bit intimidating or stressful the first couple times but it’s worth doing if you’re unsure about your health or what’s going on.”</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to reach out: you can talk to a trusted friend, doctor, or therapist. Daino notes that she has more male patients in her online practice than her brick-and-mortar one, and that young men especially may find online therapy more accessible, both emotionally and financially.</p>
<p>How you ask for help doesn’t matter: it just matters that you do.</p>
<p><b>Men Transforming Mental Health </b></p>
<p>While toxic masculinity remains a barrier, Daino says she does see things changing, with more men able to open up today than in the past.</p>
<p>It’s a conversation men are leading. Numerous <a href="http://themaneffect.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">projects</a> around <a href="https://www.drobaricartman.com/curriculum" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">masculinity and mental health</a> challenge toxic masculinity and redefine <a href="https://goodmenproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">what it means to be a man</a>. The men leading these movements say there’s no shame in being vulnerable, being open, helping others and asking for help in turn.</p>
<p>For Joshua Beharry, opening up about his own mental illness was the first step in encouraging other men to seek help for theirs.</p>
<p>“If I can recover even after trying to take my own life, then other people can, too,” Beharry says. “And it’s a lot easier the sooner you reach out.”</p>

<hr />
<p>Teenage years can be some of the most difficult and stressful times of our lives. With exam deadlines and social pressures, it can leave many of us struggling to focus and see a life outside of the school halls. There are many who are made for education, flying through their school years with ease, but for some of us, our mental health can be compromised.</p>
<p>I found myself often confused and unable to make decisions. I was always worrying about rejection and causing problems. Stress was consuming me. Although I had friends, a boyfriend, and a family, I still could not tell them the truth, or at least not the <i>full</i> truth. Choosing to begin therapy was the first time I had put myself first in a long time. The term “it feels like a weight has been lifted” really resonates with me.</p>
<p><span id="more-9942"></span></p>
<h2>Starting Therapy</h2>
<p>I was 16 years old when I first started <a href="https://talkspace.com/online-therapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a>. I had been struggling with depression and anxiety for a very long time and struggled to let out my emotions in a healthy way. When I fell into substance abuse, my parents worked with my school to find me some help. One day a week, I would get a free “get out of jail free” pass from lessons and would make my way to this almost secret room to meet my therapist.</p>
<p>I remember how nice it felt to find privacy away from the prying ears of those I knew. The ability to be totally honest, and know that what we discussed would not leave these four walls, allowed me to breathe for the first time. Letting out your feelings, all those hidden thoughts and bricks that you have been lugging around for months, or even years, feels better than any other endorphin releasing activity.</p>
<p>It can be awkward to share your feelings with a stranger. There were worries that what I disclosed may come out as rude, nasty or even lead the therapist to report me as a danger to myself. However, the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/">therapist</a> was very good at breaking the ice each session and when I started to talk, I couldn’t stop. It was like a blocked pipe being released and drained — it needs to be looked after to function. I cannot explain how good it felt just to let myself rant and not stop my “verbal diarrhoea” — almost like using the loo after holding in a wee for hours, a release that just leaves you feeling relaxed and detoxed.</p>
<p>As time went on, I found myself more comfortable talking about what was going on in my mind. I learnt that I was not a problem, that my thoughts were valid, and I had every right to feel the way I did. It is so strange to hear these words but when someone reminds you that “it’s ok not to be ok,” it jogs you back into reality, and makes you think differently.</p>
<h2>Why Therapy is Important</h2>
<p>I am now back in therapy after putting it on hold for many years, but I am excited. I’ve only had a few sessions so far, and already I feel so much more refreshed and in control of my own body. It’s easier to fight a battle when you have someone to stand by your side. Talking is the first step and the key to defeating those demons that reside in your mind.</p>
<p>Therapy has not necessarily helped me with one particular issue that I have, it has generally helped me manage and cope with my thoughts and feelings. I feel so much more human, and I am truly grateful that I have access to therapy. I always recommend it to anyone. Sometimes we just need to vent so we can learn more about ourselves.</p>
<p>Therapy has been so important to my recovery. It has given me an outlet for my feelings, and its brief lessons help me unlock parts of myself that I have repressed. It’s exhausting and it’s hard, but I now know myself better than ever. I understand who I am and why my mind does what it does. <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_POST_INLINE&amp;utr_adgroup=therapy-helped-me-learn-to-share-my-feelings?utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/therapy-helped-me-learn-to-share-feelings" target="_blank">Therapy is like a friend you can rely on</a>, at least it has been to me.</p>
