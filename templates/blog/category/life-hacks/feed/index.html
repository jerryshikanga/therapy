				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The end of the year is here, and for most of us this is a time when we start thinking about how things can change in the new year. Many of us set up resolutions in the new year to be better, look better and act better.</p>
<p>Culturally, goals for the new year often focus on changing our physical selves. But what if we devoted some tried and true goal setting approaches to changing our emotional and psychological selves too?</p>
<p>As we prepare for the new year give some thought to how you’d like for your emotional life to be better in 2018. Would you like to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/7-self-care-tips-for-when-stress-affects-your-body/" target="_blank">practice better self-care</a>? How about ending some old relationship patterns rooted in past hurt?<span id="more-8713"></span></p>
<p>You might also seek to intentionally develop your understanding of yourself in a way you haven’t before. Take some time to give yourself the space you deserve in taking care of both your physical and mental health. Set your sights on some mental health-centered goals to help make this next year one of your best yet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/09/online-therapy-can-help-reach-goals/" target="_blank">Goal setting and living up to those goals</a> is no easy feat. Daily responsibilities can often get in the way. It’s not long after the new year skirts by that we find ourselves floundering at our goals.</p>
<p>This year is going to be different! This year let’s embrace the possibilities of what a healthier, happier you can bring. This guide will help you take stock of this past year, identify concrete strategies to make your goals achievable and help make 2018 far better than 2017.</p>
<h2>Take Stock of the Past Year</h2>
<p>During the holiday season it can be tough to maintain focus and not get too distracted. From school or work responsibilities, as well as social obligations, this time of year often flies by. As you begin to think about embracing the new year, it’s important not to rush to make decisions about what your goals should be. Instead actually set aside some time to sit back and take stock of the previous year.</p>
<p>You can review your year by setting aside 30 minutes (perhaps on a weekend day) to sit in quiet reflection with no distractions. Yes, this means putting all those devices away! Sit down with a pen and paper and examine the high points of the year. Then examine the low points. These could be across all sorts of areas of your life, from work to school to romance.</p>
<p>Once you have your highs and lows written down, take a moment and look at those highs. Are there contributions you made to enable those highs to occur? If so, great! Perhaps you can maintain those behaviors in the new year. You may even want to challenge yourself to take those behaviors just one small step forward.</p>
<p>Now, take a look at those lows. These difficult parts of your year are very important pieces of information. These low points can help you identify the circumstances that led to those events or feelings. Ask yourself, “Are there ways my behavior contributed to this or was this only circumstance?”</p>
<p>This introspection may help inspire some points of exploration around future self-improvement goals for the new year. If you’re able to identify behaviors or patterns that don’t sit well with you, write one down. Add a very small task you can do to work toward making that one behavior better.</p>
<h2>Utilize SMART Goals</h2>
<p>Part of the reason why many resolutions fail is not that they are bad goals to have, but we often don’t take the time to pare them down to easily definable and concrete, progressive steps. Utilizing the approach of <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm" target="_blank">SMART goals</a> will assist you with moving forward with your goals gradually and help you have easily observable points of progress.</p>
<p>First, make your goals as SPECIFIC as possible. That is, if your goal is, “I want to eat healthier,” that is quite vague. Instead, try to focus on the ways in which you’d like to eat healthier. Would you like to eat the recommended daily amount of vegetables? What about eating less sugar regularly? When you are specific about your goals, it is much easier to identify progress and track any setbacks.</p>
<p>SMART goals are also MEASURABLE, meaning they are data-driven. If your plan is to be more fit in the new year, how do you intend to measure that? It might be helpful to track certain bodily measurements like waist, shoulders, chest, etc. These data points won’t lie and may be good ways to measure your changes over time.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to spend more time centering your mind through <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/finding-inner-peace-mindfulness-5-senses/" target="_blank">meditation</a> or guided visualization, how much time would you like to devote to that practice? Whether it’s 10 minutes per day or 10 minutes per week, it’s important to have an easily measurable source of data that’s not subject to interpretation.</p>
<p>It’s also incredibly important for goals to be ACHIEVABLE. Sometimes resolutions can be lofty, and it might not be realistic or healthy to think you’re going to lose 10 pounds in the first month of the new year. Instead do some research to see how others have made progress in the area of your goal and learn if your goal actually fits your lifestyle in an attainable and achievable way. While no two stories or experiences are the same, it’s important to have some third-party structure to work from as you adjust and make your own standards</p>
<p>Along with your goals being achievable, it is important for your goals to be RELEVANT OR REALISTIC. Ask yourself, “Is this the right time to undertake this goal? And is this goal actually worthwhile for me?”</p>
<p>SMART goals are also TIME-BOUND, which means you set a reasonable time frame to achieve your resolutions for the new year. Would you like to start therapy within the first two months of the year? How about reaching your goal weight by Memorial Day? Could you practice self-care for a few minutes each day of the work week? These are all examples of time-bound goals you can consider in the new year.</p>
<h2>Make Your Goals Personal</h2>
<p>There are a lot of pressures out there to look or be a certain way, and this can certainly impact our resolutions for the new year. To boost motivation and capacity to achieve your goals it is paramount that these goals are personal and important to you. Without this strong internal desire for these things to change, you might find yourself facing failure, and sooner than you would like. Take a moment to ask yourself honestly not what you want to leave behind in the new year, but more so, “What do I want to gain?”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;<a href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/the-simple-attitude-change-that-will-dramatically-improve-your-life" target="_blank">This Simple Attitude Change Will Dramatically Improve Your Quality of Life</a>&#8221; originally appeared on <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/" target="_blank">Fairygodboss</a>, an online career community for women, by women.</em></p>
<p>What if I told you there was one simple technique that could improve every aspect of your life? No, it’s not a green juice, or the newest superfood, or even <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/zen-meditation" target="_blank">meditation</a>, though those all have their benefits! It’s a mindset shift called reframing.</p>
<p>I am a huge fan of hyperbole. Why tell someone I am hungry when I can tell them I am wasting away as we speak, punctuated by as many dramatically place swears as possible, accompanied by a gif. While this approach might be amusing when deployed positively, it can also backfire in negative situations. Using that same mentality, a setback at work can become a career-ender, a holiday weight-gain can turn into berating yourself for lack of self-control, and an unexpected breakup can lead to an internal monologue about how unloveable you are. What I&#8217;m referring to is <a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/wellness/reframe-negative-mindset-feel-stuck-according-psychologist/2034308" target="_blank">negative self-talk</a>.<span id="more-8635"></span></p>
<p>Negative thinking is so pervasive in our culture that we often don’t notice this running commentary in our heads, undermining our success. There are different kinds of ways to engage in negative self-talk. The most obvious is by directing harmful statements at ourselves. This includes looking in the mirror and saying, either out loud or in your head, something insulting. Some examples: “I look disgusting.” “I’m so fat.” “Nothing looks good on me, I might as well give up.” Women are told constantly how far they are from attaining the moving target of perfection, to the point where even goddess/model <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/how-chrissy-teigen-dealt-with-work-when-she-had-postpartum-depression" target="_blank">Chrissy Teigen</a> is <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/2017/05/153132/chrissy-teigen-liposuction-confession" target="_blank">getting her armpit fat sucked out</a> to look better in dresses. No wonder we internalize those messages and direct them at ourselves.</p>
<p>The next kind of negative self-talk is deflecting compliments, lest we appear full of ourselves (aka confident). Rather than graciously saying “<a href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/thank-you-email-after-an-interview-example" target="_blank">thank you</a>,” we scramble to find a way to delegitimize the statement. We respond to “I love your jeans.” with “They were on sale!” as if we are apologizing for having good taste and making up for it with a bargain. This kind of deflection isn’t limited to our bodies or physical appearances, either.</p>
<p>Women regularly <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/12/29/new_chrome_app_helps_women_stop_saying_just_and_sorry_in_emails.html" target="_blank">preemptively apologize</a> for having a thought or opinion, both verbally and in emails. This may not seem like negative self-talk, but how much less confident can you get than prefacing your contribution with a qualifier that says your thoughts really aren’t that important?</p>
<p>The last common kind of negative self-talk is <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/09/09/549133027/for-teens-knee-deep-in-negativity-reframing-thoughts-can-help" target="_blank">so subtle </a>we usually miss it. It is the momentary gut reaction that says we are not good enough. How many times have we caught a glimpse of ourselves in a reflection from an unflattering angle, or without makeup, and thought, “Ugh, I look awful.”?</p>
<p>Or how many times have we ordered something to eat, silently judged ourselves while eating, and then felt sick and remorseful afterwards? There’s no further commentary to it, no long diatribe towards ourselves and our choices, but that feeling in the pit of our stomachs does not vanish instantly. That pervasive feeling of self-judgment is probably the most insidious version of negative self-talk, because it feels like a mist we can never put our fingers on.</p>
<p>If asked how often we engage in negative self-talk, we would probably not even remember that moment, and if we are not aware of all the ways it can show up, it is impossible to <a href="http://www.usc.edu.au/media/3850/Reframingyourthinking.pdf" target="_blank">change the habit</a>.</p>
<p>So then, if it’s everywhere, how do we change this? With a technique called <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-the-face-adversity/201209/positive-reframing-optimistic-thinking" target="_blank">positive reframing</a>. Positive reframing is not pretending everything is fine when it isn’t, or stopping yourself from experiencing negative or painful thoughts and emotions. Start simple. Have you ever declined plans, only to see your friends having fun on social media and immediately experience extreme FOMO?</p>
<p>Positively reframing an idea like “I’m such a loser for staying in when everyone else is out having a good time” helps it become “I love that my friends are such extroverts and allow me to have my introverted moments.” Notice that it doesn’t erase the negative feeling, nor does it designate any one choice as the correct one. Positive reframing looks at a situation and rather than assigning blame or judgment, simply makes observations about what has happened and what it might mean if it is used constructively for the future.</p>
<p>So how do you break this habit?</p>
<p>1. Stop and notice when you are having a negative conversation with yourself. Refer back to the examples above to remember that not all negative self-talk is direct and verbal.</p>
<p>2. Identify what evidence supports this idea. For example, if you tell yourself that you are not qualified for a job you want, ask yourself “Do other people with my qualifications have similar positions? Do I have a passion for this work and a willingness to learn? Does the job description have non-negotiable requirements in it that I do not meet, or more general desires for the position?</p>
<p>3. Start to identify patterns. Are there consistent situations you find yourself in, or behaviors in others, that set you off on criticizing yourself? These are your triggers. Spend time thinking about where these might come from. Perhaps you had a parent, sibling, friend, significant other, coworker, or boss in the past who treated you a certain way and you felt powerless to respond, so you turned inward to try to regain a sense of control over the situation.</p>
<p>4. Change “I” to “You” in your negative statements. Rather than saying, “I am so lazy” when you skip the gym again, say “You are so lazy” and notice the difference in how it feels. You would never tell your best friend, “You look fat and awful” upon seeing her in an outfit, so why is it okay to do the same thing to yourself? Externalizing the <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/constructive-criticism" target="_blank">criticism</a> can make it sound as harsh as it is because it implies telling someone else you love that they are not good enough, which you would never do.</p>
<p>5. <a href="https://totalwomenscycling.com/fitness/sports-psychology-reframing-negative-thoughts" target="_blank">Practice positive reframing</a> every time you notice yourself engaging in negative self-talk. It can show up in any situation, in a variety of statements. Here are some examples to help you start practicing:</p>
<p>“I can’t believe I ate the whole thing, I’m so disgusting. No wonder my pants don’t fit.” &#8212;&gt; “I ate the whole thing and don’t feel so well now. I am not going to beat myself up over it but hopefully next time I am tempted, I’ll remember this unpleasant feeling.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t lost any weight, even though I’ve been working out. If it’s not even going to work, I might as well save the money on a gym membership and lie on my couch.” &#8212;&gt; “I’ve been working out because I value my body and want it to be strong and powerful, and to keep me healthy for a long time. Fitness is an investment in my future, even if I don’t see immediate, aesthetic results.”</p>
<p>“I hate going to the gym. I should skip it today.” &#8212;&gt; “I always feel so great after working out that I look forward to that endorphin rush. It takes the <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/hard-work-quotes" target="_blank">hard work</a> of actually getting there for me to reap that reward, but it’s worth it.”</p>
<p>“I <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/i-hate-my-job" target="_blank">hate my job</a>, I hate my coworkers, I hate everything. I don’t want to adult anymore.” &#8212;&gt; “Things are tough right now and I’m feeling pretty disconnected from work. I wonder if I can change anything about my job, my situation, or even my expectations about my job, and start to feel better.”</p>
<p>“I got ghosted, again. Obviously I’m worthless and no one will ever love me. I’m just going to die alone.” &#8212;&gt; “I learned some lessons about what I do and don’t want in a relationship, and every experience gets me closer to finding the right fit.”</p>
<p>“I’m in so much debt. I’m so irresponsible. I’m never going to climb out of this hole so I might as well treat myself.” &#8212;&gt; “This mountain of debt can feel insurmountable when I look at the whole thing, but there are probably small steps I could start taking to improve my situation in the long run.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Near the end of each year most of us are chomping at the bit, anxiously awaiting some much-needed downtime. As business slows down and responsibilities wane, people look forward to much-needed rest and rejuvenation. This break is also an opportunity to finally unplug.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of emerging research on the effects of technology use on our collective mental health, but what’s most important to understand about technology is how <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-volpi-md-pc-facs/technology-depression_b_1723625.html" target="_blank">ubiquitous connectivity can exacerbate worry, fear, sadness</a> and a host of other emotions. If unchecked, this effect could contribute to <a href="http://everhelperblog.com/technology-related-mental-fatigue-is-the-illness-of-the-21st-century-treatment-and-prevention-techniques/" target="_blank">mental fatigue</a>.<span id="more-8623"></span></p>
<p>A new problem in recent generations has been, in part, the accessibility of information that most of us have through the use of technology. We constantly use computers, tablets, and smartphones to check in on news, learn, and connect with others. The downside to that behavior is that we often find ourselves inundated with information during almost every waking minute of the day. This bombardment can lead to increased feelings of stress, worry, anxiety, and depression. Taking time to consciously unplug may help increase the restoration power of any time off during the holiday season.</p>
<p>“Unplugging” doesn’t necessarily mean stepping away from your devices altogether (but that could also be healthful). It can also involve approaching your technology use with much more intention and consciousness, something we don’t have most days when we scroll down our timelines or newsfeeds. Stop to consider the number of accounts you follow on Twitter that report the news. How many people do you follow who editorialize that same news? You might be unconsciously double-dipping and contributing to your own mental fatigue without even knowing it.</p>
<p>The holiday season is a good time to review your social media accounts and home in on what’s most important for you to know. That way, as you get back to your normal routine, you’ve already de-escalated one prevalent source of stress.</p>
<p>Our bodies also stand to gain a lot from unplugging from technology. For one, our eyes can rest! Stop a moment to consider how many hours of a day you spend looking at a computer or smart device. More than likely, it’s a lot of time. Our visual systems need refuge from that activity. Unplugging during the holiday season can offer you that restoration.</p>
<p>When we are using technology, we often neglect our physical selves quite a bit,too. We sit in the same position (or a similar one) for hours on end doing work, connecting, or reading the news. If you take some time to unplug, you’ll be doing your body a favor. Stretching and checking in with your posture and body more during downtime might highlight the need to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/7-self-care-tips-for-when-stress-affects-your-body/" target="_blank">be more physically attentive</a> on average days. It can also be a helpful reset to get you back on a healthier track overall.</p>
<p>Finally, taking time to unplug this holiday season might foster better social connections. While we love communicating with friends and family via social media sites, there is no replacement for hearing laughter in person, or getting a warm hug from someone who cares about you. Spending real face time with those you love most will help strengthen those relationships and reaffirm why you keep them in the first place.</p>

<p>Have you ever had that inner voice inside nudge you to do something you knew was going to be beneficial, but also difficult? One of those things that is tough enough for you to choose not to do it and stay in your comfort zone? We all have. There is an opportunity to go through that difficulty and get to the other side. We know that if we were to take said action we would benefit, but sometimes something holds us back. That something is going through the temporary pain, frustration and difficulty, even though we know there are greener pastures on the other side.</p>
<p>Here are a few things you can do to help yourself push through the pain, get to the other side, improve your well being and thrive! It’s time to get out of our little box and create a life far beyond our wildest imaginations. Without the extra push, we stay stuck and we settle for less than our potential.<span id="more-8551"></span></p>
<p>Exercise is the perfect example of how we give ourselves healthy stress to get stronger. As you see, many of the people in the US and around the world don’t like to exercise even though all the science shows that you will feel better, live longer, and be happier. What do we need, to be hit in the head?</p>
<p>Changing your diet or cutting out a crutch is another tough thing to do, but you know that you’ll be better once you do it. Too much caffeine, too much sugar, too much food in general, all can be harmful, but some people don’t want to go through the pain and discomfort of giving it up to get to the amazing feeling of strength and vibrancy.</p>
<p>I recommend starting with small difficulties to get used to being in a tough situation, this is what yoga is all about. We create a safe environment to challenge ourselves, our mind body system learns how to deal with difficulty, and it becomes easier and easier over time.</p>
<p>Here are a few other things you can do to get the ball rolling:</p>
<h2>Meditation</h2>
<p>Sit for just a short time. Of course, you have to do something that’s challenging for you, so if you’re used to meditating, find something different. When I started my meditation practice, I couldn’t sit still for longer than a few minutes. After pushing through the tough times, I’m able to sit comfortably for 20-30 minutes and I love it. I feel the benefits all day long from a great meditation.</p>
<h2>Crucial Conversations</h2>
<p>I’m sure there is someone in your life who you’ve been avoiding or a conversation you’ve yet to have for one reason or another. Why are you waiting? This shows up in relationships a lot and sometimes people stay in relationships too long. I know I used to, but now, thanks to my wife and our communication, we make it a practice to deal with things as they come up. It’s definitely made our relationship better.</p>
<h2>Travel to New Places</h2>
<p>I love to travel and get excited about visiting new places, but I know that’s not the case for many people. If you’re one of those people, make it a point to get out of your comfort zone. Even if it’s a different section of your own city. Make a choice to do something out of the ordinary and you’ll always find that you’ve grown as a human being.</p>
<h2>Be By Yourself</h2>
<p>I know I’m guilty of checking my phone when Lauren goes to the bathroom while we’re at dinner, are you? Don’t lie. See if you can avoid that next time. Just sit, like we used to do, be uncomfortable in your skin and see what happens. I bet you won’t regret it.</p>
<p>There are a multitude of things we can do to push ourselves in a healthy way. The way muscles stay strong is through use of the muscle. You push it, it recovers, you push it a little more. The same is true for our psyche. There is a great cartoon that shows two booths, one booth has a sign that says ‘Uncomfortable Truths’ and the other booth says ‘Pleasant Lies.’ Guess which one has the huge line in front of it? That’s right, most people want to be told pleasant lies over uncomfortable truths. Don’t be one of the sheep in this world, take the road less traveled, you won’t regret it. I’m always here to help you along the way if you need some!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As joyous as the holiday season can be, it is not immune from difficulties. If you’re living with a mental illness, dealing with the holiday cheer, increased expectations, and interacting more with family may prove to be overwhelming at times. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/stress/" target="_blank">Stress</a> is often at an all-time high during the holiday season.</p>
<p>Here are some tips to help keep you mentally healthier throughout the holidays.</p>
<h2>Tip 1: Be Honest With Yourself</h2>
<p>Too often, we rely on others’ standards and expectations for us to dictate how we spend our time during the holidays. This pattern can lead to a crisis when you consider the already stressful season of spending extra money and a condensed amount of time with family members who may not understand your mental illness.<span id="more-8530"></span></p>
<p>Surviving the holiday starts with being candid with yourself about your desires, abilities, and limitations. Being honest about your need for extra space, or quiet time, or only visiting for a certain amount of time (irrespective of pressures placed on you) are some of the ways you can carve out holiday time with your relatives and loved ones in a way that works best for you. If you can be more honest with yourself and those around you about what works and what doesn’t, you will likely come out on the other side of the holiday season feeling more balanced than in previous years.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about how to have these boundary setting conversations with those around you, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/" target="_blank">connecting with a therapist</a> can be helpful.</p>
<h2>Tip 2: Share and Educate</h2>
<p>Sometimes the people around us during the holidays cannot understand what goes on inside our hearts and minds. This communication barrier can make interactions really difficult. For instance, they may not understand how your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/different-types-anxiety-disorders-classified/" target="_blank">anxiety disorder</a> makes talking with distant relatives almost impossible. They may not understand how you worked for the past few months with your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a> to curb binge eating and are now stressed about what you consume during holiday dinner. These are issues you may want to overcome to get the best out of your holiday season.</p>
<p>Due to this knowledge gap, relatives may inadvertently trigger or pressure you to engage in ways that aren’t healthiest for you. In these moments, it may be best if you can share and educate someone about what challenges you’re facing so you have an ally around the holidays. Additionally, having a pre-holiday conversation with a loved one you trust to be supportive might help reduce some of the anticipatory anxiety. You might even come up with some signals when you’re in need of extra support.</p>
<p>If you know you’ll be around people who are otherwise supportive but lack education about mental illness, it might be helpful to send them some articles or videos about mental health issues before the holidays hit so that they can try their best to do what they can to support you.</p>
<h2>Tip 3: Carve Out Solo Activities and Seek Refuge</h2>
<p>If you don’t spend the majority of the year with your family, it can be overwhelming to get back into the groove with family members during the holiday season. For many, it can also be overwhelming to engage with extended family members and friends of the family whom you also don’t keep up with often.</p>
<p>Creating a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/7-self-care-tips-for-when-stress-affects-your-body/" target="_blank">self-care plan</a> ahead of time with potential solo activities and places of refuge can be helpful in keeping you balanced during the holidays. Think ahead of the environment where you will be spending most of your time. Are there places where you can find a few minutes of solitude if you feel overwhelmed? Will the weather allow you to take a brief, solo walk outside if the time indoors becomes too stifling?</p>
<p>Perhaps you can commiserate with a friend via text or phone call to break up the down time. And, my personal favorite, it’s always wise to have a good book on hand when you need a few minutes to yourself. Most of the time, people will give you at least a little time and space to indulge in some healthy escapism.</p>
<p>If you’re currently working with a therapist, it might also be helpful to talk with them beforehand about your concerns. They can help you construct the specifics of your plan and can even recommend steps to take if you experience some sort of crisis.</p>
<p>No matter how you are spending the holidays, there are steps you can take to make the season easier if you live with mental illness. Taking some of these initiatives will help you make the best of your holiday season no matter how or with whom you spend them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since 2012, the Tuesday after Thanksgiving is when we celebrate #GivingTuesday. An initiative born out of the Belfer Center for Innovation &amp; Social Impact in New York, the day has taken hold as a time to get in the holiday spirit by giving to charities and nonprofits around the country to support the critical work these organizations do to help those in need.</p>
<p>But more than that, the spirit of #GivingTuesday can be the perfect time to remind ourselves that there are so many ways to give each year, not just through monetary donations, but through our actions toward ourselves and others, particularly around mental health.</p>
<p>So this #GivingTuesday, celebrate the day by giving in a mentally healthy way with these seven ideas.<span id="more-8473"></span></p>
<h2>1. Get Educated</h2>
<p>Mental health is one of those topics that comes with many misconceptions. This #GivingTuesday take the time to educate yourself about the realities of mental illness to truly understand what you or a loved one might be going through.</p>
<p>This can be done by reading books, reading reputable articles on the internet, such as the ones on <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/" target="_blank">our blog</a>, or even talking to professionals and friends who know a lot about the topic. Knowledge is power, and in this case, it provides the opportunity to be more empathetic to those living with mental illness, and better support them.</p>
<p>“Educate yourself,” <a href="https://themighty.com/2016/03/21-ways-to-be-a-good-friend-for-someone-with-a-mental-illness/" target="_blank">wrote</a> Paige Alyssa O’Connor in The Mighty. “You don’t need to understand everything or even why it’s happening, but a little knowledge can go a long way when it comes to support.”</p>
<h2>2. Help Destigmatize</h2>
<p>Destigmatizing mental health is crucial to building a society that cares for people living with mental illness because stigma can prevent many from getting the help they need, be hurtful, and cause undue othering of those with mental illness.</p>
<p>Help destigmatize mental health by countering harmful opinions and language you encounter with accurate knowledge. This may lead to one of those dreaded awkward holiday conversations with a judging relative or a heated debate with a coworker, but our friends living with mental illness can’t be the only ones doing the hard work of educating the public about the realities of mental illness.</p>
<p>“I find that when people understand the true facts of what a mental illness is, being a disease, they think twice about making comments,” <a href="https://www.nami.org/Blogs/NAMI-Blog/October-2017/9-Ways-to-Fight-Mental-Health-Stigma" target="_blank">wrote</a> Megan Dotson on the NAMI blog. “I also remind them that they wouldn&#8217;t make fun of someone with diabetes, heart disease, or cancer.”</p>
<h2>3. Reach Out To A Friend</h2>
<p>The holidays can be hard for many living with mental illness, which also makes it the perfect time to reach out to friends just to say hello or check in and see how they are doing. This can be as simple as sending a text or giving them a quick phone call.</p>
<p>“Just calling to ask how I’m doing means a great deal,” said Winona O’Reilly in The Mighty.</p>
<p>If your loved one is up for it, offer to visit or spend time together, take them out for coffee, dole out hugs if they want, or lend an open set of ears. Meet your friend where they are at, and respect what they need, letting them know you support them unconditionally.</p>
<p>“The biggest support for me is to be validated,” Melissa Fryburger-Long was quoted saying to The Mighty. “Let me know it’s OK to feel this way. I’ll be here for you and promise not to fix you, but to support you.”</p>
<h2>4. Volunteer</h2>
<p>If you’re feeling action-oriented this holiday season, then there’s no time like the present to find a worthy cause to volunteer for, whether it’s at a women’s shelter, crisis center, a hospital, or somewhere else entirely. Your time and talent are worthy gifts that will benefit those in need, and often volunteering is just as rewarding for the volunteer as the nonprofit.</p>
<p>“Volunteering and helping others can help you reduce stress, combat depression, keep you mentally stimulated, and provide a sense of purpose,” <a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/healthy-living/volunteering-and-its-surprising-benefits.htm" target="_blank">according to</a> The Help Guide. “Giving in even simple ways can help those in need and improve your health and happiness.”</p>
<p>By getting involved in a cause, you have the opportunity to meet new people, build self-confidence, have a sense of purpose, increase your own happiness, combat stress, anxiety, and depression, and many other benefits. At the end of the day, volunteering is a win-win situation.</p>
<h2>5. Mental Health First Aid</h2>
<p>You’ve likely heard of CPR and first aid classes for physical ailments, but how about mental health first aid? Turns out there is a nationwide initiative to train people how to respond to mental health crises the same way you would respond in a medical emergency.</p>
<p>Since its inception, <a href="https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/" target="_blank">Mental Health First Aid</a> has reached more than 1 million people in the United States, providing training that “gives you the skills you need to reach out and provide initial help and support to someone who may be developing a mental health or substance use problem or experiencing a crisis.”</p>
<p>If you want to get trained, classes are offered nationwide. As a bonus, the eight-hour training course is free and is offered in youth and adult specializations in both English and Spanish. It’s a great way to get educated, help destigmatize mental illness, and know how to help friends all at the same time.</p>
<h2>6. Practice Self-Care</h2>
<p>In the season of giving, don’t forget to schedule some time for your own self-care. Make sure you’re spending time on activities that increase your well-being, like participating in hobbies, enjoying downtime with pets, or catching up on your favorite TV shows or movies.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to also care for your body by eating right — Thanksgiving aside — making time to exercise, and sleeping on a regular schedule. Schedule doctor appointments to make sure your health is in tip-top shape. After all, your mind needs your body to function well.</p>
<p>Finally, make connections with the members of your support network who nourish your soul.</p>
<p>“Spending time with positive, loving people you care about and trust can ease stress, help your mood and improve the way you feel overall,” <a href="http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/taking-good-care-yourself" target="_blank">according to</a> Mental Health America. “They may be family members, close friends, members of a support group, or a peer counselor at the local drop-in center.”</p>
<h2>7. Get Support</h2>
<p>Actor Jenny Mollen quipped, “There are two types of people in the world: those who think everyone needs therapy, and those who have never been.”</p>
<p>The value of therapy and professional mental health support can’t be underestimated. We don’t need to wait until we’re in crisis to start therapy — it can be supportive at any point in our lives. Not to mention, to give to others in a mentally healthy way, it’s crucial our own mental health is stable, and that starts by getting support. You can’t pour from an empty glass.</p>
<p>Consider reaching out to find a therapist if you don’t already have one or strengthen your existing mental health support system by joining a support, 12-step or therapy group. Just a little extra boost can go a long way.</p>
<p>“The importance of incorporating joy, spirit, and relaxation in your life has many implications in developing resiliency and staying healthy,” writes Mental Health America. “The four C&#8217;s to joy, spirit, and relaxation are: connect with yourself, connect with others, connect to your community, and create joy and satisfaction.”<br />
This #GivingTuesday, keep in mind the four C’s that can help cultivate a sense of well-being for both others and yourself all while giving in a mentally healthy way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, studies of happiness and emotional well-being have gained popularity in the psychology world, as well as in mainstream media. There has been a massive uptick in research on the nature of gratitude — how we can better harness and cultivate it, its potential impacts on physical health, as well as on mental and emotional well-being.</p>
<p>As 2017 comes to a close, and life start to amp up for the holidays, many of us may use this time as an opportunity to reflect on the last year — what challenges we were met with, but also what brought us great joy. For so many of us this year, simple things like reading the news became troubling and overwhelming parts of daily life. At times, it felt like images of violence, or word of another political scandal, or devastating environmental issues were simply inescapable parts of living in our modern world.<span id="more-8467"></span></p>
<p>When we feel so overwrought with this negativity and pandemic heartache, it can be all too easy to lose perspective on the parts of our lives we should actually be taking the time to feel grateful for on a regular basis. As we move toward this new year together, it’s more important than ever to recognize that, although there are parts of being a global citizen that can be scary and distressing, there is so much about this human experience that should be celebrated and met with a grateful and open heart.</p>
<p>Creating a more active awareness surrounding the abundance and positivity in our lives can be an advantageous approach to adopt year-round. This shift in focus from a place of lacking to a place of contentedness actually has mental and physical health benefits backed by science.</p>
<p>In the spirit of the upcoming holidays, here are four scientifically-proven benefits of practicing gratitude in your daily life:</p>
<h2>1. Improved Self-Esteem</h2>
<p>In our digitally-driven world, it has become all too easy to waste our precious time and energy comparing our own lives to the “highlight reels” we see on our peers’ social media platforms. This contemporary version of “Keeping Up With the Joneses” can send many of us into a spiral of self-doubt, negative self-talk, and the destructive and usually inaccurate belief that our current circumstances simply don’t size up to those of our peers.</p>
<p>The distraction and distortion of social media can all too easily take us out of our own lives and stories, and remove us from all of the good that surrounds us in the here and now. Comparing ourselves to others (whether it be in terms of career achievements, social status, or physical appearance) often results in increased resentment toward others and, subsequently, a decrease in self-esteem. When we begin to actively express gratitude for our own lives and circumstances, self-esteem will naturally increase, leading to an overall higher quality of life.</p>
<h2>2. Better Sleep</h2>
<p>Bedtime can be an anxiety provoking time for many of us. People often find themselves ruminating on negative thoughts or parts of their days while trying to drift off to sleep, resulting in delayed or fragmented snooze time.</p>
<p>Several studies have recently been done on the practice of gratitude and its impact on sleep time and quality. A <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/minding-the-body/201111/how-gratitude-helps-you-sleep-night" target="_blank">study</a> in Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being, led by psychology professor Nancy Digdon of MacEwan University, found that writing in a gratitude journal for just 15 minutes before bedtime helped students decrease their anxiety and sleep both longer and better.</p>
<p>Another study at the University of Manchester in England was interested in the impact of gratitude on subject’s sleep quality and duration. This assessment included more than 400 adults (40% had sleep disorders). Researchers asked subjects to fill out questionnaires about gratitude, sleep, and “pre-sleep” thoughts. Gratitude was directly correlated to having more positive thoughts, and less of those nagging, ruminating negative, or anxious thoughts so many of us struggle with when the lights go out at the end of the day. This gratitude and positive-thought connection was directly related to subjects not only falling asleep faster, but experiencing higher quality rest.</p>
<h2>3. Boosted Physical Health</h2>
<p>Expressing gratitude can actually improve your physical health in more ways than one — think heart health, dietary behavior, kicking unhealthy habits, and exercise to name a few. According to Robert Emmons, a researcher and psychology professor at UC Davis, giving thanks on a routine basis can actually help you meet your exercise goals. In his <a href="http://emmons.faculty.ucdavis.edu/gratitude-and-well-being/" target="_blank">2003 study</a>, Emmons found that those who regularly and actively expressed feelings of gratitude by means of a daily journal, also engaged in more cardiovascular physical activity each week.</p>
<p>Additionally, Emmons identified that expressing gratitude can also improve eating habits and cut down on unhealthy habits like cigarette smoking and alcohol abuse. This outcome isn’t all that surprising. When we are at peace and grateful for what is abundant in our lives, we are less likely to self-medicate with potentially harmful substances.</p>
<p>To add to Emmons findings regarding gratitude and physical health, Psychology Today cited several studies that discovered people who report being more grateful also experience fewer aches and pains, and are more likely to visit doctor on a routine basis.</p>
<h2>4. Grateful People Have Stronger Relationships</h2>
<p>Gratitude is a nutrient that nourishes and deepens our close and intimate relationships. Quite a few recent studies found that gratitude can help deepen and maintain a relationship by promoting a cycle of generosity between partners. One person’s practice of expressing gratitude in the relationship can prompt the other partner to think and act in ways that helps them signal gratitude to each other. This dynamic promotes a desire to hold on to the relationship and a deepening of connection. On days when you are feeling more actively valued by your partner, you are more likely to feel an increase in your own gratitude toward your partner.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-6811.2010.01273.x/abstract" target="_blank">study</a> by the National Institute of Mental Health, participants who reported feelings of appreciation for their partners not only found more joy and contentment in their relationships, but were also more likely to be together nine months after the study took place than those who did not share these feelings of gratitude.</p>
<p>Many people may be quick to discard these benefits as simple by-products of happiness. People who are emotionally, mentally, and physically balanced tend to be more grateful in general, right?</p>
<p>Contrary to what many naysayers think, this isn’t necessarily the case. Many studies have shown that when people actively take part of their day to actually list the things for which they are grateful, they experience a higher quality of physical and mental health than those who have not done the same. The health benefits of gratitude are not simply correlational, but in many cases, causal.</p>
<p>It’s not always easy to remember to be grateful, especially because the human brain is so adaptable and susceptible to our immediate surroundings. Nonetheless, by making a few small shifts in your perspective, behaviors, and thought patterns, you may find that adopting an attitude of gratitude year-round can make for a healthier and happier life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all know (and hate) hangovers. A crazy night out drinking too much alcohol can lead to a slew of unpleasant symptoms the next morning. But did you know there’s another type of hangover that has absolutely nothing to do with drinking? You might wake up feeling drained, exhausted, moody, or a bit off&#8230;except, the night before wasn’t fun at all. In fact, it was quite the opposite! Welcome to the emotional hangover.</p>
<p>The idea is that the effects of an emotional event can linger for a while after the event actually happens — the same way nausea lingers long after you’ve consumed one too many tequila shots (whoops). This event can be anything from an argument with your best friend to a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/09/how-to-get-over-a-breakup/" target="_blank">break up</a> with your partner. While the event is over, your head is still reeling and messing with your current emotions.<span id="more-8379"></span></p>
<p>“Emotional hangover” isn’t just a silly term. <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2016/december/is-there-such-a-thing-as-an-emotional-hangover--nyu-researchers-.html" target="_blank">NYU researchers</a> have actually proved that the phenomenon exists with recent studies. The occurrence has to do with the way our brains process information to create and hold on to memories. The researchers had cold hard data — they measured participants’ skin conductance and watched brain activity via functional MRI.</p>
<p>After the study, associate professor Lila Davachi concluded, “How we remember events is not just a consequence of the external world we experience, but is also strongly influenced by our internal states — and these internal states can persist and color future experiences.” She adds, “These findings make clear that our cognition is highly influenced by preceding experiences and, specifically, that emotional brain states can persist for long periods of time.”</p>
<p>Recovering from an emotional hangover is all about self care. You should be <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/7-self-care-tips-for-when-stress-affects-your-body/" target="_blank">practicing self care</a> everyday, but now’s definitely the time to kick it into high gear. Here are some tips for getting out of your funk and back into the swing of things.</p>
<h2>1. Eat a Good Meal</h2>
<p>Avoid <a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/anxiety-pictures/anxiety-foods-that-help-foods-that-hurt-0118.aspx" target="_blank">food and drink that may trigger anxiety</a>, like candy, coffee and alcohol. While you might think turning to booze and having a drink would help ease your mind and get you to relax, you don’t want to mess with your brain chemicals when your mind is in this vulnerable state. Instead, load up on healthy foods that’ll nourish your body and your mind, like those leafy greens your mom was always trying to get you to eat when you were younger.</p>
<h2>2. Get Some Exercise</h2>
<p>Sweat out all that negativity! There’s so much evidence out there about <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/5-ways-exercise-is-great-for-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">how great exercise is for mental health</a>, so it’s time to get off our lazy bums. According to the <a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/12/exercise.aspx" target="_blank">American Psychological Association</a>, exercise can actually improve mood only five minutes into a moderate workout. Finding the motivation to work out is half the battle, so use this proof to motivate you to get active and get your brain back to a better place. Whether your exercise of choice is yoga or running, get moving!</p>
<h2>3. Write in a Journal</h2>
<p>Put your thoughts down in a notebook&#8230;or even in the app on your phone if you’re on the go. If your mind is still reeling and replaying the event over and over, it helps to write it down and see it all on paper. Getting everything out on paper will help you distance yourself from it. Also, journaling can help you make sense of feelings you’re having when it’s too difficult to keep track of spiraling thoughts. If you go to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/02/talkspace-reviews-experiences-help-decide-right/" target="_blank">therapy</a>, it can be super beneficial to have a written record to reference so you don’t forget what to bring up to your <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/talkspace-online-therapy-licensed-ecounseling/id661829386?mt=8" target="_blank">therapist</a>! And <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/" target="_blank">online therapy</a> makes it even easier.</p>
<h2>4. Spend Time With Loved Ones</h2>
<p>It doesn’t help to keep your feelings bottled up! It can feel absolutely amazing to get something you’ve been holding in off your chest. Vent to friends and family members you can trust about what’s going on. Preferably, you’ll be able to talk to someone who will be supportive and not judgmental. Expressing your emotions and verbalizing them to somebody else can allow you to gain new perspective and get advice. Plus, spending quality time with loved ones is a mood booster, in general.</p>
<h2>5. Channel Your Creativity</h2>
<p>Put your emotions to good use. Instead of just hating on the event you’re reliving, use your memory for good to create something — anything. You don’t have to be Picasso! Paint, draw, write a poem, strum a guitar, whatever you feel like! Do what feels good for you. Focus on letting it be an outlet for your energy, rather than a challenge to create something perfect. You can even just color in a coloring book.</p>
<p>Unlike an alcohol hangover, it’s kind of impossible to avoid these bad boys — unless you plan on completely avoiding life (and let’s be real, that’s not possible). But now, next time you’re feeling emotionally hungover, you’ll know exactly what’s happening and how to cope. It’s normal, it’s science, and it’s just your brain doing its job! Bring it on, life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most days, I work from home, alone. I also often travel alone. Solitude is a central part of my everyday existence. Yet I am not lonely.</p>
<p>Working alone doesn’t meant I don’t collaborate. I schedule virtual and in-person meetings with team members and clients.</p>
<p>Traveling alone is less of a sentence to isolation and more of an opportunity to connect with strangers and welcome unexpected encounters into my journey. It also offers more freedom and flexibility than traveling with others.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s much written about our culture of distraction, but there’s too little discussion of the value of time spent truly alone. We largely fear it and cling to the pings and prods from our personal devices to keep us in constant company.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. Connection still matters. It is an important indicator of health and happiness. <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1745691614568352" target="_blank">Studies</a> indicate that social isolation is more dangerous to your health than obesity, increasing your risk of premature death by more than 14%.</p>
<p>But quality alone time does not indicate loneliness. Celebrating solitude doesn’t condemn connection.<span id="more-6003"></span></p>
<h2>Why Is Alone Time So Crucial?</h2>
<p>For introverts alone time is crucial to recharging . But everyone, even extroverts, benefits mentally from regular intervals spent alone. Think of constant social interaction — be it in-person or digital — as your brain running on a treadmill. It needs to take periodic breathers. When we burnout, we are useless to others and ourselves.</p>
<p>Groupthink, the psychological phenomenon when groups overconform and stop thinking as individuals, is largely a result of too much togetherness. Creative brainstorming is most effective when initially conducted solo, with collaboration to follow after those initial seeds of creativity and problem-solving are planted. But more often than not we feel compelled to air all of our ideas publically from inception. Because of our fear of rejection of “bad” ideas, this discourages the breadth of our creative potential.</p>
<p>Alone time has largely become taboo in our always-on, always-connected culture. But solitude clears our heads, gives us focus, and recharges our bodies. It also centers us and creates clarity. Distraction is the nemesis of clarity, so consider solitude your tool for sanity and clear vision. Solitude helps us to reconnect with who we are and who we want to become. In turn, this enhances our relationships and what we can offer those we love and encounter.</p>
<p>For those with families, alone time might seem like a scarce commodity or feel selfish. But once you realize you are actually more valuable to the people in your life if you periodically disengage from them, it becomes much easier to prioritize and give yourself permission.</p>
<p>How can you create more alone time? Here are three easy, immediately accessible ways you can implement alone time into your life starting today:</p>
<h2>1. Unplug</h2>
<p>I encourage all my clients to turn their phones off while they sleep. Not on silent or “do not disturb,” but completely off. It allows you to be off-duty and avoid temptation to check messages or emails — to truly disconnect. Remember that digitally-distracted interactions are different than intimate, empathic conversations.</p>
<p>Bring that unplugged mentality to your individual encounters. Being truly alone with someone is one of the greatest gifts you can give.</p>
<h2>2. Schedule Dates With Yourself</h2>
<p>One of my favorite pastimes is to go to the movies by myself. I slip into an alternate reality where I don’t need to be social or productive. My mind wanders and my body relaxes. I emerge recharged and ready to re-engage with the world.</p>
<p>It’s also a way to take back control — to do what you want, how you want to do it. When we feel a sense of agency, we are happier. Your solo date might be a surf session or a hike in the woods, or perhaps it’s getting lost in a book. Whatever it is, schedule it, make it purposeful, and indulge regularly.</p>
<h2>3. Actively Reflect</h2>
<p>Sometimes we need to formally recognize the benefit of something before we can prioritize it. Identity the ways you want to spend your alone time — in nature, unplugged from technology, or lost in a creative pursuit — and actively reflect on how you feel before and after.</p>
<p>Perhaps you freewrite about your week after implementing these experiments. Or perhaps it’s only a 10-minute meditation session where you feel the difference in your mind and body. Using whatever method most resonates with you, take a few moments to recognize the feedback and results of your efforts, and use that to fuel your commitment to regular alone time.</p>
<p>By taking control of your time, and prioritizing time by yourself, you’ll be more productive and better connect with friends, family, and colleagues when together.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good mental health is both a state of mind and a lifestyle. Part of it is developing a rational, positive mindset about oneself and the world. Having sources of pleasure and a manageable level of stress facilitates good mental health as well.</p>
<p>Additionally, it’s important to have a lifestyle that helps maintain this state of mind. This goes beyond fulfillment in work and relationships. It’s about regularly engaging in activities that provide a sense of peace or catharsis, including being in nature, meditating, or <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_BOTTOM&amp;utr_adgroup=bottom-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=5895" target="_blank">working with a therapist</a>.</p>
<p>By practicing good mental health, people become more resilient and able to cope when their lives are riddled with stress and misfortune.</p>
<p>“Practicing good mental health habits before you feel distressed is like putting money in the bank for the bad times,” said <a href="http://judemillerburke.com/" target="_blank">Jude Miller Burke</a>, Ph.D., a business psychologist and author of <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Adversity-Advantage-Childhood-Hardship-Success/dp/1939548675" target="_blank">The Adversity Advantage</a></em>. “When a bad time then comes, you are more prepared.”</p>
<p>If you feel like you’re missing a positive mindset or healthy lifestyle, try out some of the tips we gathered by asking therapists how to practice good mental health.<span id="more-5895"></span></p>
<h2>1. Work With a Therapist</h2>
<p>Big surprise: therapists suggested going to therapy as their top tip for improving mental health. It’s still a useful tip, though. Therapy can improve quality of life and reduce symptoms of mental illness — among many other benefits — according to <a href="http://www.apa.org/about/policy/resolution-psychotherapy.aspx" target="_blank">hundreds of studies</a>.</p>
<p>Working with a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a> is like having a coach who constantly helps and pushes you to maintain good mental health. Throughout a relationship with a therapist, clients can set specific and actionable mental health goals. These can range from developing new thought patterns to implementing healthy lifestyle changes. If trauma, toxic relationships, mental illness, or negative beliefs are holding you back from having a positive state of mind, working with a therapist might be especially helpful.</p>
<h2>2. Try Mindfulness and Meditation</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5754 alignright" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/woman-tea-senses-feature_600W_JR-1-300x200.jpg" alt="woman tea meditation" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/woman-tea-senses-feature_600W_JR-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/woman-tea-senses-feature_600W_JR-1.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Mindfulness practices can reduce negative rumination and stress, and improve relationship satisfaction, according to a <a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/07-08/ce-corner.aspx" target="_blank">meta analysis of studies on the mental health benefits of mindfulness</a>. Here are some <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/finding-inner-peace-mindfulness-5-senses/" target="_blank">examples of practicing mindfulness and meditation</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mindfulness-based therapy</li>
<li>Tea meditation</li>
<li><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/07/city-dwellers-embrace-the-healing-power-of-nature/" target="_blank">Being in nature</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/03/how-you-can-beat-anxiety-with-mindful-breathing/" target="_blank">Mindful breathing</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can practice mindfulness in many other ways. <a href="https://twitter.com/lisa_bahar" target="_blank">Therapist Lisa Bahar</a> recommended incorporating mindfulness into routine activities we tend to take for granted. Think about the last time you ate something that tasted good, maybe an expensive dessert. Were you in the moment when you ate it? Were you present, only thinking about the taste of the food and the experience of eating it?</p>
<h2>3. Exercise Regularly</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/5-ways-exercise-is-great-for-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">Physical activity can boost mental health</a> and reduce symptoms of mental illness, according to a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470658/" target="_blank">wealth of research</a>. It releases chemicals that bolster well-being on a neurological level.</p>
<p>When people exercise, it’s as if some of their anxiety, depression, and stress transforms into sweat. Rather than festering in their bodies, it slides off.</p>
<h2>4. Have a Healthy Diet</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5901 alignright" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/healthy-foods-secondary_1320W_JR-1-300x200.png" alt="healthy foods spread" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/healthy-foods-secondary_1320W_JR-1-300x200.png 300w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/healthy-foods-secondary_1320W_JR-1-768x512.png 768w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/healthy-foods-secondary_1320W_JR-1-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/healthy-foods-secondary_1320W_JR-1.png 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Each piece of food and glass of liquid we drink affects our mental health. The effects are small, but they can add up as part of a healthy diet. For example, certain types of diets can help people manage depression, according to a <a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-017-0791-y" target="_blank">study</a> published in BMC Medicine.</p>
<p>Here are some supplements, beverages, and vitamins that can help you have good mental health:</p>
<ul>
<li>Herbal supplements: GABA, kava, passion flower, L-theanine, lemon balm</li>
<li>Non-caffeinated tea</li>
<li>Vitamin B, magnesium, vitamin D3, omega-3 [fish oil]</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider conducting further research or consulting a nutritionist for help incorporating these into a diet.</p>
<h2>5. Be Grateful</h2>
<p>When people take what they have for granted, it’s like they are placing constraints on how happy they can be. Gratitude helps us enjoy our privileges, the people in our lives, and material possessions. It’s a way to be free of constraints on how much happiness we can derive from what we have.</p>
<p>Gratitude is something you can practice by regularly taking time to run through a list of what you have and why you appreciate it. This will make you more likely to foster fulfilling relationships, sleep well, and feel well physically, among <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/what-mentally-strong-people-dont-do/201504/7-scientifically-proven-benefits-gratitude" target="_blank">other benefits</a>.</p>
<h2>6. Laugh A Lot</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5902 alignright" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/woman-laughing-secondary_1320W_JR-1-300x200.png" alt="woman laughing" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/woman-laughing-secondary_1320W_JR-1-300x200.png 300w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/woman-laughing-secondary_1320W_JR-1-768x512.png 768w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/woman-laughing-secondary_1320W_JR-1-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/woman-laughing-secondary_1320W_JR-1.png 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.yalescientific.org/2011/05/can-laughter-be-therapeutic/" target="_blank">Laughter can be therapeutic</a>. Every time we laugh, our brains release dopamine, a chemical that makes us feel happy. If you’re missing some laughter in your life, try going to a comedy club, binge watching a new comedy series, or checking out some standup specials on Netflix.</p>
<h2>7. Sing Your Heart Out</h2>
<p>Even if it’s only in the shower, singing will make you feel good. The <a href="http://ideas.time.com/2013/08/16/singing-changes-your-brain/" target="_blank">musical vibrations literally change the brain</a> for the better by lowering levels of hormones that typically indicate stress.</p>

<p>Even introverts and people with social anxiety need at least a little social interaction to be mentally healthy, according to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3150158/" target="_blank">studies on social relationships and health</a>. Having relationships or simply chatting with people occasionally can make a huge difference.</p>
<p>If you are missing a degree of social interaction, consider joining one of the following communities and groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>An activist group related to a cause you care about</li>
<li>A networking, professional, or meetup group based on a common skill or interest</li>
<li>A religious community</li>
<li>A form of group exercise, including team sports</li>
<li>Group therapy</li>
</ul>

<p>Volunteering can improve mental and physical health, according to <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/pag/28/2/578" target="_blank">research</a> from Carnegie Mellon University. The satisfaction of doing something for other people is invaluable. It can also be an opportunity to practice gratefulness.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of opportunities for volunteering. If you want something guaranteed to improve your mental health, <a href="http://www.therapywithkeeley.com/" target="_blank">therapist Keeley Teemsma</a> recommended volunteering with an animal rescue or shelter.</p>
<p>“Spending time with animals, giving love, getting love, and knowing they appreciate your actions — even though they don&#8217;t have the words to express how they feel — always feels amazing,” she said.</p>
<h2>10. Know Your Personality and What You Love</h2>
<p>When people know who they are and what they love, it’s easier to for them to find sources of good mental health. Burke offered the example of an introvert reading a book and having alone time as opposed to an extrovert needing stimulation from others.</p>
<p>“Choosing activities that correlate with your personality traits helps retain a mental health balance,” she said.</p>
<p>If you’re struggling to think of activities to try, Burke recommended thinking back to your childhood. Those memories might contain clues to what could bring happiness as an adult.</p>
<h2>11. Challenge Negative Thoughts and Self-Criticism</h2>
<p>All of us have some negative thoughts about ourselves, other people, or even the nature of the world. When these inevitably occur, ask yourself, “Is this line of thinking fair? Is it logical?”</p>
<p>Negative beliefs are often irrational and flimsy. When we challenge them, we can replace them with positive beliefs that boost mental health. If you have trouble doing this alone, consider working with a licensed therapist.</p>
<h2>12. Think About What You Want, Not What You <em>Should</em> Be Doing</h2>
<p>“Should” is about placating other people. That won’t bring happiness or peace.</p>
<p>Try to constantly think about what you want. Put your desires first and worry about the “should” later. Even if you can’t always do what you want, simply asking yourself is part of practicing good mental health, according to therapist Steve Sultanoff.</p>
<h2>How to Practice Good Mental Health</h2>
<p>If you try even one of these tips, you’ll be practicing good mental health. To feel even better, start adding more of them to your lifestyle and see what fits. Good mental health can become part of who you are and what you do, not only something you obtain.</p>
