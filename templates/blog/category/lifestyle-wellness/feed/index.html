				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever become spiteful after hearing about someone else’s accomplishments, and felt like a complete jerk? Maybe you’ve felt your heart sink a little bit when someone shares their own good news in the form of an “I’m so excited to announce&#8230;” Facebook or Instagram post. Chances are, yes, you’ve felt a little terrible at least once when you’ve watched someone’s success from the sidelines. You find yourself looking at your phone, feeling like a failure, even though you’re not!</p>
<p><span id="more-11118"></span></p>
<p>This doesn’t make you a hateful monster — it just makes you human. In fact, the phenomenon is is pretty common. It’s human nature for us to compare ourselves to others, and it’s no surprise that sometimes, that results in jealousy and feeling lousy.</p>
<h2>Understanding Jealousy Around Others’ Success</h2>
<p>It’s possible that people around you are doing amazing things, and even if you are too, you might still feel that jealousy running through your veins.</p>
<p>“At times, we can experience this tendency to compare ourselves to others, which can result in a sense of ‘I’m not enough’,” explains Rachel O’Neill, Ph.D. “To some extent, that tendency to both self-compare, as well as to feel inadequate, is natural. It becomes complicated when individuals start to feel bad about feeling inadequate or jealous.”</p>
<p>You should be happy for your friend who just got that promotion at work, not feel crappy about it, right? Well, not always, and that doesn’t necessarily mean that you love them or care about them any less. It’s simply an emotional reaction! Our brains are programmed into the pattern of comparing ourselves to others, and it’s a hard cycle to break. You see someone around you accomplishing big things, and you automatically check in with how you measure up.</p>
<p>25 year old artist, Kara,* has a tendency to compare herself to her longtime group of friends. “I feel behind in a lot of ways, so it literally feels like a race. I need to catch up to my friends. I can’t move out like everyone else because I don’t have a job because I was in school for so long,” Kara* confides. “It’s hard when you and your friends are all the same age, all had the same start in high school, and since then, their lives look like how you want yours to look.”</p>
<p><a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/online-therapy-with-a-licensed-therapist?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_MID&amp;utr_content=affordable&amp;utr_adgroup=midpost-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=3061&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/10/why-sometimes-other-peoples-accomplishments-make-you-feel-terrible/&amp;var=promo-b&amp;partner=Talkspace%20Blog&amp;code=BLOG45" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4880 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png" alt="affordable blog purchase CTA" width="660" height="240" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png 660w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a></p>
<h2>Comparing Yourself to a Significant Other or Potential Partner</h2>
<p>Aside from comparing yourself to your friends, you might find yourself checking how you stack up to your other half. Hannah,* 29, who works in fashion, says, “It can be difficult dating someone who’s recently had a lot of success. My boyfriend is only one year older than me, and seems wildly more successful, or at least he’s pursuing his passion, when most days I have no idea what my passion is.”</p>
<p>Rachel,* 28, who works at a non-profit, shares the sentiment of feeling inadequate compared to a significant other. “He&#8217;s about a year older than me but it just felt like we should be on par with each other, especially since we were living together, sharing costs, and everything,” she says of her boyfriend. “I couldn&#8217;t understand why I wasn&#8217;t succeeding like he was, why I wasn&#8217;t in a job that felt like it offered a path forward, and why I wasn&#8217;t making more money. I felt totally insufficient.”</p>
<h2>How to Calm Your Jealousy and Improve Self-Esteem</h2>
<p>All three of these people are taking blows to their self esteem and self worth as they compare themselves to their friends, coworkers, and significant others. People with low self esteem are more likely to take offense to others’ <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/how-setting-micro-goals-can-increase-happiness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accomplishments</a>. However, with practice, you can get better at comparing yourself to others less often and build higher confidence. Additionally, you can learn to better understand and recognize your emotions. Plus, you have to remember that it’s totally okay to feel!</p>
<p>“Instead of focusing on stopping the emotion, focus instead on identifying what you’re feeling and giving yourself some space to simply feel it. It’s okay to experience feelings of jealousy or inadequacy in the face of other’s success,” O’Neil assures. But if your comparisons are really taking a toll on you, there are some actions you can take.</p>
<p>“Take some time to evaluate what it is that you want to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/why-successful-people-struggle-with-mental-illness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">achieve</a> in your life. This can be a great opportunity to journal or write down your intentions. Further, instead of focusing on others’ achievements, focus on what you’re grateful for in your life,” Rachel O’Neil suggests. “Lastly, to the extent possible, try to limit your social media use, especially during times when you find yourself especially vulnerable to self-comparison.”</p>
<p>So, next time you hear someone’s big news, remember it’s okay to feel some negative emotions — you’re definitely not the only one feeling them! With practice and confidence, you’ll be able to enjoy others’ successes more, and celebrate your own as well! And hey, being more <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/5-ways-improve-body-image-confidence-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self confident</a> is a success, in my book.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bloating. Headaches. Moodiness. These symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) are well known, likely because more than<a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/menstrual-cycle/premenstrual-syndrome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> 90 percent of women</a> experience at least one symptom before their monthly cycle. But for some women, the symptoms go beyond minor discomfort and a feeling of being off.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell everybody, &#8216;I&#8217;m not myself right now. I&#8217;ll call you back when I&#8217;m Ronna again,&#8221; one woman was quoted as saying on<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/10/22/223805027/should-disabling-premenstrual-symptoms-be-a-mental-disorder" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> National Public Radio</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-10790"></span></p>
<p>Ronna, like<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/9132-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder-pmdd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> three to five percent</a> of menstruating women, suffers from premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a severe, often disabling extension of PMS. How is it different?<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/premenstrual-syndrome/expert-answers/pmdd/faq-20058315" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> According to the Mayo Clinic</a>, women with PMDD usually battle at least one prominent emotional and behavioral symptom:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sadness or hopelessness</li>
<li><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">Anxiety</a> or tension</li>
<li>Extreme moodiness</li>
<li>Marked irritability or anger</li>
</ul>
<p>While often viewed as a primarily physical experience, PMS and the more severe PMDD prove that your periods each month can have an impact on your mental health. Here’s why.</p>
<h2>The Hormonal Link Between PMS, PMDD, and Mental Health</h2>
<p>For both PMS and PMDD, the exact cause is unknown, but most researchers agree that PMDD is related to the hormonal changes that correspond with the menstrual cycle. According to the<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/9132-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder-pmdd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Cleveland Clinic</a>, studies have shown a connection between PMDD and low levels of serotonin, a chemical in the brain that helps transmit nerve signals. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/ways-stomach-microbiome-impacts-mental-health/" target="_blank">Changes in serotonin levels</a> can contribute to PMDD systems since serotonin helps control mood, sleep, and pain.</p>
<p>While underlying depression and anxiety are common in both PMS and PMDD, the hormonal changes that trigger a menstrual period can worsen the symptoms of mood disorders. Relationships can suffer from the emotional symptoms of depression, anxiety, and irritability, leading to additional stressors on mental and emotional health.</p>
<h2>How These Symptoms Mimic Depression</h2>
<p>Intricately woven into the current state of your mental health, PMDD symptoms mimic those of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/what-is-crippling-depression/">major depression</a>. This means that women suffering from PMDD also take on the risks of major depression, like an increased risk of suicide during the two weeks they are affected. For women who have a personal or family history of mood disorders — including major depression or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/postpartum-depression-a-quick-guide-for-tired-new-moms/" target="_blank">postpartum depression</a> — they’re at a greater risk for developing PMDD to begin with. Unlike major depression, however, PMDD symptoms lessen or go away at the start of your period.</p>
<p>The reverse effect is also true. Mental health conditions in general<a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health/living-mental-health-condition/reproductive-health-and-mental-health" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> can cause period problems</a> or make some period problems worse. Studies show that women with anxiety disorder or substance use disorder are more likely to have shorter menstrual cycles. Irregular cycles are also linked to eating disorders and depression, and women with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/knew-bipolar-disorder-not-depression/" target="_blank">bipolar disorder</a> are twice as likely to have irregular periods.</p>
<h2>Genetic and Environmental Risk Factors</h2>
<p>Some women may be more at risk than others, with physicians considering both environmental and genetic<a href="https://psychcentral.com/blog/pmdd-is-not-just-normal-moodiness/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> risk factors</a> during the diagnostic process. Stress, a history of interpersonal trauma, seasonal changes, and socio-cultural aspects can impact the development of PMDD. It’s unknown if PMDD is hereditary, but PMS symptoms are: 30 to 80 percent of women who suffer from PMS indicate that other women in their family suffer, as well.</p>
<p>A<a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/psych/wmd/mood-disorders/menstrually-related" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> large percentage of women</a> seeking treatment for PMDD — 40 percent — actually have an underlying mood disorder, so it’s important to undergo a careful evaluation to ensure you receive the best treatment.</p>
<h2>A Recognized Disorder</h2>
<p>Just like other mental health disorders,<a href="https://womensmentalhealth.org/specialty-clinics/pms-and-pmdd/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> there’s hope for women</a> experiencing PMDD. Lifestyle modifications like eliminating caffeine and sugar, decreasing alcohol use, and getting enough sleep can help address the symptoms.</p>
<p><a href="https://womensmentalhealth.org/posts/nutritional-supplements-for-premenstrual-syndrome-do-they-work/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nutritional supplements</a> like Vitamin B6 can help women with PMS, while some evidence points to the effectiveness of magnesium and Vitamin E. Herbal therapies and light therapy represent two other options with psychotherapy and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-how-is-it-conducted-online/" target="_blank">Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</a> also offering a non-pharmacologic approach to treatment.</p>
<p>Medications ranging from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to benzodiazepines and hormonal interventions may also be effective options.</p>
<p>There’s more good news for these women. After<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/millennial-media/201202/the-inclusion-pmdd-in-dsm-5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> years of petitioning</a> by researchers and advocates, PMDD is now included in the latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). As a<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3462360/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> new category</a>, this provide greater legitimacy for the disorder, which will hopefully lead to new research and treatments based on a recognized connection between periods and mental health.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days actor/comedian/speaker/life coach/talent manager <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0739479/?ref_=vi_md_ti" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kate Romero</a> has a full and happy life. It wasn’t always that way.</p>
<p>After a difficult childhood that included surviving many traumas, Romero found herself across the table from another deadbeat boyfriend. With several drinks under his belt, he and Romero headed out to their van and took off into the early morning. It was the beginning of a life-changing event for Romero.</p>
<p><span id="more-10649"></span></p>
<p>“He got agitated reaching for a cigarette and inadvertently drove us off a cliff,” Romero says of what happened next. “Our van rolled some 11 times down the cliff to crash on the canyon floor under a full moon. While airborne, I felt weightless spinning between the two bucket seats. It was surreal.”</p>
<p>Romero managed to claw her way back up the cliff, where she stopped breathing while lying on the side of the road. She felt herself floating 25 feet above the scene, observing. Paramedics attempted to resuscitate her while onlookers and her still-drunk boyfriend cried. She was declared dead. But, in the ambulance, as her boyfriend rode with her body from the scene, a miracle happened — she woke up.</p>
<h2>Heeding our Wake-Up Calls</h2>
<p>For Romero, her near death experience was a wake-up call in more ways than one. Her word for it is “freedom.” Like others who have survived near death experiences, her perspective on life has never been the same, and for good reason.</p>
<p>“Near death experiences have us come face to face with our own mortality,” New York-based psychotherapist and coach <a href="http://janetzinn.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Janet Zinn</a> tells Talkspace. “Once someone has confronted possible death, it gives them perspective on the value of life in general.”</p>
<p>We talked to three people who have faced down death and one mental health expert, and these are five of the psychological secrets they shared.</p>
<h3>1. Cherish Love</h3>
<p>One of the biggest awakenings for Romero was the importance of nurturing love in her life, a lesson that’s a good reminder for all of us. At the end of the day, love is the most powerful force we have.</p>
<p>“All there really is in the world is love, as corny as that might sound,” Romero says. “That&#8217;s what makes up everything.”</p>
<p>Take the time to cherish those who provide unconditional love, and don’t settle for anything less. And, like Romero — now happily married after ditching the boyfriend who nearly killed her years ago — make sure to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/toxic-love-looking-back-at-the-relationship-that-almost-broke-me/" target="_blank">give love only to those who deserve it</a>.</p>
<p>“Those who have faced near death experiences&#8230;can also more readily dismiss relationships that don’t serve them,” says Zinn. “For instance, given the lesson that time is dear, they don’t want to engage in superficial relationships, and are apt to let go of those ‘friendships.’”</p>
<h3>2. Find What Matters</h3>
<p>There’s nothing like the scare of death to find perspective on what truly matters in life. Take time to look hard at your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/02/self-awareness-will-make-your-life-better-heres-how-to-get-it/" target="_blank">values</a> and put those into practice, because we’re only on the planet for a limited amount of time. Make it count.</p>
<p>“One example of this was a client who was in medical school because all her life she was told how smart she was and that she should go into medicine, but her real love was teaching,” Zinn shares. “She&#8230;<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/how-staying-in-a-job-you-hate-affects-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">shifted her career course</a>, much to the chagrin of her family, to education following a major car accident. She is so happy in her career, and she can’t imagine doing anything else.”</p>
<p>Facing down death brings our emotional self back to center and removes the mindless hum we so often get caught up in. If we tap into these feelings, we may find a wealth of resources we didn’t know we had.</p>
<p>“We are more vulnerable and can feel things fully following a near death experience,” says Zinn. “This brings us closer to our feelings. That sensitivity allows us to harness our own strength in making changes in our lives.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Appreciate The Small Things</h3>
<p>Learning to appreciate the small moments in life is said so often it borders on cliche. But before you dismiss the idea, consider that often it really is the little things that matter most to us, like a handwritten letter from a grandmother or a shared laugh over a good cup of coffee. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/12-best-ways-spend-mental-health-day-according-therapist/" target="_blank">Slow down</a>, because if we’re not paying attention, we’ll miss these precious memories.</p>
<p>“When you have an experience, everything slows down,” shares <a href="http://www.mattersofspirit.com/index.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Josiane Antonette</a>, who survived her own near death experience. “Everything is in a different place and you have the time to really appreciate….You&#8217;re sensing things in a different way.”</p>
<p>This is a lesson that Michele Smith, CEO of <a href="http://www.mcommunicationsinc.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M Communications</a>, also learned after a harrowing <a href="http://www.folsomtelegraph.com/article/4/27/17/el-dorado-hills-couple-rescued-boat-wreck-sea" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">boating accident</a> that put her and her partner’s lives in grave danger.</p>
<p>“You realize that life is short,” Smith tells Talkspace. “You appreciate each and every day — this includes appreciating the small things like a sunrise to a thank you note.”</p>
<h3>4. Acknowledge Shared Connections</h3>
<p>One of Josiane Antonette’s most powerful revelations is acknowledging our shared connections as humans. When we can stand in our sameness, we benefit both those around us and ourselves.</p>
<p>“Everybody&#8217;s the same,” says Antonette. “It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re rich, poor, black, white, nobody…If we learn that, then we can stand in another place in life and realize I will do my best to grow.”</p>
<p>To do this, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/04/5-ways-to-practice-mindfulness-everyday/" target="_blank">be present</a>. Be present in relationships, in brief interactions with strangers, and be present to witness the beauty we all inherently carry within us. We share this world, and those bonds transcend any artificial barriers we try to create. Life is so much more than the “rat race.”</p>
<p>“Really be present — be there and share whatever you have learned in life,” advises Antonette. “Help people right here, and then help them to understand that there&#8217;s a bigger picture.”</p>
<h3>5. Learn Self-Acceptance</h3>
<p>Finally, accept yourself completely. Life is precious, yours included. Just as Romero’s accident served as her wake-up call to appreciate her self-worth, we all deserve to find inner acceptance and self-love.</p>
<p>“Respect yourself, because you are so beautiful,” says Antonette. “You cannot put yourself in places where you can be abused because you&#8217;re too beautiful. Once you know your beauty, you don&#8217;t allow yourself to go there.”</p>
<p>True <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/5-ways-improve-body-image-confidence-mental-health/" target="_blank">self-acceptance</a> includes cherishing love, pursuing what truly matters, finding joy in even the smallest moments, and seeking out shared human connections. Our link to each other runs deep and know that when we take care of ourselves, we give others permission to do the same. We lift each other up.</p>
<p>“This planet is made for us to learn from each other,” Antonette says. “We came here to learn and to be together.”</p>
<h2>You’re Not Alone</h2>
<p>Taken as a whole, the biggest psychological secret may be the willingness to see ourselves reflected in another’s eyes.</p>
<p>We’re not alone in this world. We’re not so different from each other in the end, and it’s embracing and growing from our shared humanity that will make the time we have left matter.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all face hard circumstances from time to time. Sometimes life throws us new responsibilities or burdens, and expects us to just roll with the punches. That can be quite difficult, especially when you’re already managing a mental illness. The good news is that we can have a plan when those unexpected hard times come up. Here are some recommendations for a mental health workout plan when you need help to weather hard times.</p>
<p><span id="more-9959"></span></p>
<h2>About the Mind Body Connection</h2>
<p>Many of us now know that the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1456909/">mind and body are inextricably linked</a>. One does not function well without the other. Emotions and stressful circumstances affect your body as well as your mind. This connection has been well documented in research, and is the reason why many <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">providers</a>, like myself, incorporate a holistic approach to mental health treatment. The mind-body connection continues to gain more recognition in the medical community, which will help this understanding gain more mainstream recognition over time.</p>
<h2>Start With an Opening Stretch</h2>
<p>One of the best things that you can do for yourself in the morning is to stretch out, even before you officially start your day. When you struggle with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/what-is-crippling-depression/" target="_blank">depression</a> or a mental health condition that leaves you feeling fatigued, it can be hard to undertake even the smallest of steps towards self-care like getting out of bed or taking a shower. When you stretch, even for as little as ten minutes, you help <a href="https://healthyliving.azcentral.com/can-stretching-increase-persons-energy-level-10436.html" rel="nofollow">awaken your system and muscles and improve blood circulation</a>.</p>
<p>Stretching will also help you feel more alive, limber, and capable. And if you deal with ongoing physical aches and pains, which can often exacerbate depression, then stretching is going to help alleviate some of that discomfort. As you might imagine this can go a long way in helping you feel better in the moment. That moment may be the inspiration you need to make better choices to take care of yourself throughout the rest of the day. Try these <a href="https://fitnessista.com/afternoon-energizing-stretch/" rel="nofollow">energising stretches</a> to get your blood moving and help redirect your energy.</p>
<h2>Take a Few Minutes to Breathe</h2>
<p>If you’re often feeling anxious or keyed up, you can also incorporate some mindful breathing into your mental health workout plan. Deep diaphragmatic breathing has been shown to <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/relaxation-techniques-breath-control-helps-quell-errant-stress-response" rel="nofollow">reduce stress and help induce relaxation</a>. This practice helps engage the parasympathetic nervous system which is responsible for your calm physiological state.</p>
<p>By intentionally practicing mindful breathing, you can help direct your body to relaxation. As a bonus, mindful breathing will also help increase your immune system response, making you less susceptible to illness. You can use <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/03/how-you-can-beat-anxiety-with-mindful-breathing/">this practice</a> for 10-20 minutes per day as a part of your workout, or as a stand-alone way to address anxiety.</p>
<h2>Throw Around Some Barbells</h2>
<p>While most of us are familiar with the <a href="http://www.osteopathic.org/osteopathic-health/about-your-health/health-conditions-library/general-health/Pages/yoga.aspx" rel="nofollow">benefits of yoga</a> and running for mental health symptom management, there is emerging research in the realm of resistance training (or weight-lifting). Lifting weights has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing anxiety in those living with mental illness (and non-diagnosed folks too).</p>
<p>At this point in your mental health work out, drop in a few reps of bicep curls or over-the-head arm presses, which will help engage your core and practice diaphragmatic breathing. The exertion will change hormone production resulting in the <a href="https://fitness.mercola.com/sites/fitness/archive/2016/01/29/exercise-endorphins-happiness.aspx" rel="nofollow">release or production of “feel good” chemicals</a>. The research indicates that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40279-017-0769-0" rel="nofollow">it doesn’t matter much what specific resistance exercises you do</a>, so if barbells aren’t your thing, try other weightlifting exercises to better manage your mood.</p>
<h2>Finish Like a Superhero</h2>
<p>As you near the end of your mental health workout routine, take a minute to appreciate your achievement by ending with the superhero pose. Research has indicated that holding powerful poses helps reduce the spiking of the stress hormone cortisol, leaving you feeling more grounded and more at ease. In essence, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-superheroes/201107/why-you-may-want-stand-superhero" rel="nofollow">when you stand like a superhero you feel like one.</a> It’s the perfect way to end your workout and go out back into tackling the challenges of the world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of us are familiar with the idea of doctors prescribing medications for health issues. In recent years a newer trend called microdosing has emerged to help people cope with health conditions but in a different way, with different kinds of substances.</p>
<p><span id="more-9908"></span></p>
<h2>What is Microdosing?</h2>
<p>When your doctor prescribes you a medication, the dosage indicates how much of that particular drug you are to take and how often you should do so. This formula is based on the substances or chemicals of the medication and is designed in a way to help you gain the most benefit from the treatment, while hopefully limiting its potential negative impact. Prescriptions take into account your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/08/8-ways-to-make-the-most-of-counseling/" target="_blank">treatment goals</a> (like improving mood, for instance), and make a recommendation based on those factors as well as other physical considerations like your age, weight, etc.</p>
<p>Microdosing is similar in that its purpose to help you gain the most benefit from a particular substance. The main difference is that microdosing most often applies to illegal or recreational drugs for medicinal purposes. The premise is to consume the drug to gain its healing properties while attempting to avoid getting “high” and other negative consequences.</p>
<p>There has been some support for microdosing and its ability to help those in need, but the results are from very small studies and rely heavily on personal stories. Nonetheless, it does work for some, and the science works similarly to traditional medications. In some instances these small studies show that microdosing with <a href="https://thethirdwave.co/microdosing/mushrooms/#what-is-psilocybin-mushroom-microdosing" target="_blank"> substances like LSD or psilocybin work more effectively </a> than antidepressant medications.</p>
<p>Typically, microdosing (as the name suggests) means that you would consume a very small amount of the substance that one might normally consume for recreational use. Most often this amount would be physically out of your perception, meaning that you would not consume a dose at a high enough level to feel intoxicated or “high.” This might mean taking an amount as little as 1/10 of a recreational dose on a regular schedule, perhaps daily.</p>
<p>Drugs like LSD or magic mushrooms are among the first substances experimented with in this way, largely due to the personal exploration of psychologist Dr. James Fadiman. He also authored a hallmark text on experimentation with substances called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Psychedelic-Explorers-Guide-Therapeutic/dp/1594774021" target="_blank"> The Psychedelic Explorer&#8217;s Guide: Safe, Therapeutic, and Sacred Journeys</a>.</p>
<h2>The Use of Non-Traditional Therapies in Treatment</h2>
<p>Microdosing is a controversial and provocative discussion in the medical field. It&#8217;s very existence challenges the notion of continued investment in traditional medication. Some see using traditional “party” or street drugs in treatment as as a moral issue. Many others, such as researchers and scientists hope to find the best substances to treat common health problems, regardless of the substance’s origins. As such, many investigators believe that substances like LSD or ketamine has a place in the treatment of many mental health issues.</p>
<p>Ketamine, also known as the party drug “Special K,” is a sedative medication that has been used in the medical community for years for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4258981/" target="_blank"> anesthesia and pain management </a> . However, in recent years, scientists have begun to examine its effectiveness in the treatment of conditions like depression. Patients may go to one of a few hundred clinics in the United States who prescribe ketamine as a treatment for depression. They often leave feeling much better, and there is anecdotal support that as a treatment ketamine may also help decrease <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ketamine-helping-the-severely-depressed/" target="_blank"> suicidal thoughts </a>.</p>
<p>Drugs like MDMA, or ecstasy, continue to undergo trials approved by the FDA to treat Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and depressive conditions. <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881112456611" target="_blank"> These small studies have had promising results too </a> . Some have indicated that after a few rounds of treatment, those living with PTSD reported a significant reduction in symptoms, with many going on to avoid mental health relapse in follow-up contact with the researchers.</p>
<h2>Microdosing and Marijuana</h2>
<p>There has been an increasing amount of research about the <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/medical-marijuana-2018011513085" target="_blank"> health benefits of marijuana </a> . It helps treats symptoms associated with many health conditions such as HIV/AIDS, PTSD, various cancers, and anxiety amongst others.</p>
<p>Microdosing has emerged as a potential treatment tool to help those with such conditions gain the healing and medical benefits of marijuana but minimize the experience of being “high,” as well as other <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/treating-anxiety-with-marijuana-effects/" target="_blank">potential negative consequences</a> such as altered states of consciousness, low motivation, overeating, and hallucinations. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/is-cbd-oil-good-for-mental-health/" target="_blank">CBD oil</a> is most mainstream arm of marijuana-related treatment and has been approved in some states for the treatment of certain conditions, even for children for conditions like seizures.</p>
<p>Attitudes towards using street substances for medicinal purposes are slowly changing. By extension, this shift sets the stage for ongoing research about microdosing, which has largely been non-mainstream to date.</p>
<h2>The Future of Microdosing</h2>
<p>While very few treatment providers provide microdosing services, there is certainly momentum building in the medical community about its benefits due to ongoing anecdotal and research support for the use of drugs like LSD, ketamine, and marijuana (or CBD oil) for a variety of health conditions. However, we still have a lot to learn and there has yet to be a mountain of evidence around the long term effects of microdosing with these substances.</p>
<p>There is still a lot of research that needs to be done in order for the medical community to have great faith in the positive outcomes and utility of microdosing. That being said, anecdotal experiences have indicated that microdosing may soon be a viable option for people looking to treat a range of psychological and physical health problems. As with any treatment option, be sure to speak with a licensed physician if you’re considering microdosing as an option.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people who have mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression turn to cannabis as a source of relief from their psychiatric illnesses. Cannabis comes in many forms or strains, and because of the ease of access, people have traditionally smoked marijuana containing the controversial psychoactive tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). This chemical gets you “high,” which helps some find relief from anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>But for those with mental health issues, smoking marijuana and eating THC marijuana edibles are not always the best way to find relief from symptoms. At times, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/treating-anxiety-with-marijuana-effects/" target="_blank">smoking or taking an edible may even exacerbate symptoms</a>. That’s one of the reasons CBD oil, which doesn’t contain unwanted psychoactive substances, is gaining recognition.</p>
<p><span id="more-9902"></span></p>
<h2>What is CBD Oil?</h2>
<p>CBD hemp oil is made from high-CBD, low-THC hemp, unlike medical marijuana products, which are usually made from plants with high concentrations of THC. Because hemp contains only trace amounts of THC, these hemp oil products are non-psychoactive. This means they do not change the state of mind of the person who uses them. However, CBD oil does appear to produce significant changes in the body and has been found to have medical benefits.</p>
<p>Since cannabis use, and specifically the use of CBD, hasn’t been studied extensively, here are answers to common questions.</p>
<h2>What Forms Does It Come In?</h2>
<p>Most people access CBD in its oil format. Much like its THC-laden counterpart, some CBD oil can be smoked or vaporized. For patients who might not want to inhale, however, it’s more commonly found in a variety of other forms including oral droppers, sprays, topical treatments, and massage oils.</p>
<h2>How Does CBD Oil Work?</h2>
<p>All cannabinoids, including CBD, attach themselves to receptors in the body to produce their effects. The human body <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317221.php" target="_blank">produces certain cannabinoids on its own</a> and has two receptors for cannabinoids — CB1 and CB2 receptors.</p>
<p>CB1 receptors are found all around the body, but many are in the brain. The receptors in the brain deal with: coordination, movement, pain, emotions and mood, thinking, appetite, and memories, among others. THC also attaches to these receptors.</p>
<p>CB2 receptors are more common in the immune system. They affect inflammation and pain. It used to be thought that CBD acts on these CB2 receptors, but it’s now thought that CBD does not act on either receptor directly. Instead, it seems to influence the body to use more of its own cannabinoids.</p>
<h2>Is CBD Oil Legal?</h2>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/legal-marijuana-states-2018-1" target="_blank">29 states</a> where medical marijuana is legal, CBD products are covered by those same legal protections. Additionally, <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/health/qualifying-conditions-for-medical-marijuana-by-state" target="_blank">16 states</a> have passed CBD-only laws, which legalize the possession and use of CBD products for specific qualifying conditions — but not cannabis products containing higher levels of THC. Those CBD-only laws often limit the legal possession and use of CBD products to children with epilepsy, and some nerve and muscle afflictions.</p>
<h2>Will CBD Oil Improve My Mental Health?</h2>
<p>“Right now, there’s not enough conclusive effort to say either way,” said Rachel O’Neill, a licensed professional clinical counselor for <a href="http://talkspace.com/online-therapy" target="_blank">Talkspace</a> based on Youngstown, Ohio. “The short answer is: it might be. Some researchers have suggested that CBD can help decrease symptoms of psychosis, like seeing things that aren’t there and hearing voices. Researchers have also identified the potential of CBD oil to decrease symptoms of anxiety and to potentially assist in the treatment of substance use disorders.”</p>
<p>Although the use of CBD oil holds potential promise for those with mental health issues, additional research is needed to determine appropriate doses for effective treatment.</p>
<h2>How Do I Know How Much to Use?</h2>
<p>“This one is tricky,” O’Neill said. “CBD oil is not FDA-approved, which means there are no federal regulations that govern the production of the substance. As such there are no universally accepted guidelines on what is an appropriate dosage or what form of delivery (e.g. topical, oral) is most appropriate.”</p>
<p>“Lastly, and perhaps most concerning,” O’Neill continued, “there are no standardized formulations for CBD oil, which means that there is no guarantee that what you’re purchasing is actually CBD oil. Those interested in beginning CBD oil treatment should consider speaking with a medical specialist or other trusted source to determine appropriate dosing.”</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts and Advice</h2>
<p>If you’re thinking of using CBD oil to help treat your mental health issues, O’Neill has the following advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s always a good rule of thumb to consult your medical provider before beginning any medical treatment, including over-the-counter supplements.</li>
<li>Be aware that because CBD is not federally regulated, it’s possible that the dosage that you’ve been promised isn’t accurate.</li>
<li>Be aware of legality in your state specific to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although there is potential promise for those with mental health issues in the use of CBD oil, there are risks. Above all, we need more research to determine the best dosage for effective treatment.</p>

<p>You may have read or been told five times just this year that you’re the combination of the five people you spend the most time around. Motivational Speaker Jim Rohn famously stated this, and the concept has since been popularized throughout the self-help world.</p>
<p>Science and psychology have both supported and refuted the idea, but let’s play with another part of it for just a minute. Regardless of whether you<em> become like</em> the five people you choose to spend the most time, with one thing is clear: you are making a choice to spend your time with them.</p>
<p><span id="more-9760"></span></p>
<p>Life is about choices. You can choose to get up on time or hit snooze each morning, you can choose to take a long or short shower, and you choose to give your work 100% or 60% of your effort on a given project or day. You also choose to have a drink with someone new or your best friend of 10 years. You can choose to go to the restaurant you know you and your partner both love or choose to try a new one down the street with mixed reviews.</p>
<p>What’s another thing that, at its core, is centered on choices? Self-care.</p>
<p>What if we got wild for a moment and thought about who and how we choose to spend our time with as a complete act of self-care?</p>
<p>Whether these people will “rub off” on you or not, you are still choosing to expel your energy on these fellow humans. That says something in itself.</p>
<p>Let’s break down that choice a bit more to let it sink in.</p>
<p>We each have 24 hours in a day and 168 hours in a week. Take out 58 for sleeping and your balance is at 110. Take out another 40 work for and you’re at 70. 70 hours a week, or 10 hours a day to do everything from taking that long or short shower, to eating a meal, sipping coffee, drinking a glass of wine, reading, writing, playng with your children, watching Netflix, hitting up a new brunch spot, creating and messaging potential connections on <a class="recomendedHyperlink" href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/best-dating-websites" target="_blank">dating sites</a>, heading to the airport and hopping a flight.</p>
<p>But what about those less than exciting or relaxing activities we have to do, like rushing to get ready, commuting, running around a grocery store without a shopping list, and transporting children to and from activities? If we carve out (a generously low number of) 15 hour a week on tasks we have to—but don’t love to—do, we’re left with 55 hours in the week for the rest.</p>
<p>How do you spend that time? Or, back to the crux of this idea, <em>who</em> do you spend that time with?</p>
<p>Regardless of whether we <em>become</em> <em>like</em> those 5, are we even aware that we’re choosing to spend so much of our 55 hours with these people so frequently?</p>
<p>We should be.</p>
<p>Who we expell our energy and time on is one of the biggest declarations we can make <em>to ourselves</em> of what matters to us. Think back to who you were spending much of your freetime with five years ago, or 10 years ago. What does that show you? What mattered to you then? What about now? How—and with whom—do you want to be spending your free time?</p>
<p>When we start viewing the selection of who we spend our time with <em>as</em> a form of self-care, something powerful happens. We become more deliberate with our choices and our time. Think about how you wish to be spending <em>your</em> free time, and then assess who makes the cut to join you! Whether you both rub off on each other or not, this is an act of self-care.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve never understood the people who are able to set one alarm for the morning and actually wake up at that designated time. I didn’t count, but I think I set 15 alarms this morning all in 5 to 10 minute increments. Once I finally got out of bed, I threw on clothes, didn’t eat breakfast and ran out the door — only to be angry at myself, and <i>still </i>not feel well rested. On the way to where I needed to be, I asked myself, “WHY AM I LIKE THIS!?”</p>
<p>I set out to figure out if I’m alone in this mayhem by asking some of my friends about their morning routines (or, lack thereof).</p>
<p><span id="more-9663"></span></p>
<h2>How My Friends Wake Up</h2>
<p><i>“Alarm set for 6:15, 6:30, 6:45, and 7 as an ‘Oh s***!’ alarm. I snooze them all a million times. I don’t get out of bed until 7:15. I take a quick shower. Let my dogs out and feed them. Half-ass my makeup and appearance. Rush out, don’t eat.” &#8211; Diana, 29</i></p>
<p><i>“I sleep ‘til the last second. Snooze two times. Check my phone, pee, wash my face, turn my sound machine off, brush my teeth, do my makeup, then rush to find something to wear and I don’t eat.” &#8211; Amanda, 28</i></p>
<p><i>“I snooze as late as I can until I hate myself for being so late, make coffee, take Pancho out, wash my face, do my makeup, make my bed, maybe answer work emails if I’m still drinking coffee and have time, put on overalls, and leave. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/how-to-eat-your-way-to-mental-health/" target="_blank">Breakfast optional</a>.” &#8211; Caroline, 24 (who really does wear overalls most days)</i></p>
<p><i>“I wake up at 5, grab my work clothes, lunch, and gym bag, go to the gym, shower at my parents’ house halfway between gym and work, hang out with my dog, then go to work” &#8211; Pete, 33</i></p>
<h2>Which Routine Is Healthiest?</h2>
<p>Now, as daunting as waking up at 5 AM sounds, doesn’t it seem like Pete has the healthiest, most productive morning?</p>
<p>When you think about it, the way our morning begins sort of sets the mood for the whole day. So, by having a positive, relaxed morning regimen, you can set yourself up for having a good day. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/secret-stressors-killing-you/" target="_blank">We can’t control external forces</a> — the traffic we might face on the way to work, the rude people we might encounter on the subway, and so on — but we <i>can </i>control what we do before we leave home in the morning, and that may make a big difference.</p>
<p>Your morning routine, as with any other aspect of how you live your life, can certainly be an indicator of your current mental health, as well as the way you approach self care in general. As much as I want to think aggressively tapping the snooze button on my phone is self care, it’s not.</p>
<h2>Why Routine is Important</h2>
<p>The same routine isn’t going to work for everyone, but what <i>can </i>be agreed upon is that, scientifically, <a href="https://www.headspace.com/blog/2016/08/22/the-secret-benefit-of-routines-it-wont-surprise-you/" target="_blank">routines are great for our mental health</a>. They’re especially great to help out people with depression and anxiety (so, um, maybe I should take a hint and do better in the morning). While building and maintaining a routine sounds boring or stressful, in the long run, <a href="https://blogs.psychcentral.com/imperfect/2017/01/routine-that-supports-good-mental-health/" target="_blank">routine will reduce stress and anxiety</a>. Routines are also very beneficial for <a href="http://mentalhealthcenter.org/boring-self-care-importance-routines/" target="_blank">recovering addicts</a>.</p>
<p>A hormone called <a href="http://inpathybulletin.com/importance-morning-routines-routines-boost-mental-health/" target="_blank">cortisol in our body is working in our favor in the morning</a>. Levels of this hormone are highest when you first wake up, which will give you a little lift in energy. Use the hormone to your advantage!</p>
<p>If you like yoga, go for <a href="https://www.yogajournal.com/videos/salute-the-sun" target="_blank">a round of sun salutations</a> to wake up your muscles. If you’re extra stressed out, try meditating (you can do so with the help of an app, I won’t judge). And here’s a revolutionary idea—instead of refreshing Instagram 20 times before breakfast, why not read a newspaper article or do a crossword puzzle? Warm up your brain!</p>
<p>If that’s not enough inspiration for you, you can research <a href="https://www.success.com/article/10-morning-routines-of-wildly-successful-entrepreneurs" target="_blank">morning routines of extremely successful people</a>. But, you know, take baby steps!</p>
<h2>A Routine Challenge</h2>
<p>So, if you made it this far, I challenge you to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/11/dont-forget-to-thank-the-most-important-person-in-your-life-you/" target="_blank">make at least one little change</a> to your morning routine this week and see if it makes you feel any different. I’m going to do the same, and I think we’ll both be glad we did so.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Physical fitness gets a lot of attention, and for good reason — good physical health can prevent conditions such as heart disease or diabetes, and help you maintain a long, independent life. But often neglected is mental fitness — having a healthy and strong mind to allow you to handle the challenges and opportunities that life puts in front of you.</p>
<p>A common thought is that the absence of a mental health disorder means that a person is mentally fit and emotionally well, but according to <a href="https://www.waldenu.edu/about/colleges-schools/college-of-social-and-behavioral-sciences/school-of-counseling/faculty/bios/rachel-oneill" target="_blank">Rachel O’Neill</a>, a licensed professional clinical counselor, that’s a dangerous misconception. “An individual can certainly experience periods of stress, discomfort, sadness, or anxiety without necessarily meeting criteria for a mental health disorder,” she said. “Mental wellness is a process, and just like physical health, it’s an ongoing process to maintain mental and emotional wellness.”</p>
<p><span id="more-9623"></span></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, trying or stressful times can be the ultimate test of mental fitness. When we are winded by a major life event, being able to recover quickly requires significant mental strength and psychological resilience. The benefits of being mentally fit means we are able to use our mental abilities to our fullest extent, allowing us to be more creative, make the most of opportunities as they present themselves, and approach stressful situations more calmly and with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/when-does-normal-anxiety-become-a-mental-illness/" target="_blank">less anxiety</a>.</p>
<p>So, what can you do to increase your mental fitness levels?</p>
<h2>1. Focus on One Thing at a Time</h2>
<p>Multitasking is worn as a badge of honor, but multitasking too much is not healthy. Practice being present. When you are taking a walk, take in your surroundings — the weather, the birds. When you are spending time with friends, really listen to what is being said. Turn off your phone and try to forget the running to-do lists in your head.</p>
<h2>2. Exercise</h2>
<p>“<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/5-ways-exercise-is-great-for-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">Physical and mental health go hand-in-hand</a> and should not be considered separate, as poor mental health can lead to poor physical health and vice versa,” said Kimberly Leitch, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talkspace" target="_blank">Talkspace </a>therapist based in New York City.</p>
<p>Like medicine in the treatment of mental illness, exercise can increase levels of serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. <a href="https://www.nami.org/Blogs/NAMI-Blog/May-2016/Exercise-for-Mental-Health-8-Keys-to-Get-and-Stay" target="_blank">It improves and normalizes neurotransmitter levels</a>, which ultimately helps us feel mentally healthy. Other important benefits include: enhanced mood and energy, reduced stress, deeper relaxation, improved mental clarity, learning, insight, memory and cognitive functioning, enhanced intuition, creativity, assertiveness and enthusiasm for life, and improved social health and relationships, higher self-esteem and increased spiritual connection.</p>
<h2>3. Incorporate a Daily “Mindfulness Break”</h2>
<p>“Set aside one to two minutes each day to decompress, check in with your body, and assess how you’re feeling,” O’Neill said. “There are a number of great apps that can help you incorporate a structured mindfulness practice or you can simply develop a practice that works for you.”</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.simplehabit.com/2017/03/06/the-scientific-benefits-of-mindfulness-and-meditation/" target="_blank">Just one week of brief daily mindfulness</a> meditation practice has been found to produce significant improvements in attention, energy and stress. Research shows these benefits are more than just subjective: participants of <a href="https://blog.simplehabit.com/2017/03/06/the-scientific-benefits-of-mindfulness-and-meditation/" target="_blank">a study</a> experienced actual decreases in stress-controlled cortisol and improvement in their immune system. They also displayed improved visuospatial processing, working memory, and executive functioning — important sets of mental skills that help you get things done faster.</p>
<h2>4. Set Aside “Self-care” Time</h2>
<p>Give yourself an afternoon or evening to engage in something that you genuinely enjoy doing. It can be exercising, reading, binge watching your favorite show — essentially, make a date with yourself to do something fun that’s just for you.</p>
<h2>5. Set Limits and Stick With Them</h2>
<p>Living in a success-driven society has its advantages. But <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/working-hard-burning-out/" target="_blank">it also has disadvantages, like burnout</a>, which is a real concern when you’re trying to have it all: a fulfilling career, an Instagram-worthy time with friends and a happy family life. Remember that it’s okay to say no sometimes. To the extent it is possible, set boundaries within your professional and personal life so that you’re not overextending yourself.</p>
<h2>6. Ask for Help</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/how-to-ask-for-help-mental-health-care/" target="_blank">Seeking help is often the first step towards getting and staying well</a>, but it can be hard to know how to start or where to turn to. It’s common to feel unsure, and to wonder whether you should try to handle things on your own.</p>
<p>“But to put it simply, there’s never a wrong time to seek help,” O’Neill said. “Talking with someone about your thoughts and feelings can always help you to gain insight that will likely be beneficial in your life. If you find yourself experiencing periods of stress, or feeling angry, irritable, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/02/comforting-man-hes-crying-know/">sad</a>, or easily frustrated, it could be a good invitation to seek out professional help to deal with those feelings.”</p>
<p>Mental fitness doesn’t have to take up a lot of your time. Spending a few minutes on it every day can help you feel better and think more clearly. Remember that relaxation is just as important in a mental workout as the more energetic activities, such as memory exercises or physical exercise.</p>
