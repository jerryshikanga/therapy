				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA), <a href="https://adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statistics" target="_blank">roughly 18% of adults in the U.S. suffer from an anxiety disorder</a>. As mental illness reaches epidemic proportions, innovative solutions and effective treatment options are required.</p>
<p>Mindfulness can be a powerful tool in dealing with various mental health challenges and symptoms. Beyond breathing exercises, mindfulness means being fully aware of the facets of the body and mind. This helps in assessing intrusive thoughts and emotional reactions.<br />
<span id="more-9468"></span></p>
<h2>Mindfulness Strategies by Diagnosis</h2>
<p>By working with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/09/different-types-therapy-psychotherapy-best/">a therapist who specializes in mindfulness-based therapy</a>, you may receive positive therapeutic benefits at a faster rate. Here are a few areas where mindfulness treatment can improve mental health.<br />
<br class=“”></p>
<h3>Stress and Anxiety</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3622911/" target="_blank">Studies have shown</a> that mindfulness therapy is an effective solution for stress management. The approach works through a focused relaxing of the body and mind during, and after, stressful events.</p>
<p>Mindfulness practices alleviate anxiety by focusing oneself on your present state, rather than worries about the future or other destructive ruminations.<br />
<br class=“”></p>
<h3>Chronic Pain</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.thegoodbody.com/chronic-pain-statistics/" target="_blank">More than a billion people around the world suffer from some form of chronic pain</a>. Physical pain and other terminal conditions can seriously affect mental well-being.</p>
<p>Mindfulness makes <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/what-is-invisible-illness-how-to-explain-it-to-others/" target="_blank">daily trials with chronic pain</a> more manageable. It allows the mind to observe the pain objectively and accept the sensation’s role in one’s life. Therapy that incorporates mindfulness can increase quality of life by providing an increased level of mental relief for chronic pain.<br />
<br class=“”></p>
<h3>Depression</h3>
<p>Mindfulness leads to better control over emotions, which can be beneficial for coping with depression.</p>
<p>The practice allows people to be present in the moment, rather than sinking into the black hole of negative thoughts, rejection, and self-criticism. This awareness ensures a more holistic response to any situation without being caught up in overwhelming or negative emotions.<br />
<br class=“”></p>
<h3>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</h3>
<p>OCD introduces a constant storm of intrusive thoughts and compulsions. This often leads to disruptive, ritualistic behaviors or the inability to leave the house due to irrational thought patterns around disastrous scenarios.</p>
<p>Mindfulness therapy can help those who live with OCD achieve peace through a clearer mind. A therapist can teach clients with OCD to respond with mindfulness techniques when their thoughts or compulsions impede one’s ability to feel in control of a situation.<br />
<br class=“”></p>
<h3>Substance Abuse and Addiction</h3>
<p>The desire to avoid pain and discomfort is sometimes a component of substance abuse and potential relapse. These actions arise from a need to continuously experience stimuli that provide a pleasurable feeling. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/addiction-mental-illness/" target="_blank">Substance abuse and addiction negatively affect mental health</a> by tying compulsions to detrimental desires.</p>
<p>Practicing mindfulness helps create awareness around the root of these desires, and the ability to feel negative emotions without judgment. Focusing on the available freedom to make the right choice in each moment helps reduce cravings that lead to destructive behaviors. Rather than avoiding issues behind addiction, mindfulness encourages inquiry into specific thoughts and feelings.</p>
<h2>Mindfulness as a Solution</h2>
<p>While mindfulness might seem unconventional, it’s an increasingly accepted method of achieving a healthier mind. Therapists who teach mindfulness techniques to their clients do so to help them cope with mental health challenges and strive for a sense of peace.</p>
<p>If the concept of mindfulness appeals to you, <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/">consider connecting with a professional therapist</a> who can aid you in its practice, providing a beneficial boost on your mental health journey.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Originally a tool for our ancestors&#8217; survival, anxiety is not as handy as it used to be, what with the shortage of predatory animals inhabiting the same space as us. As an anxiety sufferer of almost 17 years, I can hardly recall a time when I wasn&#8217;t nervous or scared of something. I developed it at the age of five. But when I was that young, I didn’t even understand what it was.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I took a psychology class in high school that I became fascinated with mental health. I realized I had anxiety, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a>, and a laundry list of other issues. But over the last year or so, I&#8217;ve spent a lot of my time researching and practicing ways to better cope with and even quell these illnesses.</p>
<p>Compared to all other means of getting my anxiety to chill out, meditation has been the most effective and beneficial to my overall well-being. When we see the word “meditation,” we sometimes picture a monk in lotus pose perched atop a rock on a mountain. While that would be considered meditating, that&#8217;s not the only way to go about it. Meditating, at its core, is an act of quieting the mind. It can be on a mountain or in your living room.<span id="more-5928"></span></p>
<h2>Classic Meditation</h2>
<p>The best part about what I call “classic meditation” is you don&#8217;t need anything apart from yourself to make it work. It&#8217;s only a matter of finding a quiet place, taking a seat, and closing your eyes.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve found a desirable location and your eyes are shut, try to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/03/how-you-can-beat-anxiety-with-mindful-breathing/" target="_blank">focus attention on your breath</a>. Taking deep breaths is key here. I like to count to three in between each inhale and exhale.</p>
<p>Try to focus on only one thing. You might notice this is much easier said than done, though. This is because our brains are used to zipping between thoughts without a moment&#8217;s notice. When you practice meditating, classic or otherwise, it teaches you how to relax thoughts and train attention on a single thing.</p>
<p>If sitting in silence isn&#8217;t your cup of tea, though, don&#8217;t fret. Allow me to introduce to you what I call “distracted meditation.”</p>
<h2>Distracted Meditation</h2>
<p>Distracted meditation sounds like an oxymoron, but allow me to explain. I call it “distracted” because you don&#8217;t have to be in a quiet place with your eyes closed.Meditation doesn&#8217;t have to be sitting in silence. In fact, nearly anything can be considered meditation under the right circumstances.</p>
<p>As an example, I&#8217;m going to refer to my favorite form of distracted meditation: music. Whether I&#8217;m listening to it, playing it, or recording it, music never fails to make me forget about the time going by. I&#8217;ll start writing a song, and before I know it, two hours have gone by. This is the key to distracted meditation.</p>
<p>Staying busy can help when it comes to having anxiety. On the other hand, distracted meditation involves total immersion in whatever you&#8217;re doing. It can be gaming, reading a book, taking a nature walk — anything. Your goal is to block out everything except the one task you&#8217;re working on.</p>
<h2>Making Your Choice</h2>
<p>If more people were aware of distracted meditation, they might be more inclined to give it a shot. Either way, most of us practice it whether we realize it or not. It&#8217;s not a means to ending your anxiety, but it can <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/how-to-get-rid-of-anxiety-separating-good-bad/" target="_blank">reduce it</a>. Having a clearer mind is far better than having one congested with fear and nervousness.</p>
<p>I discuss meditation, among other methods of dealing with anxiety in my free e-book, “<a href="https://sites.psu.edu/adamsportfolio/files/2017/04/Anxiety-Friends-20c6tjn.pdf" target="_blank">Anxiety &amp; Friends</a>.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mindfulness is the power of living in the moment, embracing your current circumstances without judgement or pretense. To be mindful is to be a conscious observer.</p>
<p>Mindfulness is a big trend, not only in popular culture, but in contemporary therapy. Many counselors tout this westernized version of traditional Eastern practices as a way to promote relaxation and reduce stress in clients. It’s become a popular training topic for clinicians because there is <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735813000731" target="_blank">evidence</a> that it helps reduce <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxiety</a> and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a>.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a>, I often incorporate mindfulness-based cognitive strategies in my work to help clients deal with stressful jobs and lives. In my practice I’ve found it to be especially effective at battling anxiety and perfectionism. It can be a challenge, however, to incorporate mindfulness in your daily routine if you’re not used to slowing down and paying conscious attention.<span id="more-5528"></span></p>
<p>The key to embodying mindfulness is to actually turn into a keen observer. Using the five senses — sight, sound, smell, taste and touch — can help you take in the world around you. They can be of great help in slowing down and living in the moment.</p>
<p>Sometimes most of what we observe in the world around us exists only as background noise. By slowing down to describe our environment, we allow ourselves to fully appreciate the world around us. When we draw our attention to our role as observers, somehow other concerns and worries tend to fade into the background.</p>
<h2>Examples of How You Can Use Mindfulness and the 5 Senses in Your Daily Life</h2>
<p>In Japan there is a concept called “shinrin-yoku,” which means “forest bathing.” This process includes spending time in nature on light walks of wander. This departure from the hustle and bustle of everyday life promotes relaxation. The practice involves walking in nature and using the five senses as tools to connect to our natural surroundings.</p>
<p>In a forest walk you may take time to notice the sounds of leaves or fallen branches crunching underneath your shoes or the gentle warmth peeking through the canopy of trees. Exotic locations might also include soothing sounds like cascading waterfalls and the sweet songs of little birds. But one <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494413000959" target="_blank">does not have to live in an exotic location to practice mindfulness</a> in this way.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s difficult to explain the process of mindfulness. One way I find most helpful is to show my clients a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV-BAkuTmRU" target="_blank">video on tea meditation</a>. From the style of the video to the sounds, I believe it encourages a present-minded reflection and focus we often don’t incorporate during most of our waking hours.</p>
<p>I often share an example of a tea meditation practice because it’s something that’s accessible for a lot of people. The process includes a thoughtful and methodical process of fixing a cup of tea, setting up a quiet space to enjoy it and focusing on the experience.</p>
<p>When I practice this meditation, I use my senses to pay attention to everything from the smell of the tea, the warmth of the cup to the temperature in the room and the chair I’m sitting in. The entire process may take about 10-15 minutes. It can help set the tone at the start of a day or provide a much-needed end of the day respite.</p>
<p>Embracing mindful living has positive effects on anxiety and depression and fits into almost any daily routine. It is a philosophy that can be applied to any activity like drinking tea, meditating, or even washing dishes. By drawing our focus and attention to as many of our five senses as we can, we tap into a part of ourselves that is often disconnected from the world around us. It is in that moment we can truly feel at peace.</p>

<p>You hear that it&#8217;s good for you on the news, on the radio, and from every health enthusiast you speak to, but do you understand how meditation works &#8211; like scientifically? If not, you&#8217;re in luck, because the guys at <a title="The Scientific Power of Meditation - Decoded " href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC552Sd-3nyi_tk2BudLUzA" target="_blank">ASAPscience</a> &#8211; you know, the ones we told you about <a title="The Science of Depression " href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/the-science-of-depression-decoded/" target="_blank">last Friday</a>? &#8211; have done it again! In a concise, engaging, and thoroughly entertaining manner, Mitchell Moffit and Gregory Brown take you through the science of mediation in exactly 3 very informative minutes. And you should totally watch it! <span id="more-1635"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aw71zanwMnY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By providing excellent insight into how engaging in meditation practice benefits the mind and body, the video makes a powerful argument for why we should give it a shot. As they explain, practicing meditation directly impacts the health of your brain as well as your heart, and pretty much every vital organ in your body. So, there&#8217;s really no good reason we can&#8217;t dedicate at least 20 minutes per day to improving our overall physical and mental health by doing nothing.</p>
<h3>Giving clear examples and stimulating visuals, the duo at ASAPscince do an excellent job at explaining all of the buzz surrounding meditation.</h3>

<p><em>&#8211; by Ben Epstein, Ph.D / Talkspace Therapist</em></p>
<p>No longer confined to yoga classrooms and meditation retreats, mindfulness has entered the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; &#8211; from the boardrooms of Fortune 500 companies to the chambers of the United States Congress. Recent developments in mindfulness research, published in <a title="Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy compared with maintenance antidepressant treatment in the prevention of depressive relapse or recurrence (PREVENT): a randomised controlled trial" href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2814%2962222-4/abstract" target="_blank">The Lancet</a> journal, indicate that Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) offers a similar level of protection against depressive relapses as antidepressants.</p>
<p><span id="more-349"></span></p>
<h4>What exactly is mindfulness and how can it be practiced?</h4>
<p>Jon Kabat-Zinn, a mindfulness-practice teacher and developer of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) technique, defines mindfulness as an &#8220;awareness that arises through paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment and non-judgmentally.” Seems pretty simple &#8211; we all know how to pay attention, right? And yet, anyone who has attempted to bring greater mindful presence into their day-to-day quickly found out that the mind often has a mind of its own! Don&#8217;t fret. At first, pretty much everyone has a hard time maintaining and sustaining attention. While it certainly does help having access to a formal meditation practice, it’s not critical for living a more mindful life.</p>
<p>When people come to me, looking to learn how to be more present in their lives and relationships, as a Talkspace therapist I strive to provide them with concrete suggestions on how to do that.</p>
<p>Part of Talkspace’s appeal is the convenience with which we, the therapists, can help and support our clients without throwing them off of their daily routine. This, however, poses a unique challenge – we have to provide them with concrete exercises that they can do independently of us, when we cannot connect with them. It’s also important for us to make sure these exercises are easy enough to stick into the client’s daily schedule. So, we often recommend they start practicing mindfulness.</p>
<p>Below you’ll find five suggestions for fitting mindfulness practice into your lives – although, if you can take a formal class, you should totally do so.</p>
<h4>1<b>. The best part of waking up.</b></h4>
<p>I am not myself until I have my morning cup of coffee. However, I spent a large portion of my life thoughtlessly gulping it down while trying to satisfy my craving for it. Mindfulness changed this for me. Buddhist spiritual leader, <a title="Thich Nhat Hanh" href="http://plumvillage.org/book/how-to-eat/" target="_blank">Thich Nhat Hanh</a>, literally made the act of preparing a cup of tea into an art form. He simply showed how each step can be taken with care and attention. To clarify, nothing fancy or sexy actually happened, but something very real did.</p>
<p>By practicing mindfulness over your regular morning coffee, you can be creating an intentional pause in what otherwise could be an incredibly hectic day. Take the time to really examine and play with the cup, smell and taste the coffee (yes, you can focus on the smell for quite some time), pay attention to the sound of you drinking it, and linger on the aftertaste. All of these moments can help create a mindful sanctuary in your morning routine, free of disturbances and worries.</p>
<h4><b style="line-height: 1.6471;">2. Email and exhale.</b></h4>
<p>When it comes to technology, it often feels like we have very little control over the amount of time we spend checking our emails, updating our social media pages, or responding to pressing texts. Many of my Talkspace clients have stressful work demands and are looking for ways to lighten their load. One of my suggestions is to make sure they are seated when engaging in some sort of technological communication.</p>
<p>I assure you &#8211; this practice helps focus your attention. You can&#8217;t help being more in the moment if you know you have to sit down to reply to a text or email. For example, a client of mine once told me that he sat down in the middle of an elevator to respond to an urgent text. While this may have gotten him some sideways glances, ultimately he was able to focus on the task at hand. This can be said to be the ultimate goal of the mindfulness practice and living a more fulfilling life.</p>
<h4><b style="line-height: 1.6471;">3. Let it Ring.</b></h4>
<p>True &#8211; technology has been blamed for the distractibility and mindlessness of our societies. At Talkspace, however, we believe that when used properly, technology can actually foster mindfulness. When we instinctively lunge to answer the phone as soon as it goes off, that&#8217;s probably the epitome of mindlessness. It’s an automatic reaction; we don’t think about it – we just do it without any intention or focus.</p>
<p>Let it ring. Once. Twice. Three times. And with each ring, take a breath. This will serve as a built in reminder to be in the moment. One of my Talkspace clients told me that by incorporating this tactic into her life, she noticed a change not only in her demeanor, but in the people she was having the conversations with as well! &#8220;[It’s] almost as if my feelings of calm are passing through the phone lines.”</p>
<h4><b>3. Shake it off.</b></h4>
<p>You don&#8217;t need a prestigious publication to tell you that sitting for extended periods of time isn&#8217;t great for your health, but according to the <a title="Television Viewing and Time Spent Sedentary in Relation to Cancer Risk: A Meta-Analysis" href="http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/106/7/dju098.full" target="_blank"><i>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</i></a><i>,</i> this behavior can actually be fatal.</p>
<p>I encourage my clients to get out of their seats and stretch. By tuning into the physical sensations of lifting up your arms or bending down to touch your toes, you will be able to move your body without disappearing from your desk. There are some great basic Hatha yoga poses, like hands to heart or Tadasana, that can restore the balance in your mind and body in the middle of a hectic workday. Remember it&#8217;s about paying attention, so choose one area of your body and maintain your focus on it in a methodical way. As one client told me, &#8220;I feel invigorated even when I am entering mind numbing data.&#8221;</p>
<h4><b style="line-height: 1.6471;">5. One day at a time.</b></h4>
<p>One of my favorite comedians, <a title="Hannibal Buress" href="http://hannibalburess.com/" target="_blank">Hannibal Buress</a>, made a hilarious (you had to be there) and very astute observation in one of his stand-up routines. He remarked, &#8220;when people go through something rough in life, they say, &#8216;I&#8217;m taking it one day at a time.&#8217; Yes, so is everybody, because that&#8217;s how time works.&#8221; He is absolutely correct. We are often trying to make things happen faster than they would at their natural pace. This futile endeavor often leaves us feeling frustrated and burnt out, which is even more worrisome from a psychological perspective.</p>
<p>So, what can we do to curtail this self-sabotaging process?</p>
<p>In his seminal work, <a title="Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind" href="http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Mind-Beginners-Shunryu-Suzuki/dp/1590308492" target="_blank"><i>Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind</i></a>, Shunryu Suzuki writes, “In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s there are few”.</p>
<p>I encourage my clients to cultivate and practice a beginner&#8217;s mindset. It means being open to every experience during each moment, as if encountering it for the first time. It is a mindset that supports and encourages you to take one step at a time, which in truth is all we can really be doing anyway. (Go ahead. Try taking two steps at the same time. Get my point?)</p>
<h3>By learning to cultivate a beginner’s mindset, you are practicing mindfulness and bringing value to each experience, giving you the power to carefully respond to life’s many curveballs.</h3>
