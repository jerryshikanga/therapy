				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The emotional stoicism of Black men is something that few authors have talked about. Most notable of the few books on the topic, the author bell hooks’ work <a href="https://www.amazon.com/We-Real-Cool-Black-Masculinity/dp/0415969271" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>We Real Cool: Black Men and Masculinity</i></a> discusses the lack of love and acceptance that Black men face, creating an emotional crisis.</p>
<p>Many men have not been told how to process and talk about their emotional experiences, furthering a sense of isolation, anger, and resentment. For these men, this creates an emotional volatility that can sometimes manifest in seeming “shut down” in relationships and friendships. At its worst, this budding resentment can manifest in outward expression of anger, aggression, and even violence. This is discussed further in Charlie Donaldson’s and Randy Flood’s book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mascupathy-Understanding-Healing-Malaise-American-ebook/dp/B00KHHJA4I" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Mascupathy: Understanding and Healing the Malaise of American Manhood</i></a>.</p>
<p>Many men (arguably most) struggle with the idea of being openly vulnerable and sharing their emotions. And for those who grew up as sensitive boys, they are often subject to ridicule and shaming for what are natural and healthy expressions of emotion. Black men face a unique challenge in that most of what is most prized about them may be their looks or bodies, but rarely ever their intellect and emotional intelligence. These things are often deemed too soft for any Black man to experience, delivering the message that if you are those things then you must change&#8230;and fast.</p>
<p><span id="more-10072"></span></p>
<p>That’s not to say that the tide isn’t shifting for Black men. Back in 2016 musician <a href="https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/kid-cudis-facebook-revelation-exposes-the-stigma-black-men-with-depression-experience-dg/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kid Cudi openly talked about his depression</a> on his social media account. Following this revelation, the internet made it a point to talk about Black men’s mental health with the hashtag <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yougoodman-black-men-and-mental-health_us_5951de6ae4b0c85b96c65c3d" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">#YouGoodMan</a>. This movement was designed to help encourage Black men to talk more about mental health issues together and serve as one another’s keepers. It was a moving moment in pop culture history to witness.</p>
<p>Kanye West has been more open in recent years about his mental health issues. Mogul Jay Z openly talked about infidelity and attending <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/">therapy</a> around the release of his album 4:44. Artists like Logic and Prodigy have also previously highlighted conversations on mental health in their work and public imagery. We are seeing a shift take place, but for many it’s not fast enough.</p>
<h2>The Barriers To Seeking Help</h2>
<p>Unrealistic expectations based on gender and race often keep many Black men (and other men of color) out of therapy. The stereotype is that men don’t even like to ask for directions! You can imagine how hard it is to say to another person out loud, “I think I need some help.”</p>
<p>It is a circular problem we experience. In order for Black men to get help, they must open up enough to let someone know that they need help. But in order to open up and ask for help, they have to crack the cool facade that bell hooks talks about in her works. As a Black man myself, I’ve felt that tension (and sometimes still do). I’ve also seen my clients struggle through letting themselves be in a vulnerable position, even while sitting across from someone who looks just like them. In most instances, Black men have not grown up believing that their internal emotional lives have inherent and productive value. This needs to change.</p>
<p>There is also a great distrust of medical providers by Black communities, especially amongst African American men. Historically, Black bodies have been used and abused by science in order to make scientific discoveries — think of the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, wherein African American men were left untreated to study the progression of the disease.</p>
<p>Black women have been subjected to this kind of treatment too. It is historical experiences like these that have created a deep cultural chasm that Black men must be aware of, and overcome, to allow someone into their hearts and minds. And let’s face it, that scene in <i>Get Out</i> didn’t help either! However, the fear of being sent into “the sunken place” by a racist psychologist in a thriller isn’t the nexus of that distrust and fear, it’s a representation of it.</p>
<p>Stigma and racism are big factors in the decision for Black men to seek support for <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/men-dont-deal-mental-health/">mental health issues</a>. Some research has even indicated that economic status often makes up a significant part of Black men’s mental health concerns, indicating a need for providers to not only unpack racialized experiences but also offer support on financial issues as well.</p>
<h2>A Path Forward for Men’s Mental Health Month</h2>
<p>As we enter Men’s Mental Health Month, it’s important for us to take a step back and honor the mental and emotional health of ourselves as men, and invest in spaces that help us unpack the influence of toxic masculinity that permeates through our society today.</p>
<p>It doesn’t make a man weak to acknowledge the fears he has about providing for his family, or the anxieties he has about existing in a world in which Black bodies are devalued&#8230;it’s simply realistic. We can work through these fears and worries by talking with other men, whether they are friends, fathers, siblings, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/">therapists</a>, or soon to be new friends in group therapy or other supportive spaces. These are spaces where we can heal. They just require a bit of risk to take advantage of them. On the other side of that risk is less anxiety, less depression, and less stress overall.</p>
<p>It’s well worth the risk.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Studies show it, anecdotes illustrate it, and entire movements are built around it: When it comes to professional and even personal success, historically marginalized people — women, racial minorities, sexual minorities, people with disabilities, and others — are judged negatively for their strengths.</p>
<p>Whether it’s women <a href="https://www.salon.com/2018/03/26/are-smart-women-scary-study-suggests-women-are-punished-for-academic-success-with-lower-pay/" target="_blank">being punished</a> for academic success or people of color <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/9/18/16307782/study-racism-jobs" target="_blank">being judged less competent</a> than their less-qualified white peers, discrimination continues to hamper us, from the classroom to the boardroom.</p>
<p><span id="more-9516"></span></p>
<p>With so many people around us <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/10/06/inclusion-diversity-employers-race/" target="_blank">questioning our worth</a>, it can be hard for women and historically marginalized people to maintain confidence in ourselves, even though we work our butts off and <i>know </i>we’re just as capable as the “good ol’ boys.” This, in turn, can lead to imposter syndrome: The persistent feeling that we don’t really deserve our success or that we’re just “faking it.”</p>
<h2>What is Imposter Syndrome?</h2>
<p>Imposter syndrome <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_ladder/2016/04/is_impostor_syndrome_real_and_does_it_affect_women_more_than_men.html" target="_blank">isn’t an actual psychological diagnosis</a>, it’s more a pattern of thinking. And it’s not just women and marginalized people who feel like frauds: People from every demographic suffer from imposter syndrome.</p>
<p>But for women and historically marginalized people, imposter syndrome can be <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/11/05/imposter_effect_women_feel_like_frauds_at_work_because_they_are_high_achieving.html" target="_blank">particularly lethal</a>, amplifying discriminatory messages we continue to receive in the workplace: subtle, daily reminders that others consider us “less-than” or that our accomplishments aren’t really ours.</p>
<p>Having others doubt our abilities to the point that we doubt ourselves can really do a number on our mental health, lowering self-confidence and hampering professional success. It’s truly unfair that marginalized people in particular have to deal with a history of discrimination that isn’t our fault. While it’s not our responsibility to change the world, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/02/self-awareness-will-make-your-life-better-heres-how-to-get-it/" target="_blank">we <i>can</i> change how we value ourselves</a>. And by kicking our own imposter syndrome to the curb, we can level the playing field for others.</p>
<p>Fighting imposter syndrome starts by recognizing that negative self-evaluations just aren’t true, and flipping that script to turn our perceived weaknesses into strengths. Next time you’re plagued with self-doubt, here are a few tips.</p>
<h2>It’s not you</h2>
<p>Let’s get one thing straight: Imposter syndrome isn’t just a personal problem. It’s an historic result of who gets to be in power and define success, based on categories like gender, race, sexuality, and ability.</p>
<p>People from groups who have historically dominated your field may doubt themselves, but they don’t have their abilities questioned in the same way women and minorities do. They can move more fluently through the workplace, academic, or political environments, because it was built primarily with them in mind. They don’t face the same kind of <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3031101/the-new-subtle-sexism-toward-women-in-the-workplace" target="_blank">daily discrimination</a> you might.</p>
<p>Next time you feel self-doubt wiggling in, remind yourself: The problem. Is. Not. You.</p>
<h2>Flip the script</h2>
<p>Whenever you feel that your gender, race, sexuality, ability, or other permanent characteristic make you less worthy of your position compared to the “big guys” — and yes, they normally <i>are</i> guys — remind yourself: You <i>deserve</i> to be here.</p>
<p>You are a person with inherent value and worth because you worked your butt off to achieve success <i>and </i>overcome obstacles on the way. Not only have you conquered the normal obstacles that everyone faces to get ahead in their education and field, you’ve also had to demonstrate the grit, determination, and competence to get ahead in a field where the barriers to entry may be high.</p>
<p>This is an asset, not a hindrance. It gives you insights and perspective people who come from more “conventional” backgrounds simply wouldn’t think of. Your difference isn’t your drawback: It’s your secret superpower.</p>
<h2>Team up</h2>
<p>One tricky problem women and racially marginalized people often face in the workplace is that we can be <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/10/being-black-work/409990/" target="_blank">punished or censored </a>for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2015/dec/03/why-the-angry-black-woman-cliche-has-no-place-at-work" target="_blank">speaking up and claiming space</a>, while men and people from a majority group may be rewarded. This can create a ton of anxiety, as we navigate the tricky balance between asserting ourselves but not wanting to appear “too” assertive. While it’s frustrating and definitely unfair, remind yourself (again and again and again) that you know what you’re talking about, and can find allies in your workplace who will back you up.</p>
<p>Get in touch with a prospective mentor who may have had a similar experience to yours. Team up with a workplace peer, or offer to help out someone just starting out. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/how-to-know-if-a-company-will-be-a-good-place-for-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">Finding allies for mutual support</a> will not only encourage your confidence, it will boost each of you up, giving others around you models of success. Plan together so you can support each other’s ideas at key meetings, and give each other genuine compliments and loving criticism.</p>
<p>An ally in the struggle can help reflect a more realistic self-image back at you, when everyone else may be giving you a distorted one.</p>
<h2>Pass it on</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, the imposter syndrome we feel as women and marginalized people isn’t just an individual problem, it’s a reflection of what kind of environments we study and work in. When we think of our imposter syndrome as a collective problem and not an individual one, we can take the blame off ourselves. And while the tendency for women and minorities to be the <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/news-flash-women-are-sick-of-being-the-office-mom" target="_blank">go-to people</a> in the office for “<a href="https://business.vanderbilt.edu/news/2018/02/26/tokenism-in-the-workplace/" target="_blank">diversity</a>” is exhausting and unfair, lifting up other women and marginalized people in the workplace not only helps them — it helps us.</p>
<p>So go ahead: <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/5-ways-improve-body-image-confidence-mental-health/" target="_blank">Love yourself</a>. Remind yourself of the fight you’ve put up to get where you are. Compliment your own work. Remember that your differences are strengths. When you quash that voice inside you that says you’re not good enough, and let yourself shine, you give others permission to embrace yourselves for what you are. The real deal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Originally, I was asked to write this piece about a time I felt empowered as a woman. All day I sat with the prompt, but nothing came to me. How sad is that?</p>
<p>Over the next couple of days, I asked a few of my female friends if they could think of a time they felt empowered. They couldn’t think of a specific time, either. I felt sad for them. I felt sad for myself.</p>
<p>Of course, all these <em>other</em> thoughts came flooding into my mind — about all the times I felt like my power was threatened as a woman (e.g. most of the time). All the times I’ve been in <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/sexual-harassment-is-about-mental-health-not-only-the-workplace/" target="_blank">situations that made me feel like a piece of meat</a> — something to look at and touch, but not a human to be communicated with, respected or honored.</p>
<p><span id="more-9273"></span></p>
<p>The first time it happened, I was a college freshman. An NYU guy asked me to come over and play GameCube. I love GameCube, so you better believe I went. A couple rounds of Super Smash Brothers in, he threw the controllers to the floor and started kissing me. Uncomfortably, I told him, “I thought you wanted to play video games and hang out&#8230;” He laughed and asked me, “Wow, you thought I actually wanted to play video games?”</p>
<p>I kept kissing him simply because I didn’t know what else to do. I didn&#8217;t want him to think I was a &#8220;bitch.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t want him to spread rumors about me. He tried to do more, and literally begged me to touch him and do more. I said no. He assured me he’d return the favor, as if that’s the reason I was holding back. When I told him I wasn’t going to do that, the response I received from him was something I never saw coming.</p>
<p>“You’re giving me blue balls. Leave.” Because we were in a high-security Manhattan dorm, guests had to be checked in and out. So I couldn’t just leave — I had to be escorted by this guy down to the lobby. We stood in the elevator in silence, avoiding one another&#8217;s gaze. He signed me out, the security guard gave me back my ID, and I left. I walked 20 blocks back to my dorm, trying to process what had just happened. How’s that for a walk of shame?</p>
<p>Was it my fault for going to his dorm? Should I have stopped him as soon as he started kissing me? I did what I could at the time, deleting his number and blocking him on every social media platform. I never wanted to see his face again, but six years later, I still remember it vividly.</p>
<p>Even more vividly, I remember how I felt on that walk home, ashamed, angry at myself, and in a rage toward that guy. As you can probably guess, that situation was only the beginning of what I’ve faced in this past years and to this day — situations which are sadly the norm for me, my female friends, and women everywhere. We commiserate over wine with these stories and tell each other how unsurprising it all is, each and every time, as yet another new horror story materializes. So much for women&#8217;s empowerment.</p>
<p>Before that incident, I was naïve enough to think things like this only happened in teen dramas. My friends have been raped, almost beaten by their partners, had nude photos leaked, been sexually assaulted at work, and stealthed (that&#8217;s the term for when a guy takes his condom off during sex without consent — and yes there&#8217;s a term for it because it&#8217;s so common now).</p>
<p>Compared to them, I’m lucky. I wonder if any of my friends haven&#8217;t experienced anything like this. Are any of them asking for it? Absolutely not. No matter what they’re wearing, no matter if they kiss someone, no matter if they go to their apartment or dorm, no matter if they send a nude photo.</p>
<p>I could write thousands of words about various crappy situations I&#8217;ve been in. In fact, I&#8217;m sure <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/never-late-share-story-sexual-assault/" target="_blank">most of us could write a story of sexual assault</a>. Why is my kiss or my kindness constantly mistaken as an invitation for sex? Why am I terrified to stand up for myself <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/heres-street-harassment-affects-womens-mental-health-heal/" target="_blank">in the face of cat-callers</a>? Why am I expected to smile and be pleasant to protect a man’s ego? Why is the closest thing I&#8217;ve felt to being empowered as a woman the times when I&#8217;ve had to push a guy off of me and tell him to stop touching me? And when will I — and my friends, and every other woman — feel unafraid to say “no”?</p>
<p>Maybe now, reaching a point where I am brave enough to put this all out into the world, I’m finally experiencing my moment of empowerment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“I don&#8217;t have the life I expected to have,” says Shayla Maas, a disabled woman who was an adolescent psychiatric nurse before her Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome progressed to a point that made it difficult to work. When a series of injuries then left her transitioning to light duty and eventually forced her out of the workplace, it was a total sea change.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/miscellaneous/cb12-134.html" target="_blank" rel"nofollow">According to the U.S. Census</a>, nearly 20 percent of Americans are disabled. Some have congenital disabilities they’ve lived with their whole lives. Others have faced traumatic accidents, diagnoses of chronic conditions, and other life changes — sometimes at the height of a busy career, or while pursuing dreams with tremendous physical demands. A newly-acquired disability — or the diagnosis of a previously unidentified chronic condition — represents a tremendous life change, one that can be very isolating.</p>
<p><span id="more-9210"></span></p>
<p>Amanda Rausch of Talkspace notes that an acquired disability can be accompanied by a grieving period. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/finding-help-complicated-grief/" target="_blank">Grief isn’t limited</a> to an emotional reaction to the death of a loved one — other kinds of loss can spark intense emotions, including not just sorrow but also fear, rage, anxiety, discomfort in the body, and feelings of alienation.</p>
<p>Learning to cope with this big life change is known in the disability community as the “adjustment period,” and the first thing to understand about it if you’re facing it, or watching a loved one go through it, is that you’re not alone. Many people have been through it before, and along the way, they’ve learned things that will help you.</p>
<h2>There’s hope for people with newly-acquired disabilities.</h2>
<p>The adjustment period can be challenging on its own, as it involves adapting to accommodate the demands of your body in ways that might feel unfamiliar, or even scary. “I wasn&#8217;t excited about needing an ostomy and having to poop in a bag for the rest of my life, but I was looking forward to feeling better and actually getting to participate in my life again,” says Jennifer Brown, who needed an ileostomy to treat complications of Crohn’s disease.</p>
<p>But it can be hard for another reason, too: The social attitudes surrounding disability. It’s not uncommon for non-disabled people to have minimal social contact with disabled people, while being surrounded by media that depicts disability as a tragedy, and a bad thing.</p>
<p>You’re probably used to hearing lines like “she’ll never dance again” or “her <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/what-is-crippling-depression/" target="_blank">crippling depression</a> made it impossible to work.” Or, conversely, you hear the success stories that seem impossible to match, like the Paralympic athletes who compete at the top of their sport, or amputees who summit Everest.</p>
<p>When you suddenly learn that you’re disabled — whether via a somber conversation in your doctor’s office about some test results or when you wake up in a hospital bed and realize something is very, <em>very</em> different — and you have no contact with the disability community, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/03/how-you-can-beat-anxiety-with-mindful-breathing/" target="_blank">it’s anxiety-producing</a>, and a lot to cope with.</p>
<p>Lacking frame of reference or role models, some people feel very lost, something Maas commented on. “I didn’t connect with the disability community until well after I had adjusted,” says Maas, who noted that she learned a lot of things the hard way, and sometimes developed tricks and shortcuts that were, in the long term, harmful — but she didn’t have any resources to point her in the right direction.</p>
<h2>Talk therapy helps newly-disabled people adjust.</h2>
<p>David Kaplan, the Chief Professional Officer of the American Counseling Association, says that while the basic medical needs should be taken care of first, getting people into group counseling is critical. With a caveat, he notes: The group should include a mixture of newly-disabled people and others who may be struggling to cope, and those with experience who have gone through the adjustment period and can act as mentors and supportive team members.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/06/tried-therapy-10-reasons-try/" target="_blank">Individual counseling</a> can also be tremendously beneficial. Rausch says that helping people come to terms with disability and its role in their lives can be an ongoing process, and includes holding space for what has changed, while looking forward to the future. She encourages her clients to think of their lives and identities like a wheel, with themselves at the center, and all the influences around them emerging as spokes: Maybe that’s mother, dietician, wife, cook, lover of romance novels. Disability may emerge as another spoke, she says, but it shouldn’t consume that center spot, and being around people who share that experience can be helpful.</p>
<p>Maas’ medical team didn’t make moves to connect her with fellow disabled people, and Brown had a similar experience. While nurses taught her about the basic management of her ileostomy site in the hospital, they sent her home with pamphlets which were “obviously aimed at someone in their 60s, not a 28-year-old.” For both, it was the internet that led them to communities of people with shared experiences. “I stopped thinking of it entirely as chronically ill, and started thinking of it as disability, and it doesn’t have to be entirely a bad thing,” says Maas. “Maybe it was a second adjustment period.”</p>
<p>There’s also a field of counseling that specifically applies to helping people adjust: Rehabilitation counseling. Just as people may have physical rehab to help them learn to use mobility devices, learn more about physical limitations, or re-learn certain skills, counseling can provide them with important coping techniques, says Kaplan.</p>
<h2>Transitioning into a different life isn’t the end.</h2>
<p>Both Kaplan and Rausch note that feelings of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/05/how-much-do-you-really-know-about-loneliness/" target="_blank">isolation, extreme loneliness,</a> despair, and/or hopelessness are a bad sign. People facing newly-acquired disabilities who feel themselves slipping away from the world might want to get proactive about seeking counseling and community. Their friends and loved ones can also offer support — that may include things like connecting people with services, helping out around the house, or just making a point to spend time with people while they explore their new lives. “If you can adapt a little thing,” Maas says, it will bring you one step closer to comfort in your body, and that, in turn, can bring you one step closer to adjustment.</p>
<p>“The transition is hard. It sucks, there is no doubt. Things are not going to be the same, but you will learn to adjust and it will become normal. Once you&#8217;re through the transition you will be yourself again, if a slightly different version,” says Brown. “Try to find people to joke about it with if you can.” She acknowledges that it’s okay to feel sad or angry or frustrated, too, or to wish that you weren’t disabled.</p>
<p>There’s no right or wrong trajectory for adapting to disability.<br />
Some people find themselves joining the disability pride movement and beginning radically new chapters of activism in their lives. Others settle into their new selves, but don’t necessarily embrace disability as part of their identity. Learning about the different models of disability — <a href="https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/accessability/staff/accessabilitytutors/information-for-accessability-tutors/the-social-and-medical-model-of-disability" target="_blank" rel"nofollow">social and medical being the most common</a> — and connecting with people who share your experience can be a powerful inoculation against isolation and fear, and there’s no shame in seeking support to help you come to terms with a big life change.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to a Center for Disease Control (CDC) <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf" target="_blank">National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey</a>, one in six U.S. men have experienced sexual violence, and 17% of those men develop symptoms of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/the-history-of-ptsd/" target="_blank">post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</a>. In my years practicing <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a>, I’ve found male survivors face unique challenges to recovery, yet hesitate to get the help they need.</p>
<p>The question is why.</p>
<p>For one, we don’t hear much about male sexual assault survivors, although one <a href="https://www.jimhopper.com/pdfs/Dube_(2005)_Childhood_sexual_abuse_by_gender_of_victim.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> found sexual assault history was common among both women and men, reported by 25% of women and 16% of men surveyed. The research participants also faced similar long-term problems, regardless of gender.</p>
<p><span id="more-9131"></span></p>
<p>This same study found both male and female victims faced increased risk for <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/who-should-you-share-your-addiction-and-recovery-with/" target="_blank">substance abuse</a>, relationship problems, and suicide attempts. In addition to PTSD symptoms, the aforementioned CDC report also found male and female survivors experience physical problems such as headaches, chronic pain, or gastrointestinal symptoms.</p>
<h2>The Gender Gap</h2>
<p>In my clinical experience, I’ve seen that males and females each bring distinct concerns to therapy. Unfortunately, there remains a significant gender gap in research on sexual victimization — and that keeps the conversations about sexual violence often limited to female survivors.</p>
<p>Of course, this gap also affects mental health and general medical care. In fact, according to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4116270/pdf/permj18_3p0082.pdf" target="_blank">a 2014 study</a>, doctors treating male survivors of sexual assault have far fewer guidelines available to them than physicians treating females do.</p>
<p>Simply put, male survivors have more trouble than female survivors finding knowledgeable providers when they seek help.</p>
<h2>Stereotypes and Power</h2>
<p>In my work with male survivors, I’ve found abuse brings up challenges to the conditioning we&#8217;ve all received about gender identity — specifically, what it means to “be a man.”</p>
<p>Because common male stereotypes value toughness, males must contend with society’s expectations that they remain strong and silent.</p>
<p>Stereotypes suggest men enjoy heterosexual experiences of any kind, so some feel unmasculine if a sexual interaction makes them uncomfortable. For example, boys abused by women sometimes wonder if there’s something wrong with them for reporting it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the majority of people who commit sexual assault are male. In the case of a male perpetrator and heterosexual victim, survivors may struggle with questions about gender identity and sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Sexual assault often revolves more around power than gender. Male survivors also face feelings of powerlessness, wondering why they weren’t “man enough” to stop abuse.</p>
<h2>Coping Mechanisms and Treatment Barriers</h2>
<p>Men who have experienced sexual assault are more likely to engage in risky behaviors or substance abuse to cope with complex feelings. These problems may bring men into treatment, but they mask the underlying issues. When men feel uncomfortable disclosing assault, therapy can be less effective.</p>
<p>Because many male survivors experienced assault at the hands of an authority figure (think coach or youth leader), they having trouble trusting other authorities — even doctors. These men avoid medical care, even though the sexual assault also makes them more likely to have health problems.</p>
<h2>Getting Help</h2>
<p>Even with these unique challenges, therapy and other medical interventions can reduce the impact of assault history on overall health and well-being. If you decide <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/7-self-care-tips-for-sexual-assault-survivors/" target="_blank">to get help for yourself</a> or a loved one, consider the following guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Ask Questions First</strong></p>
<p>When you’re calling <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/08/the-different-types-of-therapists-and-counselors-the-complete-guide/" target="_blank">new therapists</a>, ask about their experience working with male survivors of sexual assault. If you need a doctor for a physical problem, ask for an appointment to talk about your history and concerns first, even before you go in for a physical exam.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate Your Needs</strong></p>
<p>Let providers know how they can make you more comfortable. You can request they move at a slower pace, explain treatments thoroughly, and ask permission before any new intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Plan for Setbacks</strong></p>
<p>Feelings of powerlessness and other triggers in treatment can send your coping mechanisms flying out the window. Develop a plan with your provider for how you’ll handle distress, perhaps by taking a break to regain composure or briefly changing topics.</p>
<p><strong>Look for Signs of a Good Match</strong></p>
<p>Does the provider respond to your assault story with close attention and a supportive tone? Does the provider explain interventions, answer questions, and seek your input?</p>
<h2>The Therapeutic Relationship</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">Most therapists, myself included, welcome feedback</a> to make you more comfortable through a difficult process. Therapy is hard work, but it’s a collaborative relationship. Being open with your therapist about your feelings in the here and now, within that relationship, brings about the best care.</p>
<p>Although male survivors of sexual assault face distinct challenges receiving the treatment they need, it is possible to find knowledgeable, sensitive providers who can help you face those challenges.</p>
<p>What’s more, coming forward with your experiences not only helps you feel better, but helps the medical community better understand the needs of this too-often silent group.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the #MeToo movement dominating the headlines over the past few months, many of us have had to ask tough questions about our own experiences of gender, power, and relationships. While women have taken the forefront of the movement, it’s also been a moment of reckoning for men.</p>
<p>The movement has not only provided an opportunity to confront more obvious acts of violence, but also how <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/12/how-much-effort-do-women-put-into-coping-with-sexual-harassment-in-a-day/" target="_blank">gender roles influence the way we treat one another</a> in our own lives and relationships. This means confronting the role of toxic masculinity in our lives and relationships.</p>
<p><span id="more-9094"></span></p>
<h2>What is toxic masculinity?</h2>
<p>Toxic masculinity is a term for some of the harmful associations of “maleness” in our culture. It doesn’t mean that masculinity is bad or that it is bad to be a man. It does mean, however, that some traits associated with masculinity in our culture are harmful or toxic for both men and women’s mental, physical, emotional, and relationship health.</p>
<p>We can all think of examples of toxic masculinity: the idea that it’s “unmanly” or “weak” to express one’s feelings or to cry; the idea that men should judge their own value on how many women they have sex with; or the idea that men should get into fights with one another to express their dominance, for example.</p>
<h2>Who does toxic masculinity affect?</h2>
<p><a href="http://inthesetimes.com/article/20303/the-antidote-to-toxic-masculinity" target="_blank">A term coined</a> by men’s movements aiming to question stereotypical notions of masculinity, “toxic masculinity” has been shown to be <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/mental-health-feminist-issue/" target="_blank">detrimental not only for women, but for men’s mental health</a>.</p>
<p>Many traits we associate with toxic masculinity specifically cause harm to women. The belief that men are entitled to women’s bodies or sexuality, for example, often underlies sexual harassment and violence, and research shows that men <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0891243202016003007" target="_blank">use these beliefs</a> to justify harassment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the belief that it’s not “manly” to do domestic labor or care for children maintains <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/12/housework-men-assert-masculinity" target="_blank">the unequal burden of housework on women</a>.</p>
<p>Women’s rights and dignity are enough of a reason for men to be self-critical and pledge to encourage healthier forms of masculinity. But the truth is, while toxic masculinity may provide men some privileges, it is harmful to their mental, emotional, and physical health overall.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/cou-cou0000176.pdf" target="_blank">A meta-analysis of studies</a> following over 20,000 men found that men who believed in and practiced behaviors associated with toxic masculinity had worse mental health and were less likely to seek help. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743515003813" target="_blank">research has also found</a> that the stoicism associated with toxic masculinity prevents men from communicating with their doctors, with negative effects on men’s physical health.</p>
<p>Toxic masculinity is also bad for relationships, increasing the likelihood of men’s perpetration of relationship violence. And even without physical violence, toxic masculinity leads to <a href="http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1041&amp;context=psycd_fac" target="_blank">less satisfying romantic relationships</a> overall.</p>
<h2>How can men address toxic masculinity?</h2>
<p>Confronting toxic masculinity in your own life and behavior may challenge your own sense of identity and social acceptance. But self-criticism and change are full of rewards, bringing with with them the opportunity for deeper, healthier relationships with ourselves, our partners, and our communities. Here’s how to start.</p>
<h2>Educate yourself.</h2>
<p>Learn about what toxic masculinity is and how our culture reinforces it. Read women’s accounts of how this behavior has harmed them, and take them seriously. Be open to what you’re reading and learning and remember that while it may make you feel bad or defensive, the problem originates in our culture broadly—and you have the power to fix the problem.</p>
<h2>Work on yourself.</h2>
<p>Being self-critical is hard, but it’s worth it. As you learn about the negative effects of toxic masculinity, reflect on how these may have affected your own life. Don’t be afraid to ask for help from a qualified therapist. And if you’ve ever committed intimate partner violence or sexual violence, it’s absolutely necessary to work with a therapist to prevent yourself from perpetrating again.</p>
<h2>Be accountable.</h2>
<p>Mistakes are human. Taking accountability is the true measure of a person’s worth. If any of the women in your life say you have harmed them, take them seriously, listen openly, and apologize earnestly. Don’t give excuses. Don’t blame the person who has been harmed. Being genuinely accountable is not only the right thing to do, it’s the only way we can all move forward.</p>
<h2>Create better communities.</h2>
<p>Public conversations about the #MeToo movement have often focused on what we imagine men will lose by being held accountable for <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/7-self-care-tips-for-sexual-assault-survivors/" target="_blank">violent or sexist behavior</a>. But what if we focused instead on what changing toxic masculinity would help us gain?</p>
<p>By giving up harmful notions of masculinity we stand to gain something deeply human and profound, far better than any superficial privilege: Increased intimacy, community, and healthier relationships with our love ones and ourselves.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;<a href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/as-workplaces-discuss-sexual-harassment-prevention-are-they-neglecting-treatment" target="_blank">As Workplaces Discuss Sexual Harassment Prevention, Are They Neglecting Treatment?</a>&#8221; originally appeared on <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/" target="_blank">Fairygodboss</a>, an online career community for women, by women. </em></p>
<p>In the wake of the #MeToo movement, workplaces across the country are discussing how to prevent <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/career-topics/sexual-harassment-laws" target="_blank">sexual harassment</a> and penalize guilty employees. But, like all national issues, it’s important to not only consider prevention, but also treatment for those already affected.</p>
<p>New research published in the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology warns that sexual <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/hostile-work-environment" target="_blank">harassment</a> at work is a “chronic problem” for women in the workplace — one that can cause lasting mental illness.<span id="more-8781"></span></p>
<p>Researchers analyzed data from the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Fair Employment Practices agencies and found that, while the total number of complaints actually fell 28.5 percent from 1997 to 2011, women who experience <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/career-topics/sexual-harassment-in-the-workplace" target="_blank">sexual harassment</a> at work are more likely to suffer from <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/5-ways-of-coping-with-anxiety-at-work" target="_blank">anxiety</a>, depression, eating disorders and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study also found that female victims have a tendency to abuse alcohol and drugs in an effort to cope, and they have lower levels of overall happiness.</p>
<p>Of course, just because the number of recorded complaints has fallen doesn’t mean that <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/career-topics/dealing-with-sexual-harassment-at-work" target="_blank">sexual harassment</a> in the workplace has decreased. The research found that hierarchical power dynamics are at the root of sexual harassment, and we know all too well how true that is given the surge of women in Hollywood publicly coming forward with their stories. In the sexual harassment stories of Rose McGowan to Angelina Jolie to Gwyneth Paltrow and more, power dynamics play a big role.</p>
<p>While the number of male victims has risen more than 15 percent in just 15 years — and we’ve heard from more men like Anthony Rapp who came forward alleging sexual advances from Kevin Spacey — the report found that men do not find their experiences as anxiety-inducing or upsetting as women, and women still continue to file the bulk of complaints. This is neither to discount men’s stories nor undermine their experiences, but it is to understand just how “chronic” a problem workplace sexual harassment can be for female victims, in particular.</p>
<p>Regardless of one’s gender identity, as evermore people come forward, companies should be making strides to help victims of harassment cope with the aftermath.</p>
<p>“Harassment can cause PTSD and physical health problems as a result of the stress of the harassment and the stress that reporting and dealing with it causes,” says Jennifer Hancock, who teaches how to stop harassment using <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/career-topics/sexual-harassment-training" target="_blank">behavioral training</a> techniques at Humanist Learning Systems. “For instance, when I was being stalked, I was so nervous I developed a <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/how-to-not-be-nervous" target="_blank">nervous</a> bladder, which required medical treatment and medicines.”</p>
<p>While there have been payouts to those who’ve won harassment claims, Hancock says companies should be considering the mental and physical effects of bullying workplace injuries and pay for both mental and physical treatment accordingly.</p>
<p>“We really need to normalize mental health treatment and help people understand that some of their physical symptoms may be related,” she says. “Very few people have the skills to cope with harassment on their own, and mental health professionals can have a huge impact in a very short amount of time, so it’s money well spent.”</p>
<p>Approximately one in five adults in the U.S., or 43.8 million Americans, experiences mental illness in a given year, according to the <a href="https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-By-the-Numbers" target="_blank">National Alliance on Mental Illness</a>. Almost 10 million Americans experience a serious mental illness in a given year that substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities — such as, say, their careers.</p>
<p>Mood disorders like depression are the third most common cause of hospitalization in the country for both youth and adults aged 18 to 44, which means that it can keep employees out of work. And those living with serious mental illnesses also face the increased risk of chronic medical conditions, which means that they die, on average, 25 years earlier than everyone else. This is largely due to treatable medical conditions, but less than half of American adults with a mental health condition received mental health services in the past year.</p>
<p>So while companies work on preventing the perpetuation of mental health problems, perhaps they should also consider how they can contribute to the costs of counseling and other treatments for PTSD, anxiety, eating disorders and drinking and drug problems.</p>
<p>“We have definitely seen an uptick in the kinds of companies, both big and small, that reach out and react in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein crisis,” says Stephany Zoo, executive director of <a href="http://www.phoenixrisen.org/" target="_blank">Phoenix Risen</a>, a World Economic Forum-supported nonprofit that brings men and women together to talk about sexual harassment. Phoenix Risen’s interactive empathy workshop, for example, asks both men and women to break down power dynamics, set boundaries and learn to also communicate nonverbally.</p>
<p>Zoo adds that people are not only reporting more incidents, but the news of sexual harassment in Hollywood and elsewhere is also triggering past traumas for many victims, and it’s critical that companies recognize that.</p>
<p>“Most companies, may not have existing resources to provide counseling and support to their employees, but you can always partner with local grassroots organizations,” Zoo advises. “For example <a href="https://www.rainn.org/" target="_blank">RAINN</a> has a national 24/7 hotline, and city-specific resources are available on their website.”</p>
<p>She also says that it’s time for companies to revisit their sexual harassment policies.</p>
<p>“Are all the facets of implementation in place?” she asks. “Does your HR team actually have the training to deal with these situations? You can also do an internal survey to measure efficacy. Have a town hall meeting to be pro-active about your stance on sexual violation in the workplace and let your employees know that their welfare and safety matters to the company. This more than just a legal precaution, but speaking from an angle of safe spaces and culture.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the Civil Rights Movement, white psychologists invented a so-called mental illness. Dubbing it “<a href="https://www.theroot.com/schizophrenia-as-political-weapon-1790878403" target="_blank">protest psychosis</a>,” these psychologists used the racially-motivated “syndrome” to explain away the reasonable rage of black Americans demanding an end to segregation.</p>
<p>Sixty years later, <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/apa-blog/2017/10/racism-and-mental-health" target="_blank">racial disparities</a> in the mental health care system remain, including lack of access to mental health services for communities of color, inadequate addressal of the real psychological trauma caused by racism, and racially-motivated diagnoses like the now-scrapped “protest psychosis.”</p>
<p>But that doesn’t have to be the case. Increasingly, anti-racist advocates in the mental health community are encouraging us all to recognize mental health as a racial justice issue.<span id="more-8763"></span></p>
<h2>Racism Is a Mental Health Issue</h2>
<p>As a consequence of systemic racism, people of color in the United States, and particularly black people, suffer higher rates of mental illness than white Americans.</p>
<p>Trauma due to racism causes a near-constant sense of insecurity for many people of color, which leads to physical stress and <a href="https://www-tc.pbs.org/wgbh/takeonestep/depression/pdf/dep_color.pdf" target="_blank">increased risk</a> of depression and anxiety. People of color as a whole are also <a href="https://www.self.com/story/racism-mental-health-in-the-black-community" target="_blank">10% more likely</a>, and black people are 20% more likely, than white people to report serious psychological distress. The very <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/apa-blog/2017/10/racism-and-mental-health" target="_blank">anticipation of racism</a> can have deleterious physical and emotional health effects, and this stress builds up over time.</p>
<p>Witnessing or being a victim of racial trauma can cause post-traumatic stress disorder, particularly prevalent in the current political climate. Following the shooting of Michael Brown, <a href="http://media.wix.com/ugd/c555ee_a5e4f4137a484ab68ebb4bd7bf8c39dd.pdf" target="_blank">one study</a> found that 34% percent of the Ferguson, Missouri, community, and 14% of police officers, demonstrated symptoms fitting the definition of PTSD.</p>
<p>Racism further compounds with poverty to put people of color, disproportionately low-income, at <a href="https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/docs/byomm_fulltoolkit.pdf" target="_blank">added risk</a>.</p>
<h2>But Racism Is Also a Part of the Mental Healthcare System</h2>
<p>While mental healthcare should be a right for everyone, it’s difficult to access for most Americans — and systemic racism makes this even more challenging for people of color.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of Americans of all races with depression don’t get treatment, and black people are <a href="https://www.self.com/story/racism-mental-health-in-the-black-community" target="_blank">even less likely</a> to receive appropriate care. As a result of this structural inequality, many people of color suffering from mental illness, and particularly black Americans, are <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0020731416662736" target="_blank">more likely</a> to be sent to jail than to access adequate care.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/06/the-struggle-of-seeking-therapy-while-poor/484970/" target="_blank">More than half of all counties</a> in the United States lack a certified mental health worker to begin with, and even those communities that do have therapy services often lack options for low-income residents. Many low-income people and especially people of color lack health insurance, but even if they do have it, many therapists don’t accept insurance at all — and people of color are disproportionately unable to pay steep out-of-pocket costs.</p>
<p>And finding a therapist who accepts insurance is no guarantee of receiving quality care. In one <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022146516647098" target="_blank">study</a>, researchers found that therapists discriminated against potential clients presenting as low-income and black, even if they had insurance.</p>
<p>Finally, as the story of “protest psychosis” demonstrates, psychology has a racist history of treating people of color as illogical or disordered, rather than understanding that experiences of racism are a form of trauma. Anger at a racist system makes sense. For example, racially discriminatory judgements cause providers to diagnose black men with schizophrenia four to five times <a href="https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ps.20120p847" target="_blank">more often</a> than the general population.</p>
<p>These systemic problems lead many people of color to be understandably reluctant to seek mental healthcare and deprive people of color of their right to treatment.</p>
<h2>Activists Are Taking Action</h2>
<p>From community-level campaigns to provider training, mental health advocates are confronting racism. Their efforts are vital reading whether you’re a person of color seeking care, a provider, or an ally.</p>
<h2>Community Campaigns</h2>
<p>From campaigns to destigmatize mental illness in communities of color, like Dior Vargas’s “<a href="http://diorvargas.com/poc-mental-illness" target="_blank">POC and Mental Illness Photo Project</a>” to resources like the “<a href="https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/docs/byomm_fulltoolkit.pdf" target="_blank">Brother, You’re on My Mind</a>” toolkit for leading conversations about depression among black men, community advocates are sparking dialogue on mental health. Numerous organizations also offer <a href="https://www.bgdblog.org/2014/12/going-therapy-qtpoc-without-harmed-erased-baffled-therapy-horror-stories-may-heard/" target="_blank">actionable tips</a> for people of color seeking mental healthcare and <a href="https://www.nami.org/getmedia/96871c65-293b-42cb-9697-091897cfd8bd/flyer_culturallycompetentproviders2016" target="_blank">resources</a> for accessing culturally-sensitive care.</p>
<h2>Training Medical Providers</h2>
<p>In 2001, the American Psychological Association released a <a href="http://www.apa.org/about/policy/racism.aspx" target="_blank">statement against racism</a>. This stance reflects a broader shift in the field, with professional associations and providers increasingly emphasizing culturally competent care, meaning that mental healthcare providers should be sensitive to clients’ cultural backgrounds, gender and sexualities, and experiences of oppression. At a governmental level, the federal Office of Behavioral Health Equity has begun to address the lack of people of color in the mental health field through <a href="http://thenationshealth.aphapublications.org/content/45/1/1.3.full" target="_blank">campaigns</a> and fellowships to train psychologists of color.</p>
<h2>Improving Access</h2>
<p>Achieving truly equitable, anti-racist mental healthcare is a long-term process since it means fighting racism and poverty on a society-wide level. But technological interventions can help increase access within the current healthcare system. Therapy apps and online therapy, for example, can both provide more affordable care and can cut down on therapists’ rejection of clients for racially discriminatory reasons.</p>
<h2>Everyone Has a Right to Mental Health</h2>
<p>The mental health system shares our society’s wider history of racism, with an ugly legacy of treating people of color as disordered rather than acknowledging their real experiences of trauma and oppression. But alongside the tireless efforts of advocates, we can work toward a mental healthcare system that delivers on the promise of health and healing from systemic racism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s that knot of anxiety in the pit of your stomach when you walk down the street. You step off the train, your bag in front of your breasts, flinching lest the next passerby brush you “accidentally-on-purpose.”</p>
<p>It’s never knowing whether your boss is leaning just a <em>little</em> too close.</p>
<p>It’s turning the music up loud so you don’t hear the catcallers, or turning down an invitation to a work outing because the coworker who’s going has a reputation for getting handsy when he’s drunk.<span id="more-8618"></span></p>
<p>In the course of an average day, women spend an incredible amount of time and energy attempting to avoid sexual harassment — and thanks to recent research, we now know how much. This time and effort is called “safety work,” and it <em>is</em> work: All those moments of self-censorship, of adjusting our behavior, of choosing what we wear or where we go based, not on our real desires, but on fear for our safety, aren’t just minor annoyances. They have a major effect on our mental health, from daily stress to effects as serious as post traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p>A recent group of feminist researchers has elaborated how “safety work” exacts a toll on women’s everyday lives. UK-based researcher Liz Kelly has <a href="http://www.nottinghamshire.pcc.police.uk/Document-Library/News-and-Events/Chance-for-Change/Professor-Liz-Kelly-Chance-for-Change-Presentation.pdf" target="_blank">argued</a> that safety work is the labor that women are forced to do in order to try to keep ourselves safe from domestic and sexual violence, in a world in which this violence is not an occasional incident but an overwhelming daily threat.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qESTDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=fiona+vera-grey&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=fiona%20vera-grey&amp;f=false" target="_blank">researcher</a> Fiona Vera-Gray writes in her work on street harassment, women are constantly forced to navigate the world anticipating invasive sexual or gender-based “intrusions” by men. While the women in Vera-Gray’s study reported experiencing street harassment on average once every couple days, anticipating these intrusions and planning for them occupied a good deal of women’s thought and time in public on a daily basis, thus causing them to alter their behavior — and subjecting them to near-constant stress.</p>
<p>We cannot ever truly prevent sexual violence and harassment, because it’s not our fault — it’s the choice of the aggressor and of a sexist society. Even so, the burden of assessing our own risk constantly falls on women’s heads, and we learn strategies to make ourselves feel more comfortable in the hopes of getting through the day in peace. When in public space, some of these strategies may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wearing headphones to prevent male strangers from talking to us</li>
<li>Wearing sunglasses so men can’t see our eyes or facial expressions</li>
<li>Changing our walking routes to avoid harassment</li>
<li>Changing the way we dress in an attempt to avoid attention</li>
<li>Arranging our facial expressions to look hostile, disinterested or neutral in the hopes of avoiding attention or even comments to “smile.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Do any of these behaviors ring a bell? If they do, you may also find yourself undertaking safety work in other spaces — like the workplace and the home.</p>
<p>At work, we may avoid meeting certain male coworkers alone, dress a certain way, or hesitate to speak up. And for those of us who have struggled with physical, emotional, or sexual abuse in our intimate lives, we may adjust our behavior in the home as well — we may avoid certain relatives, walk on eggshells around volatile partners, and develop other methods to cope with violent domestic space.</p>
<p>As the research on safety work demonstrates, we’re not just hurt when sexual harassment happens — our mental health also takes a toll from the near-constant <em>anticipation</em> of harassment. Since our thoughts are always half-occupied with monitoring our bodies and the space around us, we lose the freedom to think about other things, to move and speak as we please, and to simply enjoy the solace of our own minds — a constant worry that Vera-Grey calls a “habituated external awareness.” This can in turn lead to negative mental health effects like <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/dealing-depression-need-know/" target="_blank">depression</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/when-does-normal-anxiety-become-a-mental-illness/" target="_blank">anxiety</a>, body image issues, and can exacerbate the trauma we may have from other experiences of gendered violence.</p>
<p>And because harassment is so normalized in our society, it’s not only other people who fail to notice “safety work” — we often don’t even register the toll that trying to keep ourselves safe takes on us. While we can’t eliminate sexual harassment overnight, we <em>can</em> learn to give ourselves and each other support as we build a world where all of us can enjoy the basic right to safety and personal freedom. We can begin by allowing ourselves to acknowledge how much work we actually do, how much effort we’re making, and how those efforts really can drain us.</p>
<p>Next time you go about your day, ask yourself: Are you also engaging in safety work you might not have previously recognized? If you are (and many of us do!), don’t be afraid to acknowledge how you may feel — annoyed, exhausted, anxious — to yourself, to loved ones, and even to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talkspace" target="_blank">online therapist</a>. And don’t be afraid to give yourself the care and understanding that you need. We all deserve spaces where we can drop our vigilance and simply enjoy the solace of our own minds.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;<a href="http://pubx.co/wezWoU" target="_blank">An Open Letter to My Catcallers On My Way to Work</a>&#8221; originally appeared on <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/" target="_blank">Fairygodboss</a>, an online career community for women, by women.</em></p>
<p>Dear Catcallers On My Way to Work This Morning,</p>
<p>Like a stray hair that slinks down the skin of my back, I can feel your eyes. Like the Spanx under my skirt you strip away with your mind, your words suffocate me.</p>
<p>On my way to the office, I saunter through Manhattan’s Herald Square. It’s crawling with wide-eyed tourists, to whom you’re supposed to be passing flyers and ushering onto double-decker buses. You call me an, ahem, part of the female anatomy because I won’t smile for you. I grip my keys between my knuckles, and I flash you the finger.<span id="more-8542"></span></p>
<p>At <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/easy-lunch-ideas" target="_blank">lunch</a>, you take a break from jackhammering the sidewalk to <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/career-topics/sexual-harassment-definition" target="_blank">thrust your hips and hump thin air</a>. You swallow your dangling tongue to ask me where I’m heading. I cross the street. On a good day, you’ll say, “God bless,” and give up. But on most days, you’ll hurl more curse words at me for not entertaining your offer.</p>
<p>Sporting your gray suit that matches your gray hair, another one of you tells me that, if I let you take care of me, I&#8217;ll never have to work. With your briefcase in hand, you wave me over. I choose to pretend I don&#8217;t hear you.</p>
<p>It’s daylight savings now, and I seldom leave my desk before the night falls. But I can still see you, shrouded in darkness but illumined by the display of your phone. When you’re on foot, you follow me home some blocks before you grow <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/career-topics/bored-at-work" target="_blank">bored</a>. I’m not on the phone with anyone; I’m drowning out the details of your disgusting desires, hoping that my preoccupied negligence might deter you. When you stalk me by car, you roll down the window to whistle and whisper dirty nothings; you drive sluggishly at my pace. I snap a photo of your face, or your license plate, and I dial the police. Sometimes you show aggression but, ultimately, you dart or drive off.</p>
<p>One time, you snapped a photo up my skirt. I’m still not sure if I prefer that to the time you spit on me.</p>
<p>I used to want to ask you how you’d feel if someone treated your mother, sister, or daughter like a butcher does meat. I used to feel inclined to ask you why — what do you actually think you’ll accomplish? But I know you have little to no regard for my thoughts; and I know you wouldn’t know how to handle a woman who welcomed your advances anyway.</p>
<p>In fact, I used to be afraid of you. I used to take different routes to the office to avoid you, but evermore of you lurk around each corner. So I wouldn’t prove an amusing target, I used to plug headphones in my ears — with no music, so I could still hear you in case your words were threatening.</p>
<p>As a woman, I’m a dauntless protagonist of my own life but, as women, we&#8217;ve all been conditioned to fear the same horror stories. Horror stories in which you, catcaller, are cast as the lead antagonist. It’s because we boast an education system that fails to <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/tips-for-handling-bullies-at-work" target="_blank">discipline our bullies</a>, endorse a media landscape deficient in our voices but replete with those of our oppressors, and laud a <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/should-i-go-to-law-school" target="_blank">legal structure</a> perfused with patriarchy. Women, like me, are told to tolerate life as passive victims of traditions among boys who will be boys in a world beset by bigotry, exacerbated by the objectification of our bodies as weapons of war, global gendercide, sex trafficking, and the sheer notion that one of the most developed nations in the world chalks sexual assault up to “locker room talk.”</p>
<p>When conditioned fear couples with a dwindling hope for deliverance in a society that promotes an agenda that too often negates our own, women become perpetually paralyzed by the thralldom of “what if.” What if you actually do the things you say you want to do to my body? What if you do snatch me up in your truck on my walk home? For a lot of us, the politics of life with a vagina becomes the bane of our existence.</p>
<p>But I won’t allow it anymore. And the more you’ve hounded and humped, loitered and licked your lips, coaxed and cursed, the more I’ve unfortunately gotten used to it all as the norm, and the more I&#8217;ve realized how unafraid I am these days. The more I’ve realized, I’m not scared — you are.</p>
<p>You’re afraid that a woman, on her way to work, might just <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/independent-women-quotes" target="_blank">change the world</a> as we know it.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re afraid that a working woman, afforded a voice, might just shut you up one day — and not by flipping you the bird or calling the police but, rather, by rising to a position you wouldn&#8217;t dare disrespect.</p>
<p>So, I’m ready when you are. When you really think you’re ready to handle a real response to those catcalls, let’s talk. Until then, I’ve got a job to crush.</p>
<p>Unapologetically,</p>
