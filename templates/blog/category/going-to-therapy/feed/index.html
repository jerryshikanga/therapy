				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you think of therapy, a stereotypical scenario comes to mind: A person lying on a dusty leather couch while some guy with a small notepad sits somewhere by their head, or perhaps across from them, jotting down insights as they speak, probably about their twisted relationship with their parents.</p>
<p>There’s some truth to this scenario (the couch does always seem to be leather, no?), and while talking about your childhood it isn’t the case for all therapy interactions, it is for reparenting.<br />
<span id="more-10905"></span></p>
<h2>Reparenting Defined</h2>
<p>Reparenting — also called ‘limited reparenting’ — is when a psychotherapist takes the role of a concerned and trustworthy parent so the client can learn what a trusting relationship is like.</p>
<p>“Reparenting helps an individual repair attachments and develop more secure and healthy relationships,” said Rachel O’Neill, an Ohio-licensed professional counselor and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/join-as-a-therapist" target="_blank">Talkspace therapist</a>. “It can help an individual recognize and repair patterns of non-functional behavior.”</p>
<p>Reparenting is based on the belief that many psychological issues stem from a child growing up without his or her needs being met. The child is not <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/online-therapy-is-a-godsend-for-busy-parents/" target="_blank">made to feel secure and unconditionally loved</a>, so they grow up to be an adult who can’t navigate relationships and life as well as they should.</p>
<h2>The Three Aspects of Reparenting</h2>
<p>Reparenting deals with three theoretical aspects of an individual. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adult</li>
<li>Inner Child</li>
<li>Parent</li>
</ul>
<p>The Adult is the individual today. The Inner Child is the childhood stage at which the individual was wronged. The Parent is a therapist (or an individual) who gives the right response the child should have received. Reparenting is going back to the stage in which the adult was wronged as a child, and satisfying or making peace with the inner child hidden inside. This is done by giving the satisfactory response and fulfilling the needs that were required at that time by self-counseling or therapy.</p>
<h2><b>Forms of Reparenting </b></h2>
<p>Over the years a number of reparenting forms have been tested, three of these include:</p>
<h3><b>Total Regression </b></h3>
<p>Developed by Jaqui Lee Schiff, this <a href="https://rossaforbes.com/reparenting-and-jacqui-schiff/" target="_blank">controversial form of reparenting</a> was the first form of therapy derived from <a href="http://www.ericberne.com/transactional-analysis/" target="_blank">transactional analysis theory</a>. Typically, the patient lives with the therapist for up to several years at an institution. During this time, the patient is totally immersed in the reliving of his or her childhood. The <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a> provides all the care and nurturing with the goal of totally reforming the client&#8217;s parent ego state.</p>
<h3><b>Spot Reparenting</b></h3>
<p>Spot reparenting was developed by <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/036215377400400308?journalCode=taxa" target="_blank">Russell Osnes</a>. It focuses more on patients traumatized by specific experiences and incidents rather than by general disturbances in childhood.</p>
<h3><b>Self-Reparenting </b></h3>
<p>Unlike prior forms of reparenting, this form of reparenting by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breaking-Free-Self-Reparenting-New-Life/dp/0201046652" target="_blank">Muriel James</a> does not attempt to totally replace the parent ego state of the client. Instead, the therapy confirms the positive aspects already apparent in the client&#8217;s ego. The client is also the primary agent in therapy instead of the therapist.</p>
<h2><b>Self-Help Using Reparenting</b></h2>
<p>“For true reparenting treatment, you would want to seek out a mental health professional who was trained in the approach,” O’Neill said. “There are, however, some <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/7-self-care-tips-for-when-stress-affects-your-body/" target="_blank">self-help techniques</a> that could be useful to implement on your own.”</p>
<p>Here are a few ways to reparent yourself with self-help techniques that nurture your inner child:</p>
<ul>
<li>Affirmations that start with “I am…” For example, “I am a loving human.”</li>
<li>Talk to your Adult self and ask for help with grown up stuff.</li>
<li>Give yourself daily rewards.</li>
<li>Get at least 8 hours of sleep.</li>
<li>Read literature and inspiring quotes.</li>
<li>Write in your notebook a list of things to do on a daily basis.</li>
<li>Stay in the present by practicing mindfulness.</li>
<li>Think about good memories</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>How Do You Know if Reparenting Will Help You?</b></h2>
<p>It must be noted that though reparenting is used in psychological treatments, its use is in no way limited to those with clinically diagnosed disorders.</p>
<p>“If you feel that there are issues from your childhood that are impacting your current life, it could be a good invitation to seek out a mental health professional who can assess whether the approach could be beneficial for you,” Rachel O’Neill said.</p>
<p>You can ask your doctor for a recommendation, access the employee assistance program at your work, or check out Talkspace for professional online therapy. Many university clinics or nonprofits also offer free or affordable counseling.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe through reparenting you’ll find a trick or two for how to be a little kinder to yourself. Or maybe you’ll find that you understand the impact your childhood has had on your adult life, and you just needed someone to hear you say that out loud.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are several weeks into 2018 and this is as good as time as any to check in with yourself about your mental health goals. It can be difficult to begin and maintain progress through your goals, especially this time of year, as we all try to regain our footing with our day-to-day schedules and responsibilities.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s incredibly important to take some time to reflect and re-group to see where you are with your mental health resolutions. Taking time to assess your progress is an invaluable part of the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/12/getting-2018-smart-goals-mental-health-resolutions/" target="_blank">goal-setting process</a>. Moving forward takes routine, evaluation, and consistent checking in.</p>
<p>So, how are you doing with your goals? Here are a few questions that you may want to begin by asking yourself.</p>
<p><span id="more-8918"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>How have I been able to work towards my goals so far?</li>
<li>What has worked so far? What hasn’t? And what needs to be changed?</li>
<li>Looking at my mental health goals long-term, do they follow the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/12/getting-2018-smart-goals-mental-health-resolutions/">SMART model </a>or are there things that I need to change to make them more efficient?</li>
<li>For the progress that I’ve made (and will make), how can I reward myself or create intentional opportunities for positive reinforcement?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.livestrong.com/article/1007023-operant-conditioning-can-affect-adolescent-development/" target="_blank">Positive reinforcement </a>is, by far the best way that we can do to motivate and make new behavior stick. As a therapist, I find that too often my clients struggle with finding motivation to work towards their goals and keep the process moving. Often they’re self critical and get down when there are setbacks. What they often miss are opportunities for rewards or reinforcement that are well thought out and planned throughout their goal-achieving process.</p>
<p>When most of us set goals, especially ones related to mental health, we envision attaining the goal as THE reward. While this may or may not be true, it can be hard to maintain motivation and patience as you do the very challenging work of improving one’s mental health. Therefore, why not periodically set up some small rewards along the way that will help you feel good, even if you have slip ups or get discouraged?</p>
<p>For example, if you’re hoping to get better control of your anxiety and self-critical thoughts, that can be tough work! Perhaps part of your plan is to check in with your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/" target="_blank">online therapist </a>regularly or read a self-help book to help you achieve that goal. Everyday life can certainly be disruptive in reaching your goal, which means it&#8217;s going to take intense concentration and focus to get to the end goal of managing your thoughts differently.</p>
<p>Therefore, setting up some small treats for yourself along the way might be helpful in sustaining your motivation and energy. For instance, you might gift yourself a nice dinner out after attending therapy for a month or working through the first quarter of your self-help book. Halfway through your process, you might schedule a massage or take a mental health day from work (or both!) so that you get some extra rest and downtime. No matter what rewards you put into place, you will be practicing self-care along the way and working towards your goal of treating yourself better. It’s a win-win.</p>
<p>And let’s not forget that if your mental health resolution progress has already slowed, it’s OK. Many of us are in the same boat. The good news is that every moment presents a new opportunity to start anew. You don’t have to be held prisoner by missteps. It’s never too late to regroup and start again.</p>
<p>After all, you deserve it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a therapist who specializes in eating disorders and body image issues, I have worked with clients who begin therapy and — as they make progress — show signs of having an eating disorder. This doesn’t happen in an obvious way, though. To make the diagnosis, I analyze what they’re saying and look for subtle signs.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, I am going to share two different client scenarios below. Each of them may seem like a typical case of anxiety, mild depression and struggles with self-confidence and lack of happiness. With a closer look through the lens of an eating disorder therapist, these two stories take on different meanings.<span id="more-5267"></span></p>
<h2>Client Scenario 1: Depression and Anxiety with Subtle Signs of an Eating Disorder</h2>
<p>A client and therapist have been meeting for several sessions. The client’s initial reason for therapy was to deal with anxiety and depression that seem to come and go.</p>
<p>In the sessions, the client talks about how anxious she becomes when people invite her to a social event. In these discussions she also mentions the idea of eating in front of others is difficult. Her anxiety increases and she cannot focus on what is happening.</p>
<p>She loses her train of thought when talking or finds it difficult to engage in any meaningful conversation with others. After she departs from the social event, she is left feeling disconnected and depressed.</p>
<h2>Client Scenario 2: Confusing a ‘Lifestyle Change’ with Something Else</h2>
<p>Another client comes into therapy because she is struggling with feeling confident in herself. She says she needs to make a few changes that will help her feel more positive.</p>
<p>From the start she is talking about how she has tried many diets, but they don’t seem to work long-term. She feels good when she is working the diet. At some point, however, she blows the diet and is back to feeling like she will never be able to lose the weight and feel good.</p>
<p>She is currently trying a “lifestyle” change and is working with an online healthy living coach. She has lost some weight and is feeling good about this. During her sessions she reports to you how well she is doing with following her diet and how good this makes her feel.</p>
<p>She also shares that she has been to several social events. Each time she has brought her own food because the thought of not knowing what foods will be there makes her really anxious. If there are any “bad” foods being served, she couldn’t take the chance of ruining her day by eating these foods.</p>
<h2>Looking Past the Surface</h2>
<p>If you are not looking for eating disorder red flags, you would likely see the first client only as someone who is struggling with anxiety that can lead to feelings of depression. The second client could be seen as a woman who has been struggling with having confidence and simply did not find a diet that “worked.”</p>
<p>If you are looking through the lens of an eating disorder therapist, however, this anxiety/depression and struggle to find confidence and happiness looks much different.</p>
<p>The unspoken signs with the first client could sound like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>“My days are spent thinking about food, what foods I can eat, which foods are off limits.”</li>
<li>“If I eat that food I am going to feel like such a bad person.”</li>
<li>“I don’t deserve to eat anything.”</li>
<li>“When I am in a social event that involves food, I feel so overwhelmed, anxious and scared I can’t concentrate on anything except all the food thoughts and food rules that are going through my head.”</li>
</ul>
<p>With the second client the thoughts might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I hate my body”</li>
<li>“I will never be thin enough or pretty enough for anyone or good enough for anyone or anything.”</li>
<li>“I can’t eat any foods that are not on my food ‘rules’ list.</li>
<li>“If I do eat any bad foods, I am such a failure.”</li>
</ul>
<p>When you look at each client through the lens of an eating disorder therapist, the stories become different. Eating disorders are deceptive. It is easy to miss their unspoken signs.</p>
<p>Remember, these signs don’t guarantee the client has an eating disorder. They are, however, always worth discussing.</p>
<h2>Going Beyond the Stereotypes of an Eating Disorder</h2>
<p>Both of these clients could be of average, above average or somewhat below average weight for a person their size. Unless a client is severely under or overweight, a therapist cannot look at a client and determine from their size if they do or do not have an eating disorder. With the exception of the client deciding on their own that they need help with their eating disorder, it is going to take the skills of the therapist to discover and bring into discussion the unspoken signs.</p>
<p>We often think of people with eating disorders as having some sort of extreme weight or symptom such as binging or purging. People with eating disorders can look or act much different than that, though.</p>
<p>An eating disorder can be anything that includes “extreme emotions, attitudes and behaviors surrounding weight and food issues,” according to the National Eating Disorders Association <a href="http://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/general-information" target="_blank">[NEDA]</a>. If anything related to food, weight or body image prevents you from living a full and happy life, it is a mental health issue — maybe something a therapist can help you with.</p>
