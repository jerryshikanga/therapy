				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The title of this article is a lie. I don’t actually know how to survive. I don’t even know if I have.</p>
<p>As of this writing, my mom died less than three months ago. I found out she was sick on the first of April; she got her cancer diagnosis twenty days later. She lived for five weeks after that.</p>
<p>At one point — after diagnosis but before death — I sat in the bathtub after a long day keeping vigil by my mom’s bedside, noticing the chipped remnants of pink nail polish on my toes. When I had put that polish on, I didn’t even know she was sick.<span id="more-6912"></span></p>
<p>—</p>
<p>In some ways, my mom was old-New-England stoic. She used to be a runner; the family lore says she ran ten miles every day up until the day she had me. She had all three of her kids without epidurals, and she didn’t like to mention when she was sick or in pain. She just got up in the morning and kept moving forward, no matter how she felt.</p>
<p>That’s how she handled the first three months of her illness. She’d always had minor, recurring stomach issues like acid reflux; for a while she thought she had a very bad case of it. Then one morning she woke up and couldn’t keep anything down.</p>
<p>Sometimes it was nausea. Often it was a hard gag, a full-body gag. Noisy and horrifying. She used to send us out of the room when it started; she didn’t want us to see.</p>
<p>What was happening was that her tumor was obstructing her intestine. Nothing could get past. Her diagnosis was a long time coming, and my dad and I did plenty of second-guessing about the interim after she died.</p>
<p>But the truth was that once she started feeling it, the end was inevitable.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>My mom was a gourmet cook. Spicy tacos and rich Thai curries; fresh Vietnamese summer rolls and baked salmon rich as butter. Holiday feasts that were absolutely not to be missed. Pickles and dill beans that were the stuff of legend.</p>
<p>That was one of the things the tumor took, before it took her life. It wouldn’t let her eat.</p>
<p>At the hospital, they threaded a PICC line — a soft plastic tube — through her arm, up through a vein, and into the vicinity of her heart. Then they set up a machine that pumped liquid nutrition directly into her veins. The machine made a vaguely pleading, grinding noise as it did its work.</p>
<p>In this way we kept her from starving. But we also fed the tumor. It grew daily, bloating in her stomach, eating what she ate.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>The tumor made her susceptible to blood clots. There were large clots in her legs and one, an ominous shadow lurking in her lungs.</p>
<p>We knew the clots were there because the day she was supposed to get her first round of chemo, she lost her breath just walking into the living room. I went upstairs to find my shoes, and saw my dad’s car peeling out of the driveway from my bedroom window.</p>
<p>At the hospital, my mom seized up on a gurney. They put sieves in her veins to keep the clots in her legs from wandering, but there was nothing they could do about the one in her lungs. Her heart was straining so hard to beat against it that one of her ventricles was enlarged.</p>
<p>I sat in the hospital room with the news on mute. In some far-away world Donald Trump was also president and a broader apocalypse, beyond my private one, seemed very nigh. I didn’t care. I was numb from the outside in. I stared at the floor and thought <em>maybe it’s better if it just happens now</em>.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Before this happened, I couldn’t imagine telling a parent I was OK with their dying. I would stand stalwart in the face of reality and refuse to make my peace. In this way I believed I could anchor them to the world.</p>
<p>My dad and I spent a week sitting by her bedside, holding her arms down so she wouldn’t rip her PICC line out. She writhed and made sad little keening noises and asked for more painkillers with jaw-clenching composure.</p>
<p>When I knew there could be no recovery, I begged — quiet, in my head where nobody could hear — for the end. Like a trapped animal. I didn’t think about how it would be after, when I’d have to contend with myself. When I’d wonder why I didn’t stay strong and exhort her to fight, or whether it would have made a difference.</p>
<p>I didn’t think of the future at all. I could barely see beyond my next footstep.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Not long after my mom’s diagnosis, I spent an entire night weeping for her. Mourning her. Then I went into the hospital and saw her in her bed. She seemed so small and vulnerable. She held on to my hand so tight.</p>
<p>My mom was still alive. And she needed us to know it; to not put her in the grave before the tumor did. When my dad started to unravel about her death, I’d remind him — <em>she’s still alive. She needs us with her now. We don’t mourn the living in this house</em>.</p>
<p>Instead of anchoring my mom in this world, I anchored my dad in the present. We weren’t religious. We didn’t pray. We took one step, then we took another.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>At the end, my mom was in a twilight between rehabilitative care and hospice. People kept bringing up the option of caring for my mom at home. They would not shut up about it. I wished they would.</p>
<p>If my mom went home, it would mean my dad and I would be solely responsible for the job it now took an army of nurses to do. There would be a visiting hospice nurse once a week or so; and a hotline we could call at any time. “We’ll come out to help you whenever you need it,” the hospice lady reassured us.</p>
<p>I interpreted that to be roughly equivalent to when your spouse promises to “help with the housework.”</p>
<p>I didn’t want us to be the ones administering painkillers and turning her every two hours and cleaning her bedpan and giving her suppositories; keeping vigil all day and listening in the night for calamity. It was all I could do to sit by her bedside and be present while trained professionals did that.</p>
<p>My dad has an emergency response background and basic medical training — he looked this possibility right in the face and didn’t flinch. It was me who cracked.<br />
But it wasn’t the high-stakes meat-grinder of daily caretaking that scared me the most. It was taking death home with us and installing it where we slept. With my mom in hospice care, we could leave and come back. Taking her home meant no escape.</p>
<p>On a deeper level — and I couldn’t look straight at this until later — I couldn’t stand the thought of her dying in our childhood home. I didn’t want the terrible sounds of her dying to haunt that place, or to imagine my poor father alone at the end of this, trying to sleep in the room she died in.</p>
<p>How could I ever leave him there? How could I go back to my life? I wanted to be able to go back to my life.</p>
<p>When she was lucid, Mom wanted to stay in the hospice facility. <em>If she told us she wanted to go, I’d say yes</em>, I said to everyone. <em>Of course I’d say yes</em>. I think it was true.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>I compared notes with my sister and brother: it had happened at the worst possible time for all of us. My sister had just gotten a promotion; my brother, a new job. I’d just made some major changes to my life and thrown myself into a huge new project.</p>
<p>It felt wrong to care about anything other than her. But if we weren’t careful, we’d lose the lives we were building as a side effect of losing our mom. There was no one to prevent this but ourselves. I had also to think of my own health, my mental wellbeing. How to survive when a loved one does not.</p>
<p>People said <em>I’d be in my bed for months. I don’t know how you keep going</em>. Only those who hadn’t lost someone said this. My unspoken thought was: <em>you’ll find out</em>. Nobody gets a pass on loss.</p>
<p>You do what you do not because you’re strong, but because you have no choice.</p>
<p>__</p>
<p>I was both stronger and weaker than I thought. When my mom was being swallowed alive in her hospital bed — my whole life casually imploding in the background — the world shrank down from its broad horizons until all I could see was one foot in front of the other.</p>
<p>I lived through this moment, then the next one. I told myself <em>I will survive this</em>. I couldn’t save my mom. But I tried to save myself. I don’t know if that makes me a terrible person. I don’t care. I’m still here.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to survive a loved one’s death. There are no maps here. You can only keep going.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is possible to experience childhood adversity and still feel good as an adult. In my most recent study of 310 successful men and women — featured in my latest book, </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Adversity-Advantage-Childhood-Hardship-Success/dp/1939548675/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Adversity Advantage</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — 40% experienced child abuse, witnessed </span><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/5-celebrity-women-spoke-domestic-violence/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">domestic violence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or had an alcoholic/substance abusing parent struggling with </span><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/addiction/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">addiction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you broaden the definition to include poverty, death of a family member, divorce, or mental illness, 60% experienced serious childhood adversity. In spite of these impactful childhood problems, this group of successful people reported a high level of life satisfaction as adults, much higher than the average in the population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many reported that things did not come easily for them, however. They grew up with poor role models for communication, conflict negotiation, self-esteem, forming relationships, and expression of anger. The abuse they experienced created many personal and work problems. Turning their adversity into successes required them to become students of factors that lead to success. </span></p>
<p><span id="more-6087"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My research demonstrates the following skills as critical for overall well-being and to achieve success at work:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conflict negotiation </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building authentic relationships</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthy boundaries</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">High work engagement</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flexible work style</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confidence to socially influence others</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Networking skills</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeking and accepting challenging projects and positions</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transforming their childhood hardship — whether that was family alcoholism, abuse, poverty, or poor </span><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/mental-health-stories/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mental health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — into survival skills was required. One business owner who grew up in an abusive family said, “After the way I was treated by my family, I was determined to never treat anyone in that way in my own life.” A healthcare executive said, “See your adversity in perspective and relate your current strengths to early adverse situations you chose to overcome.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the people I studied recommended the following to recover from their childhood troubles:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identify your values and how you want to be treated and treat others.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acknowledge the severity of your childhood problems.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand the impact family problems had on your confidence, self-esteem, and relationships.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surround yourself with people who treat you with respect. Do not recreate the abusive relationships you had as a child in your adult life. Ask yourself, “How do I feel when I am around this person?”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Become a student of good communication and forming relationships with both sexes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose work or a career that provides meaning and fits with your personality.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build authentic social capital through networking and mentorships.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop a spiritual practice.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recovering from childhood adversity is not easy. The impact of being a small child with parents who raged, abused, or neglected you leaves an indelible footprint that can make the rest of your life more difficult. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, I have seen many of these people recover and thrive in their personal and work lives. While it is not the purpose of the workplace to help survivors recover, work can be helpful. Having an overarching purpose and meaningful work in life provides a tree from which you can hang other “ornaments” that lead to recovery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I recommend the following specific skills to integrate and move past your childhood hardships:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discover meaning in your life</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know your values</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop your spirituality</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop mindfulness toward your feelings</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actively choose positive thoughts to replace negative ones</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn to communicate assertively to protect your boundaries and ask for what you need and want</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop a healthy network of friends and family</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn how to comfortably negotiate conflict </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know what makes you happy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find a good job fit</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many resources that can be helpful in the recovery process. You may want to seek the help of a workplace employee assistance program, a </span><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/mental-health-counselor/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mental health counselor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> experienced in the area of trauma recovery, support groups such as Alanon or Adult Children of Alcoholics, or attend The Meadows Survivor workshops. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the sad ironies of life is that as we age, often we are still who we were 10 or 20 years ago. Superficially things may have changed, but certain situations and people may elicit feelings and thoughts we had as a child. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, peace and happiness are attainable by taking the time and energy to do some honest self-exploration of those early childhood years. If you want a guide during this exploration, consider working with a licensed therapist.</span></p>
