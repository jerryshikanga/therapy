				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the darker times in my life came after the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/06/coping-with-grief-and-anxiety-in-the-wake-of-the-orlando-shooting/" target="_blank">mass shooting at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub</a>. It was the end of Albuquerque’s Pride weekend, a celebration of togetherness and community, but I quickly found myself feeling more isolated than ever. In times of tragedy, healthy people lean on others for support. I didn’t do that.</p>
<p>After a year of shutting out everybody who tried to care about me, I had nobody left to talk to. My best friend was in another city and my parents were in another state. All my friends were seeking solace with their families, their close friends, and their lovers, while I was attempting to drown out the collective sobs of my LGBTQ brothers and sisters with my one true love — work.</p>
<p>But misery doesn’t just love company, it needs it to heal. After a couple days of denial, I fell apart. All I wanted was a hug. I chose to seek comfort in people I thought were sure to know exactly how I felt: other gay men. Not quite finished with my poor life choices, I chose to connect with them on Grindr. I can say with great confidence that one-night flings with strangers will do nothing to fix loneliness.<span id="more-6876"></span></p>
<h2>Making Progress</h2>
<p>After the experience, I chose to abandon my independent, icy facade, and began connecting with my friends on a deeper level. I told them about what I’d been through during my abusive relationship. I told them I was <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/bipolar-disorder/" target="_blank">bipolar</a> and, for the first time in my life, admitted out loud that I was scared of what that meant for my life. I asked them for hugs, opinions, kind words, and inclusion. It paid off and I soon felt as loved and cared for as I ever had. I felt like I had a team who would go to bat for me. I felt like I belonged.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes to how much I needed to be around people who loved me. About a month later, I moved in order to live with my best friend. Six months after that, I met a man who would soon become my boyfriend. We’ve since moved in together, adopted a kitten, set joint goals, and even talked about kids and marriage someday. My life looks dramatically different than it did one year ago. I’ve learned to open up and show my vulnerability. I’ve even sobbed my eyes out while watching <em>Steel Magnolias</em> in front of him without feeling judged. I feel loved, supported, and connected.</p>
<p>I still talk to my best friend almost every day and I never go more than a week without talking to my parents. I’m now working as part of a team of more than 40 people and get to interact with my co-workers constantly.</p>
<p>But sometimes I still fall apart.</p>
<h2>The Sting of Abandonment</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/abusive-relationships-made-perfectionist/" target="_blank">first article I wrote for Talkspace</a> was about adjusting to the idea of being in a healthy relationship when all you’ve known is abuse and pain. It’s a scary concept to let someone in. It’s even scarier when you start to expect a certain standard of behavior. He’s always been open, honest, and upfront about his feelings. One afternoon, however, he let me down, and I forgot how to act in response.</p>
<p>Since meeting, we’ve had two arguments. One was fueled by a lack of sleep, starvation, a touch of heat stroke, and a nicotine craving, so we’ll focus on the other. This one involved hours of seething silence, uncontrollable sobbing, and an evacuation plan. He’d failed to explain a boundary to me, so when I crossed it, he snapped at me. I misinterpreted the situation. Rather than asking for clarification, I got angry, passive-aggressive, and silent. I don’t know about you, but I know what silent rage does to me and my thoughts.</p>
<p>I felt alone again, but this time feeling like I belonged to a group couldn’t fix it. I didn’t need my best friend, my co-workers, or my family. I only wanted to feel like my partner loved me.</p>
<p>Faith Hill talked about it in “Cry.” Cassadee Pope touched on it in “I Wish I Could Break Your Heart.” I craved a sign that told me he took me seriously. He didn’t show that sign. He was aggressively “fine” while I boiled over. It’s easy to feel abandoned by your partner when he or she chooses to put on a brave, stoic face while you lose your mind.</p>
<p>We got a moment alone and I immediately lashed out. I told him I was hurt, that I’d felt slighted and mistreated. When he shut down my attempt at a conversation, it felt like we were hopeless and trapped in a situation with no resolution. I was angry, and it seemed like he didn’t even care enough about me to be angry in return. A couple of hours later, when he tried to strike up a conversation about dinner, I snapped and begged him to “go be fine somewhere else.”</p>
<p>Eventually, I ended up crying on his shoulder and word-vomiting all the bad feelings I’d had that day. He explained his side with patience and fairness. That was enough to help me feel better. Still, it scares me that I can so easily slip back into the dark emotional spaces I thought I’d clawed out of. I know he loves me, and I’m mortified by how easy it was to convince myself otherwise.</p>
<h2>Potential</h2>
<p>I wish I could say that I’ve overcome my feelings of loneliness, my fear of abandonment, and all my other issues. In particular, I wish I could claim I’ve battled the demons on my own and learned to keep them at bay with positive self-reflection. But I haven’t. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">Therapy</a> has helped, but sometimes I still doubt I ever will.</p>
<p>I still assume the worst when it comes to conflict. I still begin mentally preparing to pack my bags when voices get louder and faces turn red. I don’t know if that will ever change or if I’ll ever stop escalating to hysterics in a heartbeat when my heart starts breaking. If you’re in my boat, I hope you’ll take comfort in knowing at least that I’m right there with you.</p>
<p>What I do know: I am more willing to open up about my feelings to the people around me. All the people in my life have proved I can trust them to be responsible, kind, and patient. They have shown that they take me and my suffering seriously, as seriously as my <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-its-like-to-use-talkspace-text-therapy-app-2015-3" target="_blank">therapist</a>. Most importantly, they’ve shown that they’ll stick around, even when things get rough.</p>
<p>Someday, I hope that I’ll be able to remember this even during the worst of times. Until then, I’ll rely on the moments of reassurance that come after the storm. It’s beautiful to give thanks for the people who show and prove their love.</p>
<p>As my boyfriend likes to say, life would be boring if we were always happy. Without loneliness, we wouldn’t know how it feels to belong and be at peace.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Yes, loneliness can impact your lifespan.</h2>
<p>The truth is, if you haven&#8217;t experienced loneliness for yourself, no matter how much you read, talk, or hear about it, you may never fully understand what it&#8217;s like. It&#8217;s more than just a longing for authentic and meaningful connections with others, loneliness is a state that impacts the overall emotional, mental, and physical wellbeing of a person.<span id="more-741"></span></p>
<p>When someone feels significant emotional isolation, their mortality risk is as high as it is in people who smoke &#8211; which in either case is much higher than in the average person with few or no bad habits. Furthermore, loneliness greatly increases a person&#8217;s susceptibility to various medical conditions such as heart disease or different types of cancer. This makes loneliness not only a <a title="The Sad Truth About Loneliness in a Connected World" href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/05/the-sad-truth-about-loneliness-in-a-connected-world/" target="_blank">social problem</a>, but also a health related one.</p>
<p>According to our friends at the <a title="Nursing School Hub " href="http://www.nursingschoolhub.com/loneliness/" target="_blank">Nursing School Hub</a>, &#8220;those who reported being lonely had a 14% greater risk of dying.&#8221; Understanding this, and acting on it is the first step we can take to alleviate this widespread problem. For example, therapy can be a great resource for lonely people as it provides them with the skills they need to be more social.</p>
<p>The infographic below offers an excellent breakdown of who is most affected by loneliness and why &#8211; the findings may surprise you. And we hope, because sharing is caring, you will share this information with everyone you know.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>“What should young people do with their lives today? Many things, obviously. But the most daring thing is to create stable communities in which the terrible disease of loneliness can be cured.” – Kurt Vonnegut</h2>
<p>Imagine the following scenario: You are sitting in a restaurant with your best friend. It&#8217;s been a long time since you&#8217;ve seen each other and you have been looking forward to reconnecting. Instead of doing exactly that, you are both on Facebook, liking and sharing posts that have nothing to do with what’s happening between you right then and there. When you leave dinner, you realize that you still miss your friend, but you’re not sure why. Furthermore, it dawns on you that recently, you’ve been feeling a bit disconnected from all of your friends, and it makes you terribly sad.<span id="more-423"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;All the lonely people, where do they all come from?&#8221; &#8211; The Beatles <a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=“All the lonely people, where do they all come from?” http://bit.ly/1JXbCvc via @talkspace"> [tweet this] </a></p></blockquote>
<p>There’s a reason you&#8217;d feel that way, and it’s way more common than you can imagine. Turns out, our use of the world’s most popular <a title="Facebook Use Predicts Declines in Subjective Well-Being in Young Adults" href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0069841#s2" target="_blank">social network</a> may have something to do with it. Although Facebook is an invaluable tool for connecting with each other, the way most of us tend to interact with it makes us prone to feelings of depression, envy, anxiety, and &#8211; you guessed it &#8211; loneliness. What makes this particularly unpleasant is that numerous studies have found that persisting loneliness negatively impacts our physical and mental health. And to top all of that off, it&#8217;s also been shown to decrease our <a title="Social isolation, loneliness, and all-cause mortality in older men and women" href="http://www.pnas.org/content/110/15/5797.abstract" target="_blank">overall mortality</a>. Clearly that&#8217;s not great.</p>
<p>Writing for <a title="The Atlantic " href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/is-facebook-making-us-lonely/308930/" target="_blank"><em>The Atlantic</em></a>, Stephen Marche makes the following observation: “We have never been more detached from one another, or lonelier. In a world consumed by ever more novel modes of socializing, we have less and less actual society. We live in an accelerating contradiction: the more connected we become, the lonelier we are. We were promised a global village; instead we inhabit the drab cul-de-sacs and endless freeways of a vast suburb of information.” We have succeeded in creating stable digital communities, but not so much at curing loneliness.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Innovation of Loneliness</em></strong> draws on some interesting sociological research to bring us a comprehensive understanding of how Facebook is contributing to our overwhelmingly pervasive loneliness problem. Created by <a title="Shimi Cohen" href="http://www.shimicohen.com/">Shimi Cohen</a>, the video makes a smart, though painfully obvious argument for why we should try to connect in real life, rather than our virtual ones, and it is absolutely on point. As a matter of fact, it becomes especially poignant when it touches on our ability to edit our social profiles, clearly illustrating how we spend entirely too much time on self-promotion and crafting ideal images of ourselves.</p>
<p>Check it out below.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c6Bkr_udado" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Considering that the number of people reporting feeling lonely doubled in the last 30 years, it’s hard not to see a correlation between loneliness and the rise of social networks. Notably, the density of these reports is escalating in recent years. The problem with controlling how others see us is that we rarely get to be seen as we really are, unfiltered. <em>To be or not to be</em> <em>ourselves</em>, is one the bigger paradoxes of our time. And if we somehow manage to let go of our need to control our public image, we may be able to combat our increasing loneliness.</p>
