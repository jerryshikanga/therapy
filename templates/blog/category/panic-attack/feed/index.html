<hr />
<p><a class="recomendedHyperlink" href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/5-ways-to-curb-your-work-related-anxiety" target="_blank">Anxiety</a> disorders are the most common mental illness in the United States, affecting 40 million adults ages 18 and older every year — that&#8217;s 18.1 percent of the population. Anxiety develops from a complex set of risk factors, including genetics, brain chemistry, <a class="recomendedHyperlink" href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/18-free-personality-tests-that-are-actually-fun" target="_blank">personality</a> and life events, and people with anxiety disorders are three to five times more likely to go to the doctor and six times more likely to be hospitalized for psychiatric disorders than those who do not suffer. But only 36.9 percent of those who deal with it receive treatment and, even for those who do, dealing with their anxiety is no easy feat. For couples, anxiety disorders can cause conflicts if they don&#8217;t communicate well.</p>
<p><span id="more-9946"></span></p>
<p>People with anxiety disorders may deal with panic attacks. A panic attack is &#8220;a sudden episode of intense fear that triggers severe physical reactions when there is no real danger or apparent cause,&#8221; <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/panic-attacks/symptoms-causes/syc-20376021" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">according to Mayo Clinic</a>. Panic attacks can be frightening, particularly if the person suffering one feels as though they&#8217;re losing control, having a heart attack or even dying. And the worst part is that panic attacks typically happen without warning — while driving, working, sleeping. They&#8217;re indiscriminate and can happen to anyone, even if they don&#8217;t have a history of attacks.</p>
<p><a class="recomendedHyperlink" href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/master-these-communication-skills-to-kill-it-in-your-career" target="_blank">Communication</a> is key in any relationship, and especially so for those who deal with anxiety disorders. They know the importance of having partners who understand them and how to communicate with them, especially during <a class="recomendedHyperlink" href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/anxiety-attacks-at-work" target="_blank">anxiety attacks</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Kelsey Darragh, a producer in Los Angeles who suffers for anxiety, tweeted a now-viral list she&#8217;d written for her boyfriend about how to help her manage her anxiety. The aptly titled list, “<a href="https://twitter.com/kelseydarragh/status/995045375420567552?tfw_site=goodhealth&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.health.com%2Fanxiety%2Fviral-tweet-about-how-to-help-someone-during-panic-attack" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">15 Realistic Things You Can Do to Help Me Through a Panic Attack</a>,” explains how Darragh feels during an anxiety attack, and it dives into what her boyfriend can do to support her. Her tweet reads: &#8220;I have panic &amp; anxiety disorder. My boyfriend does not&#8230; but wants to understand it so he can help me. SO I made him this list! Feel free to share w ur loved ones that need guidance!&#8221; The tweet has garned almost 25K likes to date, more than 8.5K retweets and countless comments.</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/fairygodboss/image/upload/v1526937644/production/tinymceImages/927eddcc07a5f296515e6bd06f699105e0c15787.jpg" alt="" width="554" height="572" /></p>
<p><em>Source: <a class="companyLink" href="https://fairygodboss.com/company-overview/twitter" target="_blank">Twitter</a></em></p>
<p>“Know that I am scared and won’t be able to explain why, so please don’t freak out or be annoyed [with] me,” she wrote at the top of her list. She also instructed him to find her medicine if it&#8217;s nearby, to practice breathing exercises with her, to distract her panic with gentle suggestions of things they could do together, to remind her that it&#8217;ll pass, to bring her water if she wants it, to take her home if possible, to help her breathe, to call her mom/sister/friend if necessary, to tell her not to fight it, to empathize with her and to communicate with her about how they handled the situation together after it inevitably passes.</p>
<p>She also offered clear explanations as to how she may react to the aforementioned help — like she will feel frustrated by breathing exercises and she might feel like she has to vomit if she drinks too much water.</p>
<p>“Once it passes (like hours later), open up a dialogue with me about it,” she wrote as item No. 15. “How’d you do? What can we do next time?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s incredibly important for a partner to be able to listen and, more importantly, understand their partner&#8217;s anxiety. And Darragh&#8217;s tweet resonates well with a lot of people in her position.</p>

Talkspace shares stories of how therapy helps people of all backgrounds work through the daily challenges of modern life.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>The panic attacks escalated during my senior year of college.</p>
<p>Once, I was sitting on the side of the freeway. I abandoned my car a mile back and called 911, convinced I was having a heart attack. Confused, I gave the 911 operator the wrong location of where I was. The longer I waited for help the more I struggled to breathe.</p>
<p><span id="more-9877"></span></p>
<p>Another time, while stopped at a traffic light inside the city streets, I got out of my car and started walking. Vehicles raced past me while others honked their horns and cursed me for obstructing traffic. I left my car in the middle of the busy street and walked home. When I arrived I broke down and cried.</p>
<p>They were difficult to predict, but sometimes I felt a panic attack coming on. At home alone, I was suddenly afraid something horrible was going to happen to me. I had it set in my head that I needed get out of the house or I would die. I took off out the door and wandered the city streets. It was midday in Phoenix, and the 114 degree August heat blistered my bare feet. I had no water, no phone, and no idea where I was going.</p>
<p>I was a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/therapist-helped-become-best-single-mom/" target="_blank">single mother</a> working to support my family while attending school full time. I was in the home stretch. Though my education should have created a sense of hope for the future of myself and my children, the pressures of so many obligations suddenly began to break me. I was panicking.</p>
<h2>Seeking Help for my Panic Attacks</h2>
<p>As the panic attacks began to occur more often, I was forced to acknowledge the unsafe situations I was putting myself in. I also suffer from <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/know-kind-bipolar/" target="_blank">Bipolar Disorder II</a>, which often plays with my mind, even more so because I am high functioning. There’s a place in between the waves of depression and manic crash where I believe I have a firm grasp on the illness, but that grasp often proves an illusion.I knew I needed help, but this would prove challenging with my hectic schedule. The college provided free counseling on campus and I decided to give it a try. I wasn’t sure what to expect.</p>
<p><i>Will the counselor and I develop a treatment plan? Will we have regularly scheduled appointments or is it a one time thing? What are the counselor’s credentials? </i>These were the questions I asked the receptionist when scheduling an appointment.</p>
<p>“He can meet with you right now,” she said and handed me a questionnaire to fill out.</p>
<p>I felt uncomfortable during my first session with Thomas, it was a new experience. I explained the recurring panic attacks, and there was little dialogue between us as he formulated a plan for me. He handed me a sheet of paper, referring to it as a “homework assignment,” and set up an appointment time for the following week.</p>
<p>The worksheet was a diagram. At the top was a box that read: “Panic Attack.” I was to fill in the empty boxes below with the feelings I experience leading up to my panic attacks.</p>
<p>During our next appointment, he guided me through the physiology of fight or flight response and we worked on breathing exercises.</p>
<p>Our next few visits focused on these exercises and coping tools I would use if the panic attacks continued.</p>
<h2>Understanding Panic in the Moment</h2>
<p>I was in the grocery store when I began to feel yet another attack come on. Standing alone in the aisle I stopped in my tracks and did a breathing exercise. It helped. I felt calmer and proceeded to the next aisle. I turned the corner and saw a cluster of people.</p>
<p>My vision tunneled, my heart raced and my fingertips went numb. I freaked out and dropped the basket full of groceries I was carrying. I watched the items hit the floor and explode, causing everyone to look up at me. My pulse pounded in my ears and my hairline dripped with sweat.</p>
<p>I ran from the store.</p>
<p>The next time I saw Thomas I expressed my frustration. We were on our sixth visit, but I was still having panic attacks. We hadn’t even begun to work toward the discovery of <i>why</i> I panic. But I still felt hopeless.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to figure out why you panic,” he said. “You need to learn how to deal with it.”</p>
<p>“I’m not safe when I have a panic attack.”</p>
<p>“You put yourself in unsafe situations trying to stop yourself from panicking. What would happen to you if you just allowed yourself to panic?”</p>
<p>We fell silent while I contemplated his question.</p>
<p>“Nothing would happen. I’d just have a panic attack and then it would be over.”</p>
<h2>What I Learned From My Therapist</h2>
<p>Thomas helped me realize that I was causing myself more panic by not allowing myself to accept what was happening to me in the moment. Panic attacks aren’t necessarily bad or harmful. It’s a physical defense to an emotional reaction.</p>
<p>I still struggle with anxiety as a symptom of depression, but <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_POST_INLINE&amp;utr_adgroup=therapy-helped-me-stop-my-panic-attacks?utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/therapy-helped-me-stop-my-panic-attacks/" target="_blank">thanks to my experience in therapy</a>, I am thankful to say I haven’t experienced another panic attack.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve had severe <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/anxiety-attack-vs-panic-attack-one/" target="_blank">panic attacks</a> on and off since I was 16 years old. Although I may never be able to pinpoint their exact cause, I’ve long suspected that some of the traumas I experienced as a child (divorce, abandonment, custody battles, and verbal abuse) contributed to my panic disorder.</p>
<p>Recently, though, my <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a> mentioned something in passing that illuminated the whole phenomenon for me in an entirely different way. She said that when we hold our emotions inside, they tend to kind of morph into conditions like anxiety and panic.</p>
<p>A lightbulb went off in my brain then: I could picture myself, a young girl, witnessing and experiencing all sort of things that I now know were most certainly traumatic, and basically just standing there absorbing them all. I was always the “good girl,” whom everyone thought was so resilient despite all the difficult things that were unfolding.<span id="more-8358"></span></p>
<p>I learned to tightly and deliberately hold my emotions inside — partly so that I could please the adults around me, but also so I could protect myself from feeling how enormously hurt and shamed I was by some of the things I was experiencing.</p>
<p>But what became of all those feelings that I stuffed inside? They certainly did not go away, and I was rarely given space to just feel them all, without judgment or shame. Could they have shown themselves in other ways — perhaps expressed as panic?</p>
<h2>Fleshing Out the Theory of Childhood Trauma Contributing to Panic Disorder</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/03/meet-our-therapists-a-series-nicole-amesbury/" target="_blank">Nicole Amesbury</a>, a licensed mental health counselor (LMHC), psychotherapist, and Head of Clinical Development at Talkspace, tells me that my theory about the relationship between childhood traumas and panic disorder makes absolute sense.</p>
<p>“It has been well established that traumatic events may trigger <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/different-types-anxiety-disorders-classified/" target="_blank">anxiety disorders</a>, especially in someone who is susceptible because of additional biological or social factors,” she said.</p>
<p>Pretty much everyone in my family has some sort of anxiety disorder, so it stands to reason that I would have a propensity toward the condition in a general sense. But, for me, panic attacks have been the hallmark trait of my anxiety disorder. I can have periods of low-level anxiety — sometimes for months or years — and then be triggered by something and end up with several months of severe, debilitating panic attacks, often followed up by newfound phobias (my phobias get recycled every few years, based on what my latest bouts of panic attack involved).</p>
<p>So, again, why does my anxiety disorder show up in this particular way? And could it have something to do with the precise way I processed my emotional experiences from my earliest years?</p>
<p>Yes, says Amesbury. “As children, we are vulnerable and we are just learning what the world is about,” Amesbury tells me. She explains that specific phobias (like fear of spiders, for example) are quite common in childhood, and can begin as a result of one traumatic exposure. Likewise, if a child experiences a more global trauma (for example, a threat to the integrity of their family, as was the case in my experience), it is quite possible and understandable that they would develop a full-blown panic disorder.</p>
<p>But it’s not just the events that children experience that make them more vulnerable to this disorder, Amesbury explains: it’s how they are or aren’t helped through them, and how they are taught to process and make sense of them.</p>
<p>“The more confusing and complex the experience(s) are, the more difficult it can be for the child (and then adult) to feel secure and safe, especially, if a caregiver was not able to help the child after the experience,” Amesbury explains. “Young children do not know and cannot find the words to express what they do not understand and so these mysterious experiences in childhood can represent just that, a memory of the fearful unknown.”</p>
<p>This insight resonated with me deeply — and probably does with many people who have experienced childhood traumas. I did not have the language or the understanding to make sense of what was happening around me. My parents, though they tried to help in certain ways, were often quite absorbed in what was happening to themselves. Not only that, they simply were not equipped to help me process the events that were unfolding.</p>
<p>So what happens when these emotions are held inside — repressed, unexplored, and uncared for? Simply put: they don’t go away. They lie in wait, Amesbury explains, and once triggered, can manifest as an anxiety attack or panic attack.</p>
<p>Amesbury used the metaphor of a message in a bottle to illustrate how this works. “Imagine someone ship-wrecked and lost,” she says. “They write a SOS message in a bottle that gets thrown out to sea and it is just floating, waiting for someone to find it, read the message and then offer help. The message in the bottle is like the old memory that triggers anxiety.”</p>
<p>I love a good visual like that. For me, I see my body as the bottle, and the messages as emotions that have built so much pressure inside me over the years that when the message is found and read, the bottle just basically bursts — all the emotions spilling out through the shattered glass. This is how intense panic attacks feel for me.</p>
<h2>How to Treat Panic Disorder Related to Childhood Trauma</h2>
<p>The good news? (I promise there is some!). Amesbury says that once you are able to understand the “messages” that you have bottled up you can “find your way and navigate the waters more easily and confidently.”</p>
<p>In other words, anxiety disorder (including panic disorder) are relatively easy to treat, says Amesbury. She doesn’t recommend one type of treatment in particular. Sometimes panic disorder and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/ptsd/" target="_blank">PTSD</a> are brought on by one particular trigger, but sometimes they happen spontaneously and it becomes difficult to trace the exact cause.</p>
<p>That is why Amesbury recommends anyone suffering from an anxiety disorder seek professional treatment. “Being assessed and <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_BOTTOM&amp;utr_adgroup=bottom-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=8358" target="_blank">seeking help with a licensed professional</a> is important,” Amesbury explains, noting that treatment plans vary, and depend on “each person’s history and a variety of other factors.”</p>
<p>I know that for me, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a> has been enormously helpful over the years as I have worked through my panic disorder. I have successfully used methods from <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-how-is-it-conducted-online/" target="_blank">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</a> to combat my panic attacks directly, as they are happening. But one of the most important things I have learned over the years is the power of speaking my truths and telling my story — both in therapy, and out.</p>
<p>Probably the worst thing I can do as someone with a panic disorder is to keep my emotions inside — and it’s something I have had to learn over and over throughout my life, unfortunately. Holding your feelings inside is something that is very hard to change, especially when you have been doing so all your life.</p>
<p>But I’m working on it. And I am so grateful to have found therapists and compassionate people in my life who “hold the space” for my feelings, and allow me to express them safely, and without judgment or fear.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Classifying different types of anxiety attacks can be difficult. “Anxiety attack” is not an official clinical term. You won’t find it in the “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,” the handbook most mental health professionals reference. There is also the issue of both mental health clients and professionals confusing anxiety attacks and panic attacks.</p>
<p>“Anxiety attack” is a colloquial term clients created to describe intense or extended periods of anxiety. On a scale of intensity, an anxiety attack is between mild feelings of anxiety and a panic attack. Because of its frequency, many mental health professionals adopted it. To learn more about what an anxiety attack is and dispel any confusion, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/anxiety-attack-vs-panic-attack-one/" target="_blank">read our piece on anxiety attacks vs. panic attacks</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike repeated panic attacks, anxiety attacks are not necessarily a sign of a mental health condition. If you are experiencing a lot of stress or going through a rough patch in life, it’s natural to have intense anxiety that occurs frequently. Experiencing many anxiety attacks without an apparent cause, however, can be a sign of an anxiety disorder.</p>
<p>Despite it not being an official clinical term, there are types of anxiety attacks. Many therapists recognize they are legitimate mental health issues. We decided to classify them based on the factors that determine how people experience an anxiety attack.<span id="more-5764"></span></p>
<h2>The 5 Factors in Different Types of Anxiety Attacks</h2>
<p>Here are the five factors that distinguish different types of anxiety attacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Causes: Thoughts vs. Situations</li>
<li>Expected vs. Unexpected</li>
<li>Physiological Symptoms</li>
<li>Duration/Frequency</li>
<li>Intensity</li>
</ol>
<h2>Causes: Thoughts vs. Situations</h2>
<p>Both thoughts and situations cause anxiety attacks. The experience is different, however.</p>
<p>The causes tend to point to different issues as well. Thought-based anxiety attacks can be signs of generalized anxiety disorder. Situation-based anxiety attacks might can be symptoms of social phobias or social anxiety disorder.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>Some anxiety attacks happen regardless of immediate external stimuli. These usually start with chains of anxious thoughts that build in momentum until they cause physiological symptoms. The thoughts are often part of apprehension about the future.</p>
<p>Below are some examples of these thought patterns. <a href="http://www.beautifulmindtherapy.com/" target="_blank">Therapist Asta Klimaite</a> documented common anxious thoughts her clients had. Below are the most common:</p>
<ul>
<li>People know I have anxiety and they judge me.</li>
<li>I am sick with a terminal illness and my doctor just didn’t diagnose me correctly. I am going to die soon.</li>
<li>I am going to be fired. If I will be fired, I won’t be able to support my family and we will be homeless. If we are homeless, I will be a bad parent/partner/daughter/child. If I am a bad person, I am a failure.</li>
<li>I will get into a car accident and my insurance premium will go up. I am going to look like an idiot or I am going to kill myself in this car accident.</li>
<li>I am a bad parent and everyone knows it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Situations</strong></p>
<p>These feelings of anxiety stem from specific situations rather than general concerns about life or health. Let’s say you have a public speech coming up. You might have anxious thoughts like: “I’m going to make a bad speech. I’m going to get nervous. People are going to notice how nervous I am.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nashvilleconciergecounseling.com/" target="_blank">Therapist Ginger Poag</a> offered the example of her clients worrying about a family reunion during Christmas or Thanksgiving. They worry about who is going to be there and who is going to say what. Repeatedly imagining how everything could go wrong builds a sense of dread.</p>
<p>These types of thoughts can snowball until anxiety is out of control. You might eventually come to expect these situations to induce anxiety attacks. This can create meta anxiety: anxiety about the possibility of experiencing anxiety, especially during certain situations. Anxiety can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<h2>Expected vs. Unexpected</h2>
<p>Whether people expect an anxiety attack can shape how they process it. When anxiety attacks happen unexpectedly, they might be more frightening and difficult to cope with. Expecting the attack may cause a feeling of dread, but it can also make the coping process easier.</p>
<p><strong>Expected</strong></p>
<p>If you have an anxiety attack as part of a general pattern, you will most likely have a great deal of expectations around the attack before it happens. It might creep up as the anxious thoughts build upon each other — the aforementioned meta anxiety.</p>
<p>These expected anxieties are often situational. If you’re dreading a situation, you will start to feel anxious about it before and during the events.</p>
<p>An anxiety attack can also be about a general worry you have. It could be something you have ruminated upon so many times you now recognize it as a source of anxiety, something you expect to cause an anxiety attack.</p>
<p><strong>Unexpected</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes anxiety attacks happen without a clear source. When you don’t know what is causing them, they are almost impossible to predict. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/drgabbyfarkas" target="_blank">psychiatrist Gabby Farkas</a>, unexpected anxiety attacks are often a sign of an anxiety disorder, including generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder.</p>
<h2>Physiological Symptoms</h2>
<p>Here are some common <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders/index.shtml#part_145336" target="_blank">symptoms of anxiety</a> and anxiety attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restlessness, feeling wound-up or on edge</li>
<li>Being easily fatigued</li>
<li>Difficulty concentrating or having your mind go blank</li>
<li>Irritability</li>
<li>Muscle tension</li>
<li>Difficulty controlling worries</li>
<li>Sleep problems (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying sleep)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you study these symptoms, you might discover which thoughts or situations trigger them. Maybe worries about your health make you irritable while anxieties regarding your career keep you up at night. Presentations or tests might make you feel restless while anxiety about dating causes fatigue. Learning the correlations can inform treatment and help you cope.</p>

<h2>Duration/Frequency</h2>
<p>Anxiety attacks can last anywhere from minutes to hours, days, even weeks. They can also occur with varying frequencies. People can have several in one day or only one every couple of months.</p>
<p>Both duration and frequency depend on the causes of the anxiety attacks. For example, someone with an anxiety disorder might experience daily anxiety attacks that last at least an hour. On the other hand, someone who doesn’t have an anxiety disorder will most likely have attacks that are brief (maybe only 10 minutes) and less frequent.</p>
<p>Stress is a factor as well. Even if someone doesn’t have a diagnosable anxiety disorder, they may experience frequent and long anxiety attacks when there are extreme levels of stress in their life.</p>
<h2>Intensity</h2>
<p>There are a few ways to measure the intensity of an anxiety attack. One is by looking at the number of symptoms that occur. Experiencing the combination of shortness of breath, muscle tension, and insomnia is obviously more intense than only experiencing one symptom.</p>
<p>Another measure is how debilitating the attack is. If the attack is so intense that it includes symptoms such as choking and a feeling of dying or having a heart attack, it might not be an anxiety attack, but a panic attack.</p>
<h2>Understanding Yourself and the Different Types of Anxiety Attacks</h2>
<p>Our minds are like oceans of causes and effects. Each memory, thought and emotion connects to one another and sends ripples through our bodies. When we experience anxiety attacks, these ripples become waves that disrupt our lives. By picking apart the factors that create them, you can find the sources of anxiety and identify the types of anxiety attacks you experience. Understanding more about anxiety will bring you one step closer to reducing it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Knowing the difference between an anxiety attack vs. panic attack is more than an issue of semantics. It can shape the course of your mental health. If you don’t know which one you are having, it will be difficult to find the appropriate treatment or develop useful coping skills. You might waste time addressing the wrong issues.</p>
<p>By understanding the issue of anxiety attacks vs. panic attacks, you can more efficiently address your mental health and the issues behind the attacks. It starts with understanding the more confusing of the two, anxiety attacks.</p>
<h2>What Are Anxiety Attacks? &#8211; Clinical Terms vs. Colloquial Terms</h2>
<p>“Anxiety attack” is not an official clinical term. The <a href="http://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/doi/book/10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">latest edition of the &#8220;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a>&#8221; [DSM-5], a book the vast majority of mental health professionals abide by, does not list it (we’ll be sure to update this article if that fact changes during the next release of the DSM).<span id="more-5622"></span></p>
<p>“Anxiety attack” is actually a colloquial term anxiety sufferers created to describe intense or extended periods of anxiety. An anxiety attack is more intense than a mere feeling of anxiety, but it isn’t as severe as a panic attack.</p>
<p>People began using the term because they felt like anxiety was attacking their life by interrupting periods of calmness, according to therapist <a href="http://www.yourchicagotherapist.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Helen Odessky</a>, author of “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stop-Anxiety-Stopping-You-Breakthrough/dp/1633535460" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stop Anxiety from Stopping You</a>.” Many clients used the term in therapy, so mental health professionals became aware of it and began forming more detailed definitions.</p>
<p>The definition and distinction between an anxiety attack vs. panic attack has become clearer, more refined. Nonetheless, there still isn’t an official definition of an anxiety attack.</p>
<p>By conducting research, interviewing anxiety experts and comparing definitions from various parties with clinical experience, we formulated a clear definition:</p>
<p><strong>The Definition of an Anxiety Attack</strong></p>
<p>An anxiety attack is an intense and/or extended period of anxiety. It is more severe than the simple feeling of anxiety but less severe than a panic attack. It can last anywhere from minutes to hours, even days and weeks.</p>
<p>It usually carries one or more of the following <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders/index.shtml#part_145336" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">symptoms</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restlessness, feeling wound-up or on edge</li>
<li>Being easily fatigued</li>
<li>Difficulty concentrating or having your mind go blank</li>
<li>Irritability</li>
<li>Muscle tension</li>
<li>Difficulty controlling worries</li>
<li>Sleep problems (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying sleep)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.nashvilleconciergecounseling.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Therapist Ginger Poag</a> defined an anxiety attack as, “a period of apprehension about possible future events.” Sometimes an anxiety attack is the prelude to a panic attack.</p>
<p>“I have had patients who have experienced an anxiety attack on their way to the airport because they have had a panic attack on the airplane,” Poag said.</p>
<p>Unlike panic attacks, anxiety attacks are not necessarily signs of an anxiety disorder. Anxiety is a natural response to certain stimuli or situations, and anxiety attacks are only more intense forms of that emotion.</p>
<p>Anxiety attacks often cause patterns of avoidance or excessive caution, said <a href="http://www.ctwomen.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">therapist Emma Levine</a>. For example, someone who has experienced anxiety attacks because of social anxiety might avoid the places or situations that have made him or her anxious.</p>

<h2>The Definition of a Panic Attack</h2>
<p>Panic attacks are easy to define because there is a <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/panic-attacks/basics/definition/con-20020825" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">clinical consensus on the definition</a>.</p>
<p>Here is an <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/287913-overview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">official definition from the DSM</a>:</p>
<p>“A panic attack is a sudden episode of intense fear that triggers severe physical reactions when there is no real danger or apparent cause.”</p>
<p>They usually have at least a few of the following symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sense of impending doom or danger</li>
<li>Fear of loss of control or death</li>
<li>Rapid, pounding heart rate</li>
<li>Sweating</li>
<li>Trembling or shaking</li>
<li>Shortness of breath or tightness in your throat</li>
<li>Chills</li>
<li>Hot flashes</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Abdominal cramping</li>
<li>Chest pain</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Dizziness, lightheadedness or faintness</li>
<li>Numbness or tingling sensation</li>
<li>Feeling of unreality or detachment</li>
</ul>
<p>These symptoms usually last 10-15 minutes. Sometimes sufferers think they are having a heart attack. Some rush to the hospital or call 911 because they don’t know it is a panic attack.</p>
<p>With panic attacks people usually feel a sense of immediate threat, Levine said. This causes them to respond by crying for help or trying to escape whatever predicament they are in.</p>
<p>Sometimes people only have one or two panic attacks in their lives. They usually happen under extreme amounts of stress or pressure.</p>
<p>Repeatedly experiencing panic attacks is usually a symptom of <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/panic-disorder-when-fear-overwhelms/index.shtml" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">panic disorder</a>. If you have this issue, consider <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_BOTTOM&amp;utr_adgroup=bottom-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002" target="_blank">working with a mental health professional</a>.</p>
<p>Certain traumatic events can eventually cause someone to develop panic disorder. For example, therapist Shannon Nuñez, who is also the Clinical Director at the <a href="https://pathwaytohope.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pathway to Hope</a> addiction treatment center, has worked with clients who developed panic disorder after witnessing sudden deaths. Witnessing a sudden death can make people feel like they could die in a moment and at any time, causing panic attacks.</p>
<h2>Anxiety Attack vs. Panic Attack: A Summary of the Differences</h2>
<p>So you can quickly compare and reference the key differences between an anxiety attack vs. a panic attack, we created the table below:</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-5625 aligncenter" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/table_2x-1024x550.png" alt="anxiety vs. panic attack comparison table" width="660" height="354" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/table_2x-1024x550.png 1024w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/table_2x-300x161.png 300w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/table_2x-768x412.png 768w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/table_2x.png 1326w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<h2>Why We Need To Make Sure People Understand the Difference</h2>
<p>While conducting research for this article, we encountered more than a dozen mental health professionals who mistakenly believed the terms “anxiety attack” and “panic attack” were synonymous. They were licensed professionals, but none of them had a specialty in anxiety. Because “anxiety attack” is not a clinical term, they assumed it was a synonym for “panic attack.” This caused them to use the terms interchangeably.</p>
<p>People who deal with anxiety attacks or panic attacks often make similar mistakes. Some suffer from panic attacks but use the term “anxiety attack” to describe their symptoms and vice versa.</p>
<p>This confusion is why potential therapy clients and other anxiety sufferers need to educate themselves or work with an anxiety specialist. If you don’t understand the terms and their differences, you might end up treating a panic disorder you don’t actually have. In the worst case scenario, you could become dependent on a medication you don’t need. That’s why it’s vital to seek out information about your specific condition and work with someone who is knowledgeable about the challenges that condition presents.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>If you are having a panic attack at work while reading this, please immediately follow the simple steps below (if not, skip this section):</h2>
<ol>
<li>Pull up this article on your phone so you can reference it after leaving your workstation.</li>
<li>Leave the situation you are in as soon as possible. If you need to, make an excuse such as needing to use the bathroom.</li>
<li>Head to the nearest place where you will have privacy or at least avoid interactions that will exacerbate the panic attack. It could be a small, private office, a phone booth, a bathroom stall, a bathroom for only one person or maybe outside the office.</li>
<li>Focus on your breathing. Try to take deep breaths through your nose and let your stomach expand. Continue this until your symptoms improve.</li>
<li>While you are breathing, remind yourself this isn’t your fault. You didn’t do anything wrong.</li>
<li>Counter the thought that might be causing or contributing to your panic attack. Now that you’ve found a place where you can better handle your symptoms, think about how safe you are. Nothing can hurt you right now. Everything is OK.</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6471;">Remember, you have handled panic attacks before. You were OK then and you will be OK now.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6471;">Focus on your breathing again.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6471;">Repeat steps 4-8 as many times as you need to. Remember, there is no rush. Everything is OK.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6471;">Head home if you need to. Your health is more important than trying to tough it out and get more work done.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6471;">Once the panic attack is over, congratulate yourself. Recognize how that satisfaction makes your body feel. Remember that feeling.</span></li>

<h2>Detailed Steps You Can Practice to Handle a Panic Attack at Work and Prepare for the Next One</h2>
<p>Use these next steps to prepare and practice in case there is another panic attack. You can also use them if the simple steps were not effective enough. Once you’re done reading, try combinations and make a custom method that works best for you.</p>
<h3>Realize When You Are Close to Having a Panic Attack</h3>
<p>Panic attacks don’t happen suddenly. They start creeping up an hour before people become aware of them, according to a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21783179" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study</a> published in the National Center of Biotechnology Information.</p>
<p>By memorizing the signs of an oncoming panic attack, you can better prepare for it and react quickly. Here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
<li>Heart racing</li>
<li>Dizziness</li>
<li>Chest pain</li>
<li>Hot flashes</li>
<li>Trembling</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Choking</li>
<li>Numbness</li>
</ul>
<p>If you experience any one of these symptoms, start using the simple (listed above) or detailed steps (keep reading) in this article. It might negate the panic attack or at least better prepare you.</p>
<h3>A More Advanced Technique for Handling a Panic Attack at Work: TIP</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/series-meet-our-therapists/" target="_blank">Talkspace therapist</a> Jessica Gilpert recommended people handle panic attacks using a technique called TIP. Here is how it works (remember to follow the steps in order):</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">T = Cold Temperature</span></strong></p>
<p>If you apply something cold to your body, it will help you calm down during a panic attack. When having a panic attack at work, try finding a bathroom so you can run cold water on your wrists or place a cold towel on your neck. If it’s cold outside, try going out for a bit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I = Intense Exercise</span></strong></p>
<p>Exercise will also help you calm down before and during a panic attack. Gilpert recommended running really fast in place, doing some jumping jacks and stretching the chest. Make sure you know where you can do these exercises without disturbing co-workers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lauraryan.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Therapist Laura L. Ryan</a> recommended running, a tactic that has helped several of her clients deal with panic attacks at work.</p>
<p>“I had a client in the past who was having up to 20 panic attacks per day and I suggested she carry running shoes in her purse so she could be prepared when she started to feel the panic coming on,” Ryan said. “She would step outside during her workday to speed walk/run for several minutes when she felt panicked and then return to the office when she was feeling normal again.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">P = Progressive Breathing</span></strong></p>
<p>Use the breathing techniques mentioned earlier. Remember to inhale through your nose, take deep breaths and allow your stomach to expand.</p>
<p>Talkspace therapist Alicia Winkle suggested breathing in through the nose for five seconds, holding a breath for five seconds and then exhaling for five seconds.</p>
<p>You can practice these techniques as part of TIP or separately.</p>

<h3>Progressive Muscle Relaxation [PMR]</h3>
<p>PMR is a great way to relax your body and mind. As the name suggests, it involves relaxing your muscles step-by-step. Here are some PMR steps Winkle recommended using for panic attacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Squeeze your fists as hard as possible</li>
<li>Keep them squeezed as you follow these next steps</li>
<li>Inhale through your nose for five seconds</li>
<li>Hold the breath for five seconds</li>
<li>Exhale for five seconds. As you exhale, release your fists.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Try variations on the numbers of seconds until you find the optimal time.</p>
<h3>The Power of Water</h3>
<p><a href="http://nicolemrichardson.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Therapist Nicole Richardson</a> recommended people drink eight ounces of cold water when having a panic attack. This tactic has worked with several of her clients, Richardson said.</p>
<p>It is also a good idea to splash cold water on your face and the back of your neck, said therapist Perpetua Neo. You can do this using a spray bottle, too.</p>
<h2>Preparing for Panic Attacks by Chatting with Co-Workers and Understanding Your Work Environment</h2>
<h3>Chatting with Supervisors and Co-Workers</h3>
<p>To minimize any damage to your professional relationships, consider telling your supervisors and human resource staff members you suffer from panic attacks. You can inform co-workers, too, if you feel comfortable doing so and think it will help the situation.</p>
<p>Remember, it is illegal for anyone to discriminate against you because of a mental illness, including a panic disorder.</p>
<h3>Recognize Triggers Around the Office</h3>
<p>If your panic attacks start in the workplace, there might be situations, people or objects that trigger them. Try to recognize these. It will help you further prepare.</p>
<p>You should not, however, avoid these triggers to the point where it affects your performance at work. If presentations are a trigger, it might be hard to skip them and keep your job.</p>
<p>Anticipating the panic attack might decrease your likelihood of engaging in certain activities at work, according to <a href="http://judemillerburke.com/home.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dr. Jude Miller Burke</a>, the former Vice President of OPTUM, United Health Group. This can prevent you from succeeding by taking on new and challenging responsibilities at work.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to recognize and prepare for triggers without anticipating a panic attack. To help the process, Burke suggested using a combination of psychotherapy, relaxation techniques and medication (more on these strategies later in the post).</p>
<h3>Carry or Use Counter Triggers: Objects or Actions That Calm You Down</h3>
<p>In the same way there are triggers that will start panic attacks, there are objects, people and situations that might calm you before or during an attack. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calling a family member or friend you are close to</li>
<li>Calling or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/unlimited-messaging-therapy/" target="_blank">texting a therapist</a></li>
<li>Holding a calming personal belonging with sentimental value such as a stuffed animal</li>
<li>Smelling salts (useful for people who are feeling faint)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Make a List of Optimal Places You Can Head To</h3>
<p>Being in a place you are comfortable in will help with panic attacks. Here are some examples of environments you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li>The passenger seat of your car (more room than the driver’s seat)</li>
<li>Use a private office if you have one. Draw blinds or curtains if you have them.</li>
<li>A single-person bathroom</li>
<li>A stall in a multi-person bathroom</li>
<li>Home (if it is close enough to quickly return to work)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Making Your Game Plan for Handling Panic Attacks at Work</h2>
<p>Now that you have the list of tactics, it’s time to customize and make your game plan for handling panic attacks at work. Here is an example of what that should look like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leave the situation</li>
<li>Head to the single-person bathroom</li>
<li>Take deep breaths</li>
<li>Use PMR</li>
<li>Call my therapist</li>
<li>Text my supervisor and inform her of what has happened</li>
<li>Go running</li>
<li>Head home</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you make this plan, put it somewhere easily accessible on your phone or a piece of paper you carry. Modify it as many times as needed. If you need help practicing or forming the plan, consider working with a therapist, someone who can act as a coach.</p>

<h2>Get to the Root of the Problem and Stop the Panic Attacks at Work: See a Therapist</h2>
<p>Being prepared for a panic attack at work is great, but the best solution is eliminating them. To do this, you’ll need to investigate the cause of the attacks. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/" target="_blank">Seeing a therapist</a> will help you understand what issues and behaviors are at the heart of your panic disorder.</p>
<p>“Panic attacks are the body&#8217;s way of shouting that you are ignoring your mind and feelings,” Neo said. Getting in touch with them will help.</p>
<h2>Consider Seeing a Psychiatrist</h2>
<p>If you need a supplement to therapy to take the edge off your symptoms, consider seeing a psychiatrist. He or she can work with you to find a medication that will help.</p>
<h2>Try Supplemental Lifestyle Changes Such as New Diets and Exercise Routines</h2>
<h3>Dieting</h3>
<p>Modifying your diet can reduce panic attacks, according to studies such as <a href="http://www.lib.okayama-u.ac.jp/www/acta/pdf/67_2_99.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this one</a> by Okayama University Medical School. <a href="http://www.theanxietysummit.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nutritionist Trudy Scott</a> has worked with clients who made the following research-supported diet changes as part of coping with their panic attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eating sources of quality protein, including eggs, a protein shake, grass-fed red meat and grass-fed beef jerky</li>
<li>Trying a gluten-free diet to see whether it makes a difference</li>
<li>Eating probiotic-rich foods such as yogurt and sauerkraut</li>
</ul>
<p>People who suffer with panic attacks can also work with experts and <a href="http://www.breakfreefromanxiety.com/3-secrets-webinar/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">organizations</a> to formulate specific diet plans, said Polly J. Meyers, the co-founder of <a href="http://www.breakfreefromanxiety.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BreakFreeFromAnxiety.com</a>.</p>
<p>“Your mind will go further with therapy after that,” Meyers told Talkspace.</p>
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>Exercising during a break in the work day can help with panic attacks. Exercise at any time will help prevent the development of other anxiety disorders, according to <a href="http://blog.smu.edu/research/2011/07/12/regular-exercise-may-help-prevent-the-development-of-panic-and-related-disorders/#more" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this study</a> from Southern Methodist University.</p>
<p>By using this article to form a plan to handle panic attacks at work, you should be set for the present. Then you can try a combination of therapy, dieting or exercise to secure a mentally healthy — and panic-free — future.</p>
