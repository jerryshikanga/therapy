				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve come a long way in our understanding of post-traumatic stress disorder. From the early designation of “shell shock” for military veterans to transforming the label of “hysteric” to PTSD for survivors of rape, we know that trauma can have lasting physical and emotional effects on those who experience it.</p>
<p>However, often we default to discussing only soldiers and victims of sexual violence when we talk about PTSD. These experiences are certainly among the leading causes of the mental illness, yet they aren’t the only type of trauma that result in PTSD. Let’s expand on how trauma of any kind changes us and how that impacts the way we think about PTSD.</p>
<p><span id="more-10264"></span></p>
<h2>Looking at Big ‘T’ Trauma</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/recognizing-trauma-vs-ptsd-quick-primer-symptoms/" target="_blank">Trauma</a> is generally categorized by what experts call big ‘T’ trauma or little ‘t’ trauma. Officially, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/ptsd/" target="_blank">PTSD</a> diagnoses result after big ‘T’ trauma, events that anyone would consider extremely distressing. Combat and sexual violence certainly qualify, but so do major car accidents, plane crashes, and living through natural disasters.</p>
<p>Following Hurricane Sandy in 2012, for example, a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24558743" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study</a> that screened residents along the New Jersey coast found that 14.5 percent of adults were likely suffering from PTSD six months after the hurricane hit.</p>
<p>Add to the list school shootings, terrorist attacks, residing in war zones; relational violence like domestic abuse, physical abuse, and emotional abuse; to the violence of incarceration and crime — PTSD-causing big ‘T’ trauma casts a wide net.</p>
<p>“I have PTSD from being in prison and the gang life,” Alan B. revealed to <a href="https://themighty.com/2018/06/ptsd-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-pictures/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Mighty</a>. “When I was released from prison I was nearly murdered by the gang I was involved in. I have nightmares of that night still and it makes me paranoid. Although that lifestyle is not a part of my life anymore, it still haunts me.”</p>
<h2>Witnessing Trauma</h2>
<p>PTSD can also be caused by witnessing trauma happening to others, or learning a loved one has experienced a traumatic event. According to a <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2013/trauma_mental_health_20130806/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">World Health Organization</a> survey of citizens in 21 countries, 10 percent of respondents reported witnessing violence (21.8 percent; the largest response in the survey) and trauma to a loved one (12.5 percent).</p>
<h3>Post-9/11 PTSD: A Case Study</h3>
<p>The most recognizable case of this phenomenon followed the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. As of 2011, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/nyregion/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-from-911still-haunts.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>The New York Times</i></a> reported that three 9/11-specific health organizations found “at least 10,000 firefighters, police officers, and civilians exposed to the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center have been found to have post-traumatic stress disorder.”</p>
<p>First responders who were — and are everyday — on the frontlines of such tragedy have a high risk of developing PTSD from what they witness. A 2017 <a href="https://www.phoenix.edu/about_us/media-center/news/uopx-releases-first-responder-mental-health-survey-results.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">survey</a> found that around 30 percent of first responders lived with PTSD, including firefighters, police officers, paramedics, and other emergency workers.</p>
<p>It’s not just first responders. Those who were in the city at the time of 9/11, even if they weren’t in the World Trade Center at the time of the attacks, have also been diagnosed with PTSD. Like with any witnessed trauma, it shakes one’s sense of safety because it happened so close to home. It leaves lasting emotional ties that come with many daily reminders.</p>
<p>“It’s the places you see every day,” Charles Figley, a Tulane University School of Social Work professor, explained to <i>The New York Times</i>. “Where you proposed to your wife, where you remember getting the news that you got promoted, where your young children played.”</p>
<p>Even those who witnessed the graphic news coverage on television following the attacks were at risk for developing PTSD. The <a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/trauma/basics/media-coverage-traumatic-events.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">National Center for PTSD</a> points to a study that found in the three to five days following 9/11, survey participants who reported watching the most TV showed “more substantial stress reactions than those who watched less.”</p>
<h2>Big ‘T’ Versus Little ‘t’ Trauma</h2>
<p>The causes above cover what the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders</i> specifies in diagnosing PTSD: “Exposure to actual or threatened death serious injury, or sexual violence” and witnessing “the event(s) as it occurred to others.” As researchers delve deeper into PTSD, they are finding that these qualifications may be limiting.</p>
<p>We talked about big ‘T’ trauma, but there’s also that little ‘t’ trauma. Little ‘t’ traumas are classified as stressful events that happen to all of us at one point or another. Think more “personal” stressors, like job changes, messy breakups, unplanned major expenses, and the loss of a loved one.</p>
<p>These instances, which seriously challenge our ability to cope, have traditionally been left out of the conversation about PTSD. It’s believed they’re just not “enough” to cause mental illness. However, this may not turn out to be true, as our understanding of trauma advances.</p>
<p>“One of the most overlooked aspects of small ‘t’ traumas is their accumulated effect,” writes psychologist Elyssa Barbash in <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/trauma-and-hope/201703/different-types-trauma-small-t-versus-large-t" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Psychology Today</i></a>. “While one small ‘t’ trauma is unlikely to lead to significant distress, multiple compounded small ‘t’ traumas, particularly in a short span of time, are more likely to lead to an increase in distress and trouble with emotional functioning.”</p>
<h2>Expanding How We Approach PTSD</h2>
<p>Barbash stops short of saying that a collection of small ‘t’ traumas can cause PTSD, but admits “it is possible that a person can develop some trauma response symptoms.” Psychotherapist Sara Staggs offers a similar perspective in her blog for <a href="https://blogs.psychcentral.com/after-trauma/2014/02/the-big-deal-with-little-t-traumas/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Psych Central</a>, pointing out that PTSD and stress reactions following trauma are tied not so much to the event itself but to the way our brain processes the information.</p>
<p>“Then there is any other type of event which exceeds our capacity to cope, and can be stored as trauma,” Staggs said. “To some degree, it doesn’t matter what propels us into fight-flight-freeze mode, but only that the event was experienced and then stored that way.”</p>
<h3>How the Brain Stores Traumatic Memories</h3>
<p>We know that the brain stores traumatic memories differently than regular ones. These memories are so overwhelming our brain doesn’t process them completely the first time around. Staggs describes it as the difference between putting your canned goods neatly away on the shelf versus shoving everything in a cabinet and slamming the door shut in a hurry.</p>
<p>The latter is how the brain might handle traumatic information, which can lead to the tell-tale symptoms of PTSD: <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/happens-brain-ptsd-flashback/" target="_blank">flashbacks</a> and nightmares, isolation, dissociation, emotional detachment, heightened anxiety, and avoidance of trauma reminders, among other symptoms.</p>
<h3>What We Know About PTSD’s Development</h3>
<p>Additional research suggests there are many factors at play that determine who develops PTSD, since only an estimated <a href="http://www.ptsd.ne.gov/what-is-ptsd.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">3.6 percent of the global population</a> lives with the illness in any given year. Not all of us who experience trauma will develop PTSD, even if we’ve lived through or witnessed the same exact experience.</p>
<p>For example, we’re more susceptible when we’ve had a major trauma in the past. There may be a genetic predisposition to PTSD. Having limited social support following a stressful event also increases our risk for PTSD, as does experiencing multiple traumas at the same time. In time, how trauma is defined when diagnosing PTSD may change to incorporate a growing understanding of how we’re impacted by traumas large and small.</p>
<h2>Seeking Help for PTSD</h2>
<p>By expanding how we look at PTSD beyond just <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/05/facts-veterans-ptsd/" target="_blank">veterans</a> and rape survivors, we can raise awareness that there are many traumatic experiences that can lead to PTSD. And when we do that, we reduce the stigma of reaching out for help when we need it.</p>
<p>“With sufficient support most people are resilient, most people can work through the effects of post-traumatic stress,” psychologist Arielle Schwartz told <a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/ptsd/ptsd-stigma/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Everyday Health</a>. “Seeking support is not something to be shameful for. It’s something that all humans need.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh, the internet. Home of cute cat videos, sarcastic memes that make us cackle, social media to engage with anyone anywhere, and lightning-fast news with real-time live video. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>For better or worse, the internet has largely become how we consume and share information and interact with others from every corner of the world. Because of its vast and complex nature, it’s hard to determine just how the internet impacts those who use it on a daily basis. But what about for those of us who live with post-traumatic stress disorder? Does the internet make PTSD worse?</p>
<p><span id="more-10253"></span></p>
<p>There may be little scientific research on the topic currently, but through two unofficial case studies — the online proliferation of the #MeToo movement and the uptick in graphic content on the internet — let’s take a closer look at the relationship between <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/complex-ptsd-versus-standard-ptsd/">PTSD</a> and the internet.</p>
<h2>Case Study: #MeToo</h2>
<p>The #MeToo movement broke online following the sexual harassment allegations against entertainment mogul Harvey Weinstein in fall 2017. People took to social media in droves to share their #MeToo stories — times when they have experienced sexual harassment — and new accusations against celebrities came out daily. It was impossible to escape reminders of sexual violence online.</p>
<p>For the <a href="https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">94 percent</a> of those who experience PTSD symptoms two weeks after a rape, and the 30 percent who experience PTSD nine months or longer, being inundated with reminders of our own trauma is bound to have an impact.</p>
<h3>Trigger Central</h3>
<p>Actress Evan Rachel Wood perhaps summed it up best when she <a href="https://twitter.com/evanrachelwood/status/929075650522001408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">tweeted</a> on Nov. 17, 2017, a month after #MeToo caught like wildfire: “Has anyone else’s PTSD been triggered thru the roof? I hate that these feelings of danger are coming back.”</p>
<p>Wood perfectly captures one of the hallmarks of PTSD: reminders of our own trauma. These “triggers” can set off the same fight-flight-freeze response that happens during an actual traumatic event. For someone whose perpetrator wore a certain cologne or perfume, for example, smelling the same fragrance in our daily life can take us back to that moment in time we were in danger. We experience these terrifying memories, body sensations, and other physiological responses as if they were happening in the present.</p>
<p>Depending on the strength of the trigger — say reading a story online of a sexual assault that bears a strong resemblance to our own — those with PTSD may experience difficult symptoms such as flashbacks, debilitating <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/different-types-anxiety-disorders-classified/" target="_blank">anxiety</a>, or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/dealing-depression-need-know/" target="_blank">depression</a>, which can be disruptive and even lead to suicidal thoughts. In this way, the internet definitely can make PTSD worse.</p>
<p>“After the #MeToo campaign blew up online, the flashbacks and anxiety raged back with tremendous force,” Anna Johnson wrote for <a href="https://themighty.com/2017/11/the-negative-effect-of-the-metoo-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Mighty</a>. “As the stories continued to flood my social media and news pages, I had to significantly limit my time on these pages. In reading everyone’s stories, it felt like I was reliving my own trauma.”</p>
<h3>Building Community</h3>
<p>On the other hand, the proliferation of #MeToo across the internet also sends a powerful message that we are not alone. This can build a sense of community online, social support that University of Alabama psychology professor James Hamilton told <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-its-like-to-watch-metoo-when-it-is-you-too/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FiveThirtyEight</a> “is a key protective factor against the development of PTSD.”</p>
<p>“[It’s] a way of understanding the universalism basically of, ‘I&#8217;m not the only one,’” Talkspace therapist <a href="http://ourtherapycenter.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cynthia V. Catchings</a>, LCSW, adds. “There are other people that are speaking up. There are other people that went through the same experience that I&#8217;ve had and I am now able to either share my experience or at least know that there are other people that I can identify with.”</p>
<p>For those who don’t have people in their lives who understand the nature of PTSD, or for those who choose to remain anonymous in their real-life social circles, the internet may be the only place to find much-needed support. However, for those with PTSD, perhaps given the amount of triggers on the internet and social media, some experts suggest it may be in-person interactions that truly create a healing community.</p>
<p>“On the surface, Facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling such needs by allowing people to instantly connect,” write the authors of a study published in <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0069841&amp;mbid=synd_msnhealth" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PLOS One</a> on well-being and Facebook use in young people. “Rather than enhancing well-being, as frequent interactions with supportive &#8216;offline&#8217; social networks powerfully do, the current findings demonstrate that interacting with Facebook may predict the opposite result for young adults — it may undermine it.”</p>
<h2>Case Study: Graphic Online News</h2>
<p>Because it’s more or less an open source to post anything with few filters, the advent of social media and the internet gives us all access to more graphic content. For those with PTSD, explicit online news coverage, especially when we happen across it unexpectedly, can trigger PTSD symptoms. But this type of online content is so potent, it’s enough to <i>cause</i> PTSD.</p>
<p>In 2015 University of Bradford psychologist Pam Ramsden <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/05/150506164240.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">studied</a> how viewing violent news content online affected study participants with no previous trauma history. Similar to how first responders or emergency workers might be at risk for developing PTSD, it turns out so too are those who watch the same graphic events unfold online.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is quite worrying that nearly a quarter of those who viewed the images scored high on clinical measures of PTSD,” Ramsden concluded. “With increased access to social media and the internet via tablets and smartphones, we need to ensure that people are aware of the risks of viewing these images and that appropriate support is available for those who need it.&#8221;</p>
<p>This assertion is also made by experts such as forensic cyberpsychologist Mary Aiken, who shared with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/31/facebookmoderators-develop-ptsd-exposed-worst-content-internet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Telegraph</a> that “we see post-traumatic stress disorder, early signs of it, in the content moderators who are looking at extreme content. It&#8217;s only a matter of time before we see post-traumatic stress disorder in children who are looking at extreme content.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Internet-Based Treatment Options</h2>
<p>While it’s not looking so great for the internet and its connection to PTSD, there are some truly positive benefits of internet access, mainly thanks to a broader scope of resources. For example, on a basic level, internet-based platforms allow those with PTSD to find information about the illness and potential professional support that just wasn’t possible before the internet. Many mental health professionals are using this to their (and their clients’) advantage.</p>
<p>“I find that college students are quicker to check Facebook and Twitter statuses than their email, so using social media has been one way for us to promote and distribute information on healthy living and outreach events,” New York-based counselor Sarah Spiegelhoff shared with <a href="https://ct.counseling.org/2014/01/game-on-technology-as-counseling-tool/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Counseling Today</a>. “I also share information related to new apps that promote wellness both through our social media accounts and directly in counseling sessions.”</p>
<p>In a more direct manner, some models use the internet as the main delivery method for treatment, which is advantageous because mental health care is inaccessible to so many. And results show a promising improvement in PTSD symptoms so for. A 2017 study published in the journal <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28557299" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Depression and Anxiety</i></a>, for example, tested an internet-based self-help model. Online modules focused on teaching clinically based PTSD treatments such as grounding, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/09/different-types-therapy-psychotherapy-best/" target="_blank">cognitive therapy</a>, and relaxation techniques, which had positive benefits for participants.</p>
<p>So we may have the internet to thank for online-based services that provide access to support for those living with PTSD, like Talkspace. However, the free-range nature of life online, despite the sense of community and belonging it can create, is rife with triggers and the potential to cause more harm than good. This may not be true for everybody, and we certainly can’t just shut the internet down. But for those of us with PTSD — it might be best to proceed with caution.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your palms sweat. Your heart races. You don’t remember where you are — are you here, now, or back in another, scarier time?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/happens-brain-ptsd-flashback/" target="_blank">This is a flashback</a>. And for many people living with PTSD, it’s a common experience. Faced with a reminder of a traumatic event, someone with PTSD can be jerked back into the mental, emotional and even physical experience of trauma.</p>
<p>But what happens when that trauma is ongoing, or a prolonged series of events? This is where a Complex PTSD diagnosis bridges an important behavioral health gap.</p>
<p><span id="more-9483"></span></p>
<h2>Basic Differences between PTSD and Complex PTSD</h2>
<p>For many people with PTSD, this traumatic event was a singular occurrence: A natural disaster, or a single violent assault. But for survivors of ongoing trauma, flashbacks and other symptoms can be particularly intense. These survivors may suffer from a different form of PTSD, called “Complex PTSD” (C-PTSD) — also referred to as “disorders of extreme stress not otherwise specified.”</p>
<p>While the label Complex PTSD is still fairly new, <a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/ptsd-overview/complex-ptsd.asp" target="_blank">many therapists and researchers</a> believe that C-PTSD should have its own diagnosis, separate from simple PTSD. Recently, in fact, Complex PTSD even received its own mention in the <a href="http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/ptsd/ptsd-dsm-5-understanding-changes" target="_blank">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual</a> (DSM).</p>
<p>Wherever individual therapists stand on Complex PTSD’s difference from PTSD, one thing is certain: If you’ve experienced trauma and are suffering, you deserve care. And you <i>can </i>heal. Here’s how.</p>
<h2>What is Complex PTSD?</h2>
<p>We know that PTSD is the result of a traumatic event. Some scientists describe it as as the body’s <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4b23/ea9c7c6c9b6216d21c0c94d405d34b1c2290.pdf" target="_blank">evolutionary defense mechanism</a> to intense stress, with the symptoms of PTSD actually serving to keep you aware of future threat. Of course, what might have worked for ancient humans doesn’t necessarily work for residents of the modern world, and PTSD can seriously interrupt the daily lives of people who suffer from it.</p>
<p>For people who have been victimized by many traumatic events over a period of time, the struggle to survive and grow after trauma can be a long one. Complex PTSD is different from PTSD because it often occurs in people who’ve experienced extreme violence and stress over an extended period of time. These stressful events make the person feel trapped and thus hopeless — they may be physically or psychologically unable to escape.</p>
<h2>Who is at risk for Complex PTSD?</h2>
<p>People who have experienced ongoing domestic violence, severe child abuse, sexual abuse, war, police violence, or forced (non-consensual) sex work are all at risk of developing Complex PTSD. That doesn’t mean if you’ve experienced any of these things, you’re guaranteed to develop C-PTSD. But if you do struggle with Complex PTSD, remember that you’re not broken or alone — you’re having a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder" target="_blank">very common</a> and understandable reaction to a really difficult experience.</p>
<p>People with Complex PTSD will generally experience common PTSD symptoms like flashbacks, nightmares, and physical reminders of the event like nervousness or increased heart rate. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/mental-health-diary-ptsd/" target="_blank">They may also try to avoid or block out memories of the traumatic even</a>t, emotionally numbing themselves so that, eventually, they may not feel anything at all.</p>
<p>Because people who suffer Complex PTSD experienced long-term and particularly violent trauma, they may exhibit <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/complex/" target="_blank">additional symptoms</a>. These include feeling shame and guilt, including a false idea that you are responsible for what happened to you (of course, you’re not at all!). People with Complex PTSD may also experience periods of dissociation, meaning they will lose attention, concentration, and connection to their immediate surroundings as a defense mechanism against overwhelming stress. These symptoms can understandably make it hard for people with C-PTSD to navigate relationships and daily life.</p>
<h2>How is Complex PTSD Treated?</h2>
<p>While the symptoms of Complex PTSD are definitely serious, you can heal. The most important step to getting better? Reaching out for help. A therapist trained to work with trauma survivors can lead you down the path to healing.</p>
<p>The first goal of treatment for Complex PTSD is stabilization, meaning that <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/09/experience-person-versus-online-therapy/" target="_blank">the therapist will help you separate the traumatic past from the present</a>. The therapist can teach you techniques, called “grounding techniques,” to stay in the here and now, where you are safe, rather than feeling threat and panic from the past.</p>
<p>You can think of grounding techniques as helping you keep your feet on the ground, in the present — sometimes literally. Therapists suggest walking barefoot and feeling the ground beneath your toes as one strategy to keep yourself in the here and now. Other <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/dissociative-disorders/self-care/#.WrYd4dNuaT8" target="_blank">grounding techniques</a> can include paying attention to the sounds, sights, smells and textures in the present, or going somewhere safe and cozy and paying attention to those comforting feelings.</p>
<p>Your therapist may also use specific trauma-focused therapeutic techniques, like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/" target="_blank">CBT</a>) or Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy (<a href="http://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/treatments/eye-movement-reprocessing.aspx" target="_blank">EMDR</a>).</p>
<h2>You Can Heal</h2>
<p>With so much trauma in this world, PTSD and Complex PTSD are unfortunately common.Surviving something emotionally, physically, or mentally traumatic will definitely have effects, as your body and mind struggle to adapt and heal. Having Complex PTSD doesn’t mean you’re wrong, broken, or hopeless — it means you’re having a totally understandable reaction to intense trauma, and <a href="http://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy" target="_blank">you deserve care</a>.</p>
<p>The road won’t necessarily be easy, but Complex PTSD <i>can </i>be treated, and you can lead a normal, healthy, and happy life defined by what <i>you </i>want to make of it — not by past trauma.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Giving birth can be one of the biggest events in a person’s life, and it’s a loaded experience. Everyone has expectations about what a “good birth” looks like, but birth doesn’t always go as planned. For some parents feelings of disappointment, fear, or stress about the events surrounding the birth of a beloved child can transition into something more serious: birth trauma, also known as perinatal PTSD. This condition is a lot more common than you might think.</p>
<p>Our expanding understanding of psychological trauma has highlighted the fact that PTSD is an issue much broader than the emotional aftermath of experiencing combat. Any intense traumatic experience can have psychological ramifications, whether someone has a history of mental health conditions or not, and no matter how well-prepared someone might be. Birth, accompanied with intense physical and emotional experiences, is no exception. But the myths surrounding pregnancy and childbirth can make people uncomfortable when it comes to speaking out, or uncertain about whether what they’re experiencing is normal.<span id="more-8682"></span></p>
<p>“I just kept replaying every moment from when I first started getting contractions to when I gave birth,” Rebekah Sanderlin told Talkspace.</p>
<p>When she gave birth to her second child, she was living far apart from her family while her husband was on deployment. Nearly everything that could have gone wrong did. She went into labor in the middle of a hurricane, had trouble reaching the hospital, and was treated dismissively by hospital staff at intake. While the actual process of labor and delivery went as smoothly as it ever can, and her child was born happy and healthy, the experience haunted her.</p>
<p>Like many people who develop PTSD, Sanderlin became obsessed with ruminating on the series of events surrounding her delivery, feeling “stuck, like a broken record.” When she compared notes with other new parents, she found that they didn’t share her experiences. Nonetheless, it didn’t occur to her to identify the issue as PTSD until much later.</p>
<p>Doctor Mary Kimmel, the medical director of UNC’s Perinatal Psychiatry Inpatient Unit, has considerable experience working with patients who are struggling with complex and unexpected emotions both before and after birth. Flashbacks, like those Sanderlin experienced, are not uncommon, but her patients also have nightmares, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/different-types-anxiety-disorders-classified/" target="_blank">anxiety</a>, hypervigilance, and feelings of being on edge. Sometimes patients arrive with a mix of mental health conditions, including perinatal mood disorders like <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/dealing-depression-need-know/" target="_blank">depression</a> and anxiety. At other times the PTSD presents on its own.</p>
<p>Limited <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1348/014466500163095/abstract" target="_blank">research on this subject</a> indicates it is a very real problem, but the precise number of birth parents who experience it is unclear. Kimmel, however, says it may be as high as 5% of pregnancies. While “trauma” often seems to imply an unplanned, unexpected, scary situation — like an emergency C-section — it can happen in births that are fairly ordinary, too. Kimmel notes that people who feel a loss of control, as though the situation is being rushed and they don&#8217;t have an opportunity to actively participate in making choices, can be at higher risk, especially if a sense of helplessness accompanies that emotion.</p>
<p>That observation is echoed by Katherine Clover, who entered a hospital as a home birth transfer after several frustrating days of painful labor. She ultimately needed a C-section, saying: “It was this very scary sense of having no power or control.” Even as she was supported by hospital staff, the rapid transition in her birth plan left her feeling unmoored.</p>
<p>Clover didn’t identify what she was experiencing until months after the birth, when she sought counseling to help her sift through the complicated emotions that followed her son’s weaning. Coincidentally, she reached a therapist who specialized in postpartum care, something Kimmel says is important.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">Therapy</a> allows you to tell your story and have a place to process that story,” says Kimmel, who adds that she loves her job working with parents and families. In some cases, medication can also help patients get stable so they can take their time with clinical treatments.</p>
<p>Sanderlin and Clover are open about their experiences, with Sanderlin reaching out to new parents to let them know they might experience a mix of complicated emotions. The decision to share stories is somewhat unusual, though. Kimmel says it can be “hard to talk about your birth experience,” especially when you “feel you have all these negative emotions.” In a world where birth is supposed to be a beautiful, spiritual, affirming event, people with perinatal PTSD may feel slightly out of step.</p>
<p>In pregnancy there can be a sense that planning for unfortunate circumstances puts a jinx on the experience. Despite this concern, Kimmel notes that there are some steps people can take to mitigate the risks of birth trauma, and Clover says having a specific mental health plan in advance can be highly beneficial. But it’s important to remember that, as with other mental health conditions, it’s not possible to prevent birth trauma. Even a meticulously-planned pregnancy and delivery experience can’t account for everything.</p>
<p>Kimmel says it can be helpful for parents to work with the local hospital to tour the labor and delivery area and meet the staff there. This preparatory step can make it seem less scary and overwhelming on the day of. That goes for home births, too: If something goes wrong, the hospital shouldn’t feel like an unknown frontier for someone who is already worried and unhappy that a birth isn’t going as planned. Getting a neonatal intensive care unit [NICU] tour can also be helpful. Hopefully it’s a tour of a place you’ll never see again. Nonetheless, knowing what it looks like, what babies who need intensive care look like, and who works there can be an anchor of familiarity at a scary time.</p>
<p>Birth plans can also help expecting parents think ahead and regain some measure of control in chaotic situations.</p>
<p>“We need to do a better job of discussing birth with people, and talking about the things that can happen,” says Kimmel, who says that during her medical training as an obstetrical intern, the process of communicating often felt rushed or poorly timed.</p>
<p>Making sure everyone on the care team is on the same page is tremendously helpful, but so is a frank conversation about what will happen in an emergency. If a baby goes into distress, parents need to have confidence in a medical team that doesn’t have time to explain what needs to happen and why. Patients should be able to think, “I&#8217;m doing my best, I have a team I trust, they’re doing their best,” says Kimmel.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that pregnancy and childbirth are accompanied by intense emotions is also important. Even people without a history of mental health conditions can benefit from therapy during and after pregnancy to talk about what’s happening in their lives. Those who have a history of PTSD, depression, or other mental health conditions — or traumatic events that might be reopened during birth — should specifically have a mental health plan, argues Clover.</p>
<p>“Have a specific plan,” she said. “Have a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a> already.”</p>
<p>She suggests sourcing local phone numbers to call for help and talking with family members about what to do. “Be kind to yourself,” says Kimmel, something Clover agrees with. Birth trauma “isn’t anybody’s fault, but you can get help and there really is no reason to wait.” It’s better to have this information and not need it than to be in distress and not have it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During my first Christmas in Iraq, we were hit by a roadside bomb. It could have been worse. Luckily, no one died in this explosion. Back at the firebase, we were allowed a call on the satellite phone. Some people freely told their parents or loved ones about what had happened. I felt that unbecoming of an infantryman—why scare people back home?—instead I settled on my favorite topic: the weather. Oh stoic me.</p>
<p>Half a year later I was touring Europe with a friend of mine from the same platoon. I wouldn’t say we had seen all that much action, yet there was an anger that was evident in both of us. A hundred and fifty miles per hour seemed too slow. We threw our wrath at anyone in our way. Verbal wrath, but troublesome nonetheless. Whatever I was experiencing I merely concealed by being a stranger in a strange land: the prattle of a foreign language and people going about their way provided a perfect cocoon for me.<span id="more-8384"></span></p>
<p>It’s an odd thing to look back at the young man I once was. I’m aware of the alchemy involved to truly capture my frame of mind back then, to not assign some current epiphany, some current vocabulary back into the past, into my memories in some half-baked attempt to smooth out who I was then with who I am now. It would be remiss of me not to mention that I was experiencing a state of mind — along with all the accompanying feelings — of which I was not aware, and to which I truly had no words for.</p>
<p>Instead it was easier to grasp other words, other phrases, other slogans that were readily available in my zeitgeist. I’m speaking of grasping my role as a soldier — a word coherent to both the civilian and military world —and all the inherent values of that role: be it from movies or other soldiers around me or what have you. As I’m writing, these bubble forth, words and states from another time: with us or against us, honor, fight for your freedoms.</p>
<p>Of course, this role includes belonging to a community, along with all the sacrifices required at the altar of a mission, of doing for the person next to you. This is the brotherhood one hears referred to often. And indeed, in that teamwork one can easily find something to lose oneself to, something to keep the demons at bay and eat up any time for reflection.</p>
<p>Perhaps I’m being too harsh. This teamwork is something that started early in the military. It was in basic training that I was indoctrinated into the culture and belief system of the Army. It included this idea of a brotherhood, though it also introduced a very measured separation between us and the civilians we were protecting. This mental separation is now something I’m trying to overcome, but back then it was a welcome way to help with the very real distance between me and the civilian world.</p>
<p>After being through the military, I could not, cannot, help having a different outlook on life, a different worldview than those who did not serve. I don’t only mean my stoicism, like on that Christmas phone call back home. I’m talking about the different cultures, about how no longer having the same idea of teamwork — that brotherhood again—represents a loss or at least a gap to be filled.</p>
<p>This chasm says something of the effects on my mind, to my mental health. Because it’s almost a question of understanding one’s reality: how to work with the person next to you — individuality or teamwork; how you see the world — the easy talk of war as a panacea or as a curse; how you take in the news—naively or cynically. If the chasm between me and my fellow citizen is too wide, my reality stretches to the breaking point, somewhere beyond reckless driving.</p>
<p>When I drive I don’t speed any more. Too old, perhaps. Or maybe a sign of coming back to normal. It’s been a Sisyphean ordeal. To bridge the chasm I’ve been reading as much about the world as possible—part of a self-enforced reeducation. All that young me did, he did under great misconceptions. If that brotherhood was a powerful drug, so too was my ignorance, a sin I might forever be recovering from.</p>
<p>Reading history and literature brings new knowledge and plants my feet on firmer ground, sheds light on the chasm even if it doesn’t always bridge it. I have also turned to writing about the world to help assuage my guilt, to communicate with that world. Fiction, non-fiction. I mentioned how I didn’t have the vocabulary back then to understand what I was going through. I should clarify that even now it’s an ongoing process, still searching for the words. I write, a man possessed. Perhaps the attempt is futile. I note the very different reactions from veterans (no matter the war) and civilians, yet I keep writing. Chasm. Ignorance. What else is there but to keep trying to reach to my fellow human?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Talkspace’s Mental Health Diary series provides an intimate, anonymous week-long look inside the lives of those struggling with mental illness. Our first diary entry is from a Digital Content Producer and Journalist coping with the lingering effects of sexual abuse. Female // 30s // Los Angeles.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> PTSD; Secondary: borderline personality disorder, OCD, depression<br />
<strong>Occupation:</strong> Digital Content Producer; Journalist<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Los Angeles<br />
<strong>Medication:</strong> Luvox, Abilify, (Prozac); Xanax as needed<br />
<strong>Therapy:</strong> Two 90-minute in-person therapy sessions a week; Talkspace therapist; Bi-weekly trauma group therapy; Weekly DBT skills group<br />
<strong>Health Insurance:</strong> Cigna; (Blue Shield)</p>
<h2>DAY 1</h2>
<p><strong>7:45 a.m.</strong><br />
I get out of bed on the fifth alarm and throw on clothing to get out the door in 10 minutes or less to make it to work on time. Basic self-care stuff baffles me, so I do the best I can in jeans and some rumpled shirt that really should be washed.<span id="more-6512"></span></p>
<p><strong>9 a.m.</strong><br />
I’m at my full-time job and writing to my Talkspace therapist about not going to the grocery store because I have no idea how to feed myself and the whole thing is overwhelming. I’ve already checked on my cats via security camera twice — no catastrophes yet. I check on them at least every hour, making sure they’re safe, that my apartment didn’t burn down.</p>
<p><strong>3 p.m.</strong><br />
I wake up from a lunchtime nap. I don’t really remember what I was working on before lunch. It’s all a blur. Things have a way of blurring together and I don’t remember what I was doing.</p>
<p><strong>5 p.m.</strong><br />
My in-person therapist texts me and I get a jolt of panic. She is rescheduling my appointment from tonight to tomorrow. I am always afraid she is going to cancel my appointments and will abandon me.</p>
<p><strong>8 p.m.</strong><br />
I have been home from work a few hours and I read Roxane Gay’s Hunger, which touches on trauma and the way it forever impacts the body, mind, and soul. It’s nice to know I am not alone, and I find this book powerful, vulnerable, and all too relatable.</p>
<p><strong>10 p.m.</strong><br />
I’ve cleaned the litter box and taken my meds, but I can’t fall asleep despite the guided sleep meditation, which hilariously starts with a warning not to listen while operating heavy machinery.</p>
<p><strong>2:13 a.m.</strong><br />
Wake up and go back to sleep.</p>
<h2>DAY 2</h2>
<p><strong>6:40 a.m.</strong><br />
Wake up and go back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>7:35 a.m.</strong><br />
My first alarm goes off but I ignore it and the next one. At 7:45 I get ready for work, tired. I can’t forget to pay my rent, bring my recorder, or notebook. Rent, notebook, recorder. Rent, notebook, recorder, I repeat as I wash my face. I plug in the security camera, get down on my hands and knees to check on the cat under the bed. Fine. I throw on my sneakers and grab my bag and pet the other cat goodbye. I close and lock the apartment door, saying my mantra, “Please keep the cats safe, Lord.” I’m not religious. And then I am off, driving to work.</p>
<p><strong>10:30 a.m.</strong><br />
I bite my nails and try to catch up on the news. I scroll through headlines, check my email, start a project, check my email, check on the cats, check Facebook, write interview questions. I’m all over the place and uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>1 p.m.</strong><br />
I eat my food truck grilled cheese and fries, which I get so often the food truck people know my name. It comforts me and I am focused on work. Once I am absorbed in a task the anxiety falls away.</p>
<p><strong>5:30 p.m.</strong><br />
I leave work 30 minutes early for therapy, an 1.5 hour drive across the city in traffic.</p>
<p><strong>7:30 p.m.</strong><br />
Therapy. We talk about my fear of the grocery store and needing proper nutrients — or to be honest, any nutrients. We make a healthy shopping list for the store together. I struggle with the self-care — somehow high-level work tasks are easy, but simple things like brushing my teeth are difficult.</p>
<p>My psychiatrist missed my phone appointment earlier, so my therapist gets him on speakerphone while I list my symptoms from a list, my therapist filling in the gaps: trouble sleeping, flashbacks/weird dreams, panic/overwhelm, difficulty with self-care, isolation, avoidance, helplessness, dissociation, derealization, depersonalization, thought-blocking, slow cognitive processing, depression, racing thoughts, rage, lack of motivation/interest, agoraphobia, intrusive memories.</p>
<p>He adds Prozac to the Luvox and Abilify I am already taking. I close in on myself a little, feeling exposed and like a failure. I don’t like listing my symptoms because I am trying so hard to pretend everything is normal, that mental illness doesn’t impact my life. It does.</p>
<p><strong>10 p.m.</strong><br />
I am home from therapy. My cats chase each other while I agonize over what to do. I decide to tackle some work. I’m too wired for sleep right now anyway. Plus I didn’t eat dinner. I should do that, right?</p>
<p><strong>11 p.m.</strong><br />
Bedtime. My mind races. I want to keep working, panicked now. Work is how I avoid dealing with the harder thoughts and memories — I can drown them out with sheer willpower. I know I need to sleep though. I turn on the guided sleep meditation.</p>
<h2>DAY 3</h2>
<p><strong>5:55 a.m.</strong><br />
I have a dream I slept through all eight of my alarms and it’s now 9 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. I’m confused, and it takes me a couple minutes to reorient myself to the actual day and time.</p>
<p><strong>7:30 a.m.</strong><br />
I am afraid of the shower — it’s a trigger because of past experiences with my abuser — so I wash my hair and face leaning over the tub. I am ahead of schedule so I message my Talkspace therapist and pet the cats.</p>
<p><strong>1 p.m.</strong><br />
I don’t know where the time’s gone since I got to work. I dissociate and lose small amounts of time regularly. I guess I’ve been writing and editing. I feel self-conscious in my shirt — it’s too revealing with its short sleeves and V-neck. I feel safer completely covered in baggy clothing.</p>
<p><strong>3:45 p.m.</strong><br />
I’m feeling a lot of anxiety. I use the STOP skill — stop, take a step back, observe, proceed mindfully — and focus on breathing. I don’t know what’s wrong, but things feel wrong. I check on the cats just in case.</p>
<p><strong>5:25 p.m.</strong><br />
The pharmacy can’t fill my new prescription without my new insurance information. When I try to log in to register online for a temporary ID card, it says the site is down for maintenance. I hate switching insurance. I’m privileged to have health insurance, and lucky I can work. Between my salary, insurance, and support from my parents, I can afford a lot of therapy, all of which I need to keep me stable. Everybody deserves this level of care. I just got lucky.</p>
<p><strong>8:30 p.m.</strong><br />
I’m home, my head on my desk, cat curled up in my arms, my computer open. I sorted out my prescription and am facing a pile of freelance work. I hear this internal screaming and I feel the need to self-injure, but I urge surf, the technique of letting an urge build until it crests and recedes, without acting on my desire. I hear the screaming in my head, feel the distress. My foot jiggles under my desk, channeling the excess energy. I try to work a little.</p>
<p><strong>9:34 p.m.</strong><br />
Bedtime, meditation app in hands. I don’t know if I took my meds or not. I’m having a hard time calming down.</p>
<p><strong>9:43 p.m.</strong><br />
I move to the couch and pull my weighted blanket over myself, which helps calm down the nervous system, turning down the fight-or-flight response.</p>
<p><strong>10:17 p.m.</strong><br />
Move back to bed. My thoughts are racing and I still can’t sleep.</p>
<p><strong>3:40 a.m.</strong><br />
Wake up, go back to sleep.</p>
<h2>DAY 4</h2>
<p><strong>6:05 a.m.</strong><br />
Wake up, start freelance work with my cat curled up on the desk.</p>
<p>8:50 a.m.<br />
I’m at my job and writing two articles peacefully, the absorption leaving me anxiety-free for the moment.</p>
<p><strong>12 p.m.</strong><br />
I decide I should cancel the meditation class I signed up for tonight so I have more time to work. I’m really anxious, again. I take some Xanax to slow down because I am feeling out of control.</p>
<p><strong>4 p.m.</strong><br />
The Xanax makes me sleepy, so I sleep for 30 minutes during a late lunch.</p>
<h2>DAY 5</h2>
<p><strong>6:00 a.m.</strong><br />
I lost an entire night because the Xanax knocked me out. I don’t remember much about getting home yesterday and I fell asleep fully clothed on the couch with the light on. I finally wake up when my alarm goes off. I am still tired, so I hit snooze.</p>
<p><strong>7:15 a.m.</strong><br />
I have off from my full-time job today, a bonus company summer holiday, but I am still up early to work.</p>
<p><strong>9:15 a.m.</strong><br />
I’m waiting on an apartment inspection and very anxious since I have to leave for therapy soon. I can’t leave until the inspection happens because I can’t risk the cats escaping because some strangers leave my apartment door open. My cats are my lifelines, and I pathologically obsess over their safety.</p>
<p><strong>10:20 a.m.</strong><br />
The quick apartment inspection is over and I am still on time. I feel pretty good right now.</p>
<p><strong>11:30 a.m.</strong><br />
I have my second 90-min therapy session of the week. We talk about how I can make a life worth living by doing activities other than work and therapy. I’ve been avoiding anything with people and prefer to stay in my apartment with the cats as much as possible where it’s safe. Apparently this isn’t what life is supposed to be like. The more ideas we brainstorm, the more overwhelmed I feel. My therapist says fun things will help me feel better about life. I know she’s right, but I am afraid.</p>
<p><strong>1:15 p.m.</strong><br />
I stop at McDonald’s on the way to the doctor’s appointment I scheduled about losing weight. Oops?</p>
<p><strong>2:30 p.m.</strong><br />
At the doctor’s office, I hand my doctor the medical excuse form for jury duty first. I testified against my sexual abuser in several court hearings, and jury duty is a huge trigger I can’t handle right now. Just going to the court to get the medical excuse brought on panic attacks and flooded emotions and memories last week. I can’t do it. She signs my form.</p>
<p>Then we talk about the weight issue. I’ve heard most of it before, about plant-based eating and shopping around the edges of the store, and tracking what I eat. My doctor is kind, helpful, and not shaming, so I appreciate this.</p>
<p><strong>4:30 p.m.</strong><br />
Having a successful day so far, I decide to keep the momentum going — laundry. I haul the mini washing machine out of the closet, so I don’t have to go to the laundromat where there are people. I put the first load in the tiny washer, set it for 9 minutes and poke around the apartment, waiting. I hope to stuff all my laundry into just three loads. (The washing machine can only handle 11 pounds at a time.) Laundry overwhelms me and I just want to get it over with.</p>
<p><strong>7:45 p.m.</strong><br />
I survive a trip to the grocery store! I get almost everything on the list my therapist and I made. I may not care about my body — to be overweight is to be invisible and that means creepy dudes leave me alone — but all the sugar I usually eat ramps up my PTSD. My therapist didn’t mince words. I can’t get better if I don’t eat better.</p>
<p><strong>10 p.m.</strong><br />
The grocery store knocked me out and I haven’t gotten any work done. I read, take my new meds, now six pills in all, and go to sleep.</p>
<h2>DAY 6</h2>
<p><strong>6 a.m.</strong><br />
The alarm goes off. I dream my abuser is allowed to come back to school and teach like nothing happened, like he didn’t abuse a student, and nobody believes me when I say he’s dangerous. The dream makes me tired and disoriented, so I reset my alarm for later.</p>
<p><strong>6:30 a.m.</strong><br />
Alarm goes off. I reset it for later.</p>
<p><strong>8 a.m.</strong><br />
Alarm goes off. I thought it was supposed to go off earlier. I am confused and a little panicked I can’t remember why the earlier alarm didn’t go off. Even when I lose time and forget something mundane, it’s still disconcerting. What else have I missed? I get up and shower.</p>
<p><strong>8:27 a.m.</strong><br />
The work I am supposed to be doing isn’t due until midnight, so I give up, too tired to do anything now.</p>
<p><strong>9 a.m.</strong><br />
I call in to my Dialectical Behavioral Therapy skills group, which teaches mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotional regulation, and distress tolerance skills for people like me who self-injure or otherwise struggle to manage emotions. When it’s my turn to share, I talk about working on the PLEASE skill — treat physical illness, eat, avoid mood-altering substances, sleep, and exercise — with my new healthy eating mission.</p>
<p><strong>12 p.m.</strong><br />
Today marks three months exactly without self-injury. To celebrate I am getting a new tattoo, a color madala my brother designed. My tattoo artist works on my arm, covering cigarette burn scars in the process. It looks amazing when it’s done.</p>
<p><strong>3 p.m.</strong><br />
I am back home and hungry. I eat a salad but I really want sugar. I don’t feel like doing any work, so I listen to an audiobook, Carrie Fisher’s The Princess Diarist, while playing a Frozen game on my phone. It’s my favorite combination of distraction skills to keep me calm.</p>
<p><strong>7 p.m.</strong><br />
My parents call from the east coast and tell me about their dinner party. I tell them about my tattoo. They are proud of my 90 days without self-injury. So am I. We talk for over an hour.</p>
<p><strong>10 p.m.</strong><br />
I can’t really remember what I had been doing, but I am tired. I roll over on the couch and fall asleep, still dressed with the light on.</p>
<p><strong>12 a.m.</strong><br />
I wake up, think I should move to my bed or at least turn the light off but I turn over and immediately fall back asleep.</p>
<p><strong>3:26 a.m.</strong><br />
I wake up again and this time get off the couch, feed the cats, put on pajamas, and turn out the light. It crosses my mind I have forgotten to take my meds (this happens at least twice a week) but I am too tired to care. I fall back asleep.</p>
<h2>DAY 7</h2>
<p><strong>6:31 a.m.</strong><br />
Wake up again, fall back asleep.</p>
<p><strong>7:40 a.m</strong>.<br />
Wake up again, fall back asleep.</p>
<p><strong>8:31 a.m.</strong><br />
Wake up again, check my email, fall back asleep.</p>
<p><strong>9:30 a.m.</strong><br />
Decide I should stay awake to work. I will tackle my article first. I don’t know how to write the intro. I’m worried it will be terrible and I have no idea what I am doing, but I can’t avoid it forever, the deadline technically already past. I’m hungry, but I hate all the healthy food in my apartment, so I choose not to eat.</p>
<p><strong>1 p.m.</strong><br />
I’ve squeaked out a draft of the article, though it took forever and it’s way too long. I realize part of the reason writing this article is so hard is because I’m writing about dating. Any mention of dating or sex brings up unwanted memories and past fears — intimacy means unwanted sexual advances and abuse. It always triggers me.</p>
<p><strong>2 p.m.</strong><br />
I go to an individual meditation session. I tell my teacher how I’m trying to calm down my overactive fight-or-flight response while also trying to open up and express my emotions. We talk about skills that can help and decide it’s time to start a daily meditation practice. We’ll see how that goes.</p>
<p><strong>4:15 p.m.</strong><br />
I stand in line at Starbucks to get my coveted midnight mint mocha frappuccino. It’s not on the healthy eating plan, but since I skipped lunch, there is plenty of room on the calorie scale.</p>
<p><strong>4:30 p.m.</strong><br />
I Skype with my brother, sister-in-law, and young nephew. I don’t really know what to say — my life is so small and boring, so it’s a short conversation. I can’t very well talk about all my therapy or how the grocery store overwhelms me. I love seeing them though. I hope I get better at connecting and talking one of these days because I want them in my life.</p>
<p><strong>7:45 p.m.</strong><br />
I realize I should shower. I can’t muster up the courage or the energy for that, so I wash my hair and face instead. I check my email before settling in on the couch to listen to a new audiobook, Jennifer Traig’s Devil In The Details, and play Frozen.</p>
<p><strong>9 p.m.</strong><br />
I deem work finished for the day and I don’t have energy for anything else. I message my Talkspace therapist one last time, feed and water the cats, take my meds, and hop into bed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>This piece is part of our <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/tag/darkest-day/" target="_blank">Darkest Day series</a>, a collection of stories from people who’ve made it through the worst of their illness and now light the way for others.</p></blockquote>
<p>Images flash back through my mind.</p>
<p>I am locked in a dark office in the corner of another locked room during a free class period of the high school day. I&#8217;m balanced precariously on the edge of a desk with my legs wrapped around his body, the bulge in his pants gyrating in the crook between my legs. My mind wanders and eventually lands on my aching muscles, my trembling arms and legs. They&#8217;re not going to hold much longer.</p>
<p>He is standing fully clothed, his usual beat-up brown loafers planted on the floor. I smell his Cheer-washed dress shirt and Dial soap-scrubbed skin. His Docker’s are hemmed a couple inches too short. He is 43. I am 17. Those loafers rise and fall off the floor with every thrust of his crotch into me, the friction of fabric on fabric a barely noticeable sensation. All my attention focuses on my awkward position on this desk — my muscles ache and burn in protest.</p>
<p>He grinds away, oblivious in ecstasy, his face turned upwards, making those moaning sounds. Finally, my body overrides my mental willpower to stay upright and my muscles collapse. I start to fall off the desk, headed toward the floor, before he catches me and props me back on the desk.</p>
<p>Other memories follow.<span id="more-6124"></span></p>
<p>My first kiss is stolen away behind the beat-up upright piano. There&#8217;s nothing romantic about it. He pushes into my face until it hurts.</p>
<p>I am yanked out of a shower like a puppet and thrown on top of some towels on the hotel bathroom floor. His naked pelvis grinds on my back until he finishes.</p>
<p>I lie on the gray sleeping bag fully clothed while he looms overhead. With him on top of me I am suffocating. I can&#8217;t breathe.</p>
<p>Flash forward nearly 15 years.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t breathe. I sit on the edge of the tub in the bathroom, a plastic bag tight over my head. I only realize my predicament when my diaphragm starts spasming from the lack of oxygen.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t remember how I got there, on the edge of the tub, trying to suffocate myself out of existence. My mind is blank, save for getting home from work several hours earlier. It&#8217;s not a surprise I find myself in this position, nor is it unusual at this point. I don&#8217;t look forward to reporting this incident to my <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a>, again.</p>
<p>My therapist says I have PTSD, and the two therapists before her agreed. According to the <a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/ptsd-overview/basics/what-is-ptsd.asp" target="_blank">National Center for PTSD</a>, post-traumatic stress disorder includes four categories of symptoms, including reliving the event, avoiding situations that remind you of the event, having more negative beliefs in general, and feeling &#8220;keyed up.&#8221;</p>
<p>I experience all of these, and they were what got me into therapy in the first place. I can’t point to a specific moment that spurred me to action, but I know something isn’t right, that I shouldn&#8217;t feel the way I do. I am supposed to want to live. Something in me wants to survive, so despite my general hopelessness I try to find professional help. It’s either that or die, really. I cycle through 10 therapists, quitting and starting over each time, before I find one who understands what happened to me and who can really help.</p>
<p>When I start <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a> with my current therapist, I think I handle my symptoms pretty well — I hold down a job, put on a good face for friends and family, and generally keep functioning.</p>
<p>Yet this notion quickly unravels as we discover my <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxiety</a> runs sky-high. I frequently feel like nothing is real, like I live in a movie. I dissociate and there’s a lot I avoid. I self-injure away any overwhelming feelings, which is most of them. I can barely shower regularly, and I eat only french fries and cookies for lunch and dinner, respectively. I avoid people and stay in my apartment as much as possible. I don’t plan on living past 30.</p>
<p>This combination eventually lands me in the hospital at the strong urging of my therapist, a trauma recovery program that proves to be a turning point. It sets me at position “zero” on my recovery journey. This is an improvement from the constant drowning sensation of my prehospital existence.</p>
<p>Not only do I <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/recognizing-trauma-vs-ptsd-quick-primer-symptoms/" target="_blank">learn about PTSD</a> and skills to manage my mental illness, I meet other people like me at various stages of recovery. From them, I realize I want to learn to be close to people again, to feel present, to live my whole life. I want to escape the shadow of sexual abuse and the resulting PTSD.</p>
<p>Despite my general impatience, this does not happen overnight. After leaving the hospital, I still struggle with suicidality and self-injury. The problem is the anxiety and overwhelm, that feeling of being “keyed up,” or as my therapist would say, my alarm system going off all the time.</p>
<p>At the time of a traumatic event, the body and brain go into survival mode, cutting off emotions and memories automatically, without any thought on the part of the victim. These defenses are baked into the very physiology of what it means to be a living animal. That doesn’t mean the fear, sadness, pain, terror, anger, rage, or helplessness disappear, even if we can’t feel them in the moment. They’re only stored for processing when we’re safe.</p>
<p>When trauma reoccurs or isn’t fully processed after the event, PTSD is often the result. To heal, those memories frozen in temporary storage need to be moved through the body and brain to bring us back to equilibrium. It takes time to be ready to do this. In fact, most people aren’t ready until 15 to 30 years later. It’s not a small thing. This is why short statutes of limitations are cruel to victims — when they are finally ready to deal with the trauma, their recourse in court is already long over. Lucky for the offenders.</p>
<p>Many of my feelings are old, I learn, and as I begin to thaw, these will come to the surface and look like the truth. Really, they’re just echos from the past, emotions that were never felt, suspended in time until I could handle them. I have a hard time getting used to this, because they feel so real. PTSD makes it hard to tell the past from the present.</p>
<p>Eventually I am strong enough to give up suicide, and later self-injury. I commit to never putting another plastic bag over my head again. I find the courage to face the past without these old tools, trying to create new neural pathways in my brain that will steer me clear of PTSD. The progress is slow, but I start to gain traction, start to learn I can handle my emotions, that I can recover. There is maybe hope after all.</p>
<p>There’s a before trauma and an after trauma. I will never be the same person as before. My meditation teacher agrees: “No, nothing is ever the same after trauma.” She says it so simply and with so much acceptance. I want to find that much acceptance for myself, for my past, present, and future. I will never be the same person, but I potentially have my whole life ahead of me. I’ve let my abuser take up space for too long. I am not going to give him another minute.</p>
<p>As the clock ticks past the 15-year mark since the abuse started, I’m learning to appreciate how my PTSD symptoms are tied to my survival, from the dissociation, feeling unreal, extreme anxiety, and even the self-injury. This knowledge does not make recovery easier, but it helps me be a little more patient with myself when I don’t feel up to socializing like my friends do, or I have days when I am too tired to get out of bed.</p>
<p>While I have made progress, with no small thanks to my killer support team, there’s still a lot of work to do. But I look forward to the day when these old memories no longer cause a five-alarm emotional meltdown that can last days. I know my life will be mine again, my PTSD symptoms will lessen and these old stories will be just that — stories.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As with many types of traumatic or mental disorders, certain criteria must be met to receive a diagnosis. Following the structure of these guidelines is meant to allow for an accurate and unbiased determination. However, when it comes to the differentiation between Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), the question of whether men and women are diagnosed differently has been raised.</p>
<p>According to NAMI, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, <a href="https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-Conditions/Borderline-Personality-Disorder" target="_blank">an estimated 1.6% to 5.9% of adults in the U.S. have BPD</a>. And of those actually diagnosed, 75% were women, despite the fact that men are just as likely to display symptoms. A non-profit organization, PTSD United, found that roughly 8% of Americans have PTSD. Additionally, <a href="http://www.ptsdunited.org/ptsd-statistics-2/" target="_blank">1 out of 9 females</a> in the U.S. have PTSD, while the rate for males is about half that. These statistics alone call for us to question whether there is a divide in diagnosis based on gender. Before we can safely address the issue of gender, though, it’s important to look at the symptoms and characteristics that are used to diagnose both Borderline Personality Disorder and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.</p>
<p>For a mental health professional to diagnose a patient with BPD, they must display at least 5 of the <a href="https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-Conditions/Borderline-Personality-Disorder#sthash.clNofmOp.dpuf" target="_blank">qualifying symptoms</a>. These include unstable <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/relationships/" target="_blank">relationships</a> altering between idealization and devaluation, frantic efforts to avoid social abandonment, a distorted self-image that affects emotional stability, impulsive behaviors, suicidal and self-harming behavior, periods of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a>, irritability, or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxiety</a> that last between a few hours to a few days, chronic boredom or feelings of emptiness, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/anger-emotions-run-life/" target="_blank">uncontrollable anger</a>, and dissociative feelings. Most psychological research indicates the causes are genetic, environmental (from the experience of a traumatic event), neurological, or a combination of the three.<span id="more-6127"></span></p>
<p>When it comes to PTSD, an even hardier list of qualifications must be met to receive a diagnosis. There are qualifying traumatic events like death, serious injury, or sexual violence that a patient must either have experienced themselves or been a witness to. Then, there are <a href="https://psychcentral.com/lib/symptoms-and-diagnosis-of-ptsd/" target="_blank">four sets of symptom types</a>, that include a variety of symptoms: re-experiencing the event through memories, flashbacks, or nightmares; avoidance of thoughts, feelings, people, or situations connected to the traumatic event; negative alterations in mood or cognitive functions, including negative thoughts, distorted sense of blame, and feelings of detachment or isolation; and, lastly, increased arousal symptoms like difficulty concentrating, irritability, and hypervigilance. In addition, these qualifying symptoms must have lasted for at least a month. Causes of PTSD are correlated to the experience of a traumatic event, not pre-existing genetic susceptibility or neurological disorders.</p>
<p>This opens up the discussion of whether men and women are diagnosed with either BPD or PTSD differently, according to gender. While, statistically speaking, women are about twice as likely as men to meet the criteria for PTSD, the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/09/borderline-personality-disorder-impacts-relationships/" target="_blank">symptoms of BPD</a> are often looked at as stereotypically feminine behavior. For example, while men are viewed as non-emotional and prone to anger, these traits in women may seem abnormal (based on the societal construct of how each gender is supposed to act) — and women are diagnosed accordingly. Speaking to this disparity, some studies have found that doctors are <a href="https://www.borderlinepersonalitytreatment.com/borderline-personality-disorder-women.html" target="_blank">more likely to diagnose women with BPD</a>, even if a male patient is exhibiting the exact same symptoms. The male patient would, instead, be more likely to be diagnosed with PTSD, or treated for alcohol or substance abuse.</p>
<p>The theory of sexual abuse and its impact on whether a diagnosis of BPD or PTSD is given also plays a large role in addressing the gender divide. Women are more likely to both experience and report rape or sexual assault than men are. It’s perhaps this lack of reporting and willingness to seek psychological help that skews the statistics. We have <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/04/talkspace-ceo-oren-frank-on-mental-health-care-innovation-curing-the-american-nightmare/" target="_blank">society</a> to blame for this; the gender roles prescribed to males can make them feel like seeking help is a sign of weakness. Historically, soldiers who were diagnosed with PTSD were discharged from the military because of this very perception. Women are also expected to be more emotional, or “<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/history-hysteria-sexism-diagnosis/" target="_blank">hysterical</a>,” making it easy for a doctor to misdiagnose their symptoms, based solely on what is perceived as normal or acceptable behavior.</p>
<p>The types of traumatic exposure play a large role in addressing the gender divide. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/03/meet-our-therapists-a-series-nicole-amesbury/" target="_blank">Therapist Nicole Amesbury</a> said, “Gender division can be seen in PTSD and BPD in the presentation, comorbidity, and types of trauma exposure. There are differences in the type of trauma exposure that men and women experience. For example, rape carries one of the highest risks for developing PTSD and only .7% of men report rape, as opposed to 9.2% of women in the United States. Because the genders present with differing trauma — and rape occurs more to women and is underreported by men — we see societal differences in gender that create a division in diagnosis. Even whether or not someone will seek help aligns along this gendered division.”</p>
<p>Amesbury went on to say, “In addition, men and women present symptoms differently. In both PTSD and BPD men are more likely to present with irritability, impulsivity, explosive aggression and/or a comorbidity of substance abuse disorders, while women are more likely to show emotional numbing, self-harm behaviors, and/or a comorbidity of eating disorders.&#8221;</p>
<p>If men, particularly soldiers — who are just as likely to exhibit symptoms of BPD as women — are instead given the incorrect diagnosis of PTSD, the scope of treatments becomes limited.</p>
<p>Similarly, women who have PTSD and are diagnosed with BPD may not receive an effective treatment plan. This, of course, doesn’t address the fact that <a href="https://www.verywell.com/having-both-ptsd-and-borderline-personality-disorder-2797510" target="_blank">BPD and PTSD sometimes go hand in hand</a> — having one diagnosis when both are present creates a dichotomy that can leave the condition wholly untreated.</p>
<p>The importance of an accurate diagnosis not based on gender is critical. The path to getting there, however, may not be as simple.</p>
<p>First, we, as a culture, must stop using language and stereotypes that presents females as hysterical, emotional beings who are socialized toward co-dependency. We need to dismantle the stereotype that men are supposed to be strong and shouldn’t need to ask for help, as well as the notion that they don’t show their emotions (but, somehow tend toward anger more than women).</p>
<p>Second, doctors and psychiatrists must eliminate the idea of gender from their methods of diagnosis. It simply shouldn’t be a factor when there are entire criteria guidelines that can be applied, instead.</p>
<p>Diagnosis based on gender is harmful and decreases the likelihood that men and women, alike, will receive the treatment they need.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>June is PTSD Awareness Month. To participate in raising awareness and challenging the stigma of mental illness, we are publishing several pieces that show what it means to live with PTSD.</p></blockquote>
<p>Soldier&#8217;s heart. Shell shock. Combat exhaustion. Traumatic neurosis. Gross stress disorder. Combat fatigue. Rape trauma syndrome. Post Vietnam syndrome. It’s gone by many names, but post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms have been cataloged for thousands of years. In fact, descriptions of PTSD can be traced to <a href="http://traumadissociation.com/ptsd/history-of-post-traumatic-stress-disorder.html" target="_blank">ancient texts</a> such as <em>The Iliad</em> and <em>The Odyssey</em>.</p>
<p>Soldiers from nearly every war, accident victims, and survivors of natural disasters, rape, and child abuse have exhibited the classic signs of PTSD, including reliving the event, avoidance, negative beliefs, and hyperarousal.</p>
<p>To best tell PTSD’s story, World Wars I and II — and particularly the Vietnam War and Women’s Movement in the 1970s — best capture the evolution of the diagnosis, treatment, and popular perception of what is now code 309.81 in the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em>: PTSD.<span id="more-6119"></span></p>
<p>At the dawn of World War I in 1914, PTSD symptoms weren’t new. <a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/ptsd-overview/basics/history-of-ptsd-vets.asp" target="_blank">Civil War</a> soldiers had exhibited the same nightmares, panic, and psychological disruptions. The condition was termed Soldier’s heart or nostalgia, and largely seen as a weakness or character defect.</p>
<p>What did make WWI new were the industrial weaponry improvements that made war more dangerous. These war technologies included: tanks, flamethrowers, poison gas, much larger artillery rounds, and airplanes. British psychologist Charles Myers used the term “shell shock” to describe the traumatic maladies plaguing troops. The prevailing thought was soldiers’ time in trenches with large guns caused poor nerves and physiological and psychological trouble. Like the Civil War, this was chalked up to defect or poor moral character.</p>
<p>“In the view of traditionalists, a normal soldier should glory in war and betray no sign of emotion,” Judith Herman wrote in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trauma-Recovery-Aftermath-Violence-Political/dp/0465087302" target="_blank"><em>Trauma and Recovery</em></a>. “Certainly he should not succumb to terror. The soldier who developed a traumatic neurosis was at best a constitutionally inferior human being, at worst a malingerer and a coward.”</p>
<p>Treatment included harsh strategies such as shaming, threats or punishment, and electric shock therapy. As the mental health field started to expand, luckier soldiers found kinder “talking cures” to rid them of their nightmares, high-alertness, and other symptoms.</p>
<p>As soon as the war receded into the background and the Great Depression took over, shell shock retreated until the next political catalyst brought it back out of the shadows: World War II, which proved even deadlier.</p>
<p>“During the war itself, the incidence of psychological breakdown in the U.S. Army was three times that of World War I,” David J. Morris wrote in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evil-Hours-Biography-Post-Traumatic-Disorder/dp/0544570324" target="_blank"><em>The Evil Hours: A Biography of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</em></a>. “Over half a million men were permanently evacuated from the fighting for psychiatric reasons, enough to man fifty combat divisions.”</p>
<p>By now, at least one professional was ready to see soldier’s symptoms for what they were. A combination of studying World War I veterans and the beginning of World War II led American anthropologist and psychoanalyst Abram Kardiner to publish his seminal 1941 study, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Traumatic-Neuroses-War-Abram-Kardiner/dp/1614273332" target="_blank"><em>The Traumatic Neuroses of War</em></a>. In this text, Kardiner outlines what would become the basis for understanding modern-day PTSD.</p>
<p>“He believed that many of the symptoms observed in combat veterans of the First World War…could be understood as resulting from chronic arousal of the autonomic nervous system,” Herman wrote. “He also interpreted the irritability and explosively aggressive behavior of traumatized men as disorganized fragments of a shattered ‘fight or flight’ response to overwhelming danger.”</p>
<p>Kardiner may have been ahead of his time in defining what was then called traumatic war neurosis, but his work did help redefine the character of those affected by these symptoms.</p>
<p>“It was recognized for the first time that any man could break down under fire and that psychiatric casualties could be predicted in direct proportion to the severity of combat exposure,” Herman wrote.</p>
<p>Treatment options turned toward psychoanalysis but in a rapid triage format. Experts believed that emotional attachments among comrades was essential to minimizing traumatic war neurosis. Those taken off the front lines for treatment often only received a week of care before they were placed back in the line of duty so as not to be separated from their “band of brothers.”</p>
<p>Despite an improvement in perception of the disorder, returning WWII veterans were quick to shut the war out of their lives as much as they could, a situation the public was all too happy to enable.</p>
<p>“It was a different culture that they came back to,” Andrew Pomerantz, chief of mental health services for the Veteran’s Association in Vermont <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/heart/interviews/pomerantz.html" target="_blank">told PBS</a>. “It was a culture of&#8230;‘We won the war; we&#8217;re really great.’&#8230;When I ask them one of my standard questions — ‘Have you ever talked with your family about what happened?’ — the answer is almost invariably no. Almost to a person, it&#8217;s always ‘No, I haven&#8217;t.’”</p>
<p>Soldiers may have tried to bury their wartime experiences and difficulties, but traumatic war neurosis didn’t go away.</p>
<p>“One such study, published in the <em>American Journal of Psychiatry</em> in 1951, examined two hundred World War II veterans and found that 10 percent of them still suffered from ‘combat neurosis,’” Morris wrote. “Evidence indicates that many World War II veterans were unable to put the war behind them.”</p>
<p>These statistics didn’t go unnoticed. A diagnosis called gross stress reaction made it into the first edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s <em>DSM-I</em>. This was <a href="http://www.brainline.org/content/2011/01/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-a-history-and-a-critique_pageall.html" target="_blank">defined</a> as “a stress syndrome that is a response to an exceptional physical or mental stress, such as a natural catastrophe or battle; it occurs in people who are otherwise normal.”</p>
<p>And then came the turning point, the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>“I think it&#8217;s fair to say that the Vietnam veterans and the fact that&#8230;the Vietnam veterans&#8217; advocacy groups were so politically active, were very important in getting PTSD defined,” Thomas Burke, director of mental health policy for the U.S. Department of Defense <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/heart/interviews/burke.html" target="_blank">told PBS</a>. “It was pressure from the Vietnam veterans&#8217; advocacy groups that really pushed the mental health community into defining PTSD.”</p>
<p>This started when Vietnam Veterans Against the War organized “rap groups” to discuss their difficulty in returning to civilian life and the terrible symptoms they experienced from “combat fatigue.” By the mid 1970s, there were hundreds of rap groups around the country. They defined their plight as Post Vietnam syndrome and put it on the political map.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, feminists participated in consciousness-raising groups, which created a forum to discuss their own traumas, such as rape and child abuse. Like the VVAW, the consciousness-raising groups were both therapeutic and political. Out of the Women’s Movement came a call for rape centers (the first opened in 1971) and re-defining rape as a violent crime rather than a sex act.</p>
<p>In 1974, researchers Ann Burgess and Lynda Holmstrom conducted one of the first studies on rape. Their findings matched what soldiers had experienced for generations.</p>
<p>“They noticed a pattern of postrape symptoms: sleeplessness, paranoia, an exaggerated startle response, nightmares, and a host of phobias related to circumstances of their attack,” Morris wrote. “[They] decided to call this phenomenon ‘rape trauma syndrome,’ [and] noted that the same symptoms they had observed had been described 30 years before in survivors of war.”</p>
<p>The result of these two political movements converging led to significant rallying power, so much so that the official diagnosis of “post-traumatic stress disorder” was added to the DSM-III in 1980. Finally trauma survivors had an official diagnosis and the validation they deserve.</p>
<p>As the definition of PTSD has evolved, so have therapeutic techniques across the VA, clinics, and individual therapists. The most popular treatments address both the physical and mental symptoms of PTSD. This includes modalities from behavioral therapy to sensorimotor processing to prolonged exposure therapy and many more.</p>
<p>Public perception, too, has moved toward accepting survivors, from soldiers returning from combat in recent years, to survivors of natural disasters or terrorist attacks, and those who have escaped rape and abuse.</p>
<p>With the validation of an official diagnosis, growing knowledge-base from the mental health community, and increased awareness and compassion from the public, maybe true healing for all generations of people can now begin.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When American soldiers came home from the Vietnam War, <a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/ptsd-overview/basics/history-of-ptsd-vets.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">many found it hard to return to normal life</a>. They were haunted by nightmares; unable to shake the images of explosions and death from their minds, even while awake. They struggled with feelings of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxiety</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a>, and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/anger-emotions-run-life/" target="_blank">anger</a>; confused about how to to make sense of what they had witnessed. In 1980, the afflictions of these soldiers — along with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181836/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">research on the psychological impact of trauma</a> on Holocaust survivors, rape victims, and others — led the American Psychiatric Association to define a new condition called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in the DSM.</p>
<p>Although people often associate PTSD with veterans affected by the horrors of war, the condition can develop in anyone who has experienced a dangerous, shocking, or life-threatening event such as rape, childhood abuse, or a serious accident. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, PTSD will affect <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/prevalence/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-among-adults.shtml" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">6.8%</a> of U.S. adults in their lifetime. The condition is defined by symptoms like <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/anxiety-attack-vs-panic-attack-one/" target="_blank">panic attacks</a>, depression, and insomnia, but one of the most characteristic and debilitating symptoms of PTSD is something called “flashbacks.”<span id="more-6113"></span></p>
<p>Flashbacks are like waking nightmares. They are intense, repeated episodes of re-living the traumatic experience while you’re fully awake. Flashbacks can come on suddenly and feel uncontrollable. They are more like a nightmare than a memory because sufferers often cannot distinguish between the flashback and reality, feeling like the traumatic experience is happening again, in the moment. Flashbacks are vivid, sensory experiences. During one, a sufferer might see, hear, and smell things they saw, heard and smelled during the traumatic moment.</p>
<p>How can flashbacks be such an all consuming, visceral experience? How can they transport you back to the traumatic experience almost instantly? To understand that, we’ll explain what’s happening in your brain when a flashback occurs.</p>
<h2>The Impact of Traumatic Events on Memory</h2>
<p>To understand what happens in your brain during a flashback, you first need to understand how memories are formed and how trauma disrupts the way this process normally works.</p>
<h3>What Happens to Different Parts of the Brain</h3>
<p>Memory is a complex process that involves many parts of your brain, but to keep it simple, we’ll focus on two of the key players: the amygdala and the hippocampus. The amygdala is associated with emotional memory — especially the formation of fear-related memories. It evolved to ensure your survival by strongly encoding memories of past dangers you’ve experienced so that you recognize and respond to those threats if you see them again.</p>
<p>The hippocampus, the other region of your brain heavily involved in memory, acts like the brain’s historian. It catalogs all the different details of an experience like who was there, where it happened, and what time of day it was into one cohesive event you can consciously recollect as a memory. In your typical, day-to-day life, your amygdala and hippocampus work together to turn your experiences into distinct long-term memories.</p>
<p>However, during a traumatic event this system works a bit differently. Because you are in danger, your body’s built in fight-or-flight mechanism takes over and your amygdala is overactivated while the hippocampus is suppressed. From an evolutionary perspective, this makes sense: the processes involved in building a cohesive memory are de-prioritized in favor of paying attention to the immediate danger. As a result, your memory becomes jumbled.</p>
<h3>After the Threat has Passed</h3>
<p>When the threat has passed, you are left with a strong, negative emotional memory of the experience, but you lack clear recollection of the context of the event. In other words, you may learn to associate individual sights, smells, and sounds from the event with danger, but be unable to recall the sequence of events clearly.</p>
<p>Later on, if you encounter things that remind you of the traumatic event, like a smell that was present when it happened, your amygdala will retrieve that memory and respond strongly — signaling that you are in danger and automatically activating your fight-or-flight system. This is why during a flashback, you start sweating, your heart races, and you breath heavily — your amygdala has set off a chain reaction to prepare your body to respond against a threat.</p>
<p>Normally when your amygdala senses a possible threat, your hippocampus will then kick in to bring in context from past memories to determine whether or not you are really in danger. But because the hippocampus wasn’t functioning properly during the traumatic experience, the context of the memory wasn’t stored, and there’s no feedback system to tell your amygdala this situation is different and you’re not in danger. Also, since the memory is retrieved without context like where or when the experience happened, you might even feel like the traumatic experience is happening again.</p>
<h2>Therapy Can Help You Overcome Flashbacks</h2>
<p>Understanding what’s happening in your brain during a PTSD flashback can help you learn strategies to cope. You can <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_BOTTOM&amp;utr_adgroup=bottom-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=6113" target="_blank">work with a therapist</a> to identify triggers for your flashbacks, such as certain objects, people, or places. Then, you can work with them to identify ways to respond calmly to these triggers through relaxation techniques as well as cognitive and exposure therapies.</p>
<p>While PTSD can be a debilitating condition — in some cases taking years for the survivor to be stable and healthy enough to process the trauma — with appropriate treatment it can be successfully overcome.</p>
