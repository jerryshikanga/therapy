				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2016 was not the best year for most people I know, myself included. One of the few good things that’s happened this year is that — after years of convincing myself not to — I finally made a commitment to see a therapist.</p>
<p>After some discussions with my therapist, I decided to avoid making concrete New Years resolutions I can’t keep. No, I’m not going to cut cheese from my diet. I’m most likely not going to make full use of that gym membership I’ve been eyeing.</p>
<p>And that’s OK. Struggling for perfection is stifling and utterly exhausting.</p>
<p>Instead I decided to focus on mental health resolutions I can actually keep. I’m hoping they will make 2017 a happier and less stressful year.<span id="more-5274"></span></p>
<h2>Resolution #1: Being OK With Crying</h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5276 alignright" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/crying-secondary_JR.jpg" alt="Dawson crying meme" width="451" height="340" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/crying-secondary_JR.jpg 451w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/crying-secondary_JR-300x226.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" /></p>
<p>In 2016 I came to terms with the fact that I’m a lot more empathetic than the average person. I cry— a lot. I cried during the Hunger Games trailer. I usually lie and exclaim, “I just have something in my contacts.”</p>
<p>But really I’m crying a little bit. Sometimes I get overwhelmed by the all the beauty and sadness in this world, and that’s all right.</p>
<h2>Resolution #2: Building Boundaries</h2>
<p>2017 will be about building boundaries. I want to be able to say no without dwelling upon it for hours after, wondering if that response was acceptable. When the emotional energy of a person or situation is impacting me negatively, I want to be able to change the subject or walk away without thinking I’ve abandoned someone.</p>
<p>These habits of mine have painted me as a loyal and understanding person. At the same time they have contributed to debilitating emotional fatigue.</p>
<h2>Resolution #3: Savoring My ‘Me Time’</h2>
<figure id="attachment_3416" style="width: 413px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-3416 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/liz-lemon-couch_275H_JR.jpg" alt="Liz Lemon couch doing nothing" width="413" height="275" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/liz-lemon-couch_275H_JR.jpg 413w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/liz-lemon-couch_275H_JR-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">It&#8217;s OK to have me time&#8230;and cheese time!</figcaption></figure>
<p>In 2017 I will savor the moments I keep for myself. I will take more baths, spend my solitary nights guilt-free. I will try to live more shamelessly.</p>
<p>I should really cut cheese out of my diet, but I’ll do that when I’m ready. I accept my sensitivity, and will try to make it serve me as much as it has served others.</p>
<p>Maybe there are some similar mental health resolutions you can make. If so, feel free to tweet them at us <a href="https://twitter.com/talkspace" target="_blank">@Talkspace</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s to a fruitful 2017!</p>
