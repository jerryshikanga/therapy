				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being a teenager’s rough. You’ve gotta juggle homework, extracurricular activities, friends, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/6-quick-tips-to-maintain-your-mental-health-while-dating/">dating</a>&#8230;and not to mention, you’re probably pretty busy maintaining your image on Instagram. It’s totally normal to feel stressed out, angsty, or sad sometimes. But it’s important to be able to check in and ask yourself — is this run of the mill teenage <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/stress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stress</a>, or is it something else?<span id="more-11390"></span></p>
<h2>You&#8217;re Not Alone</h2>
<p>Having some sort of mental health condition as a teen is more common than you think. You might feel like you’re the only one in your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/college-students-guide-mental-health-wish-knew/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">school</a> going through what you’re going through, but I promise, you’re not! Twenty percent of teens ages 13-18 have a mental health condition. If you’re not great with percentages (which, I’m not) let me break it down this way. This means <a href="https://www.nami.org/NAMI/media/NAMI-Media/Infographics/Children-MH-Facts-NAMI.pdf“" target="”_blank”">1 in 5 teens has a mental health condition</a>. So if your math class has 20 kids in it, the odds are that 4 of them are battling a mental health condition, diagnosed or not.</p>
<p>When facing mental health struggles, it can be hard to find someone who you feel really understands you. Chances are, the other kids who are struggling aren’t talking about it because they’re scared of being judged. Unfortunately, there’s such a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/09/the-stigma-of-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stigma</a> attached to mental illness, in both teens and adults, that many people are scared to speak up or ask for help when they think they might have a mental health problem. This is probably the reason why some people wait a whopping <a href="https://www.nami.org/NAMI/media/NAMI-Media/Infographics/Children-MH-Facts-NAMI.pdf“" target="”_blank”">8-10 years</a> (!!!!) to get help after experiencing their first mental illness symptoms. Let’s change that.</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s Okay to Seek Help From a Counselor</h2>
<p>It’s great to have friends to talk to about the things you deal with, but when you’re dealing with something a little heavier than general stress or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/sadness-or-depression-how-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sadness</a>, it’s best to turn to a professional. Even if you’re not sure if what you’re going through is something that could be a mental health condition, it’s best to chat with a professional to be sure. In the long run, you’ll be glad you did. Plus, sometimes you really just need someone to talk to who <i>isn’t </i>a friend or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/counselors-guide-talking-friends-family-about-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">family</a> member–and that’s where therapy comes in!</p>
<p>I know, I know. You probably think <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">therapy</a> is just for “crazy people.” First of all&#8230;let’s erase that word from our vocabulary. People with mental illnesses are not <em>crazy</em>. And if you are dealing with a mental health condition, you are NOT crazy. Don’t let anybody tell you otherwise.</p>
<p>You may have the stereotypical image in your head of therapy from TV or movies&#8230;like somebody lying on a couch crying while the “shrink” asks, “And how does that make you <i>feeeeel?” </i>Sure, maybe therapy is like that <i>sometimes, </i>but it definitely isn’t always (and it’s definitely not with Talkspace). Also, you don’t need to have a mental health condition to go to therapy. Like I said, sometimes you just need an outside source to talk to.</p>
<h2>You Can Talk About Anything</h2>
<p>In therapy you can talk about literally <em>anything — </em>from school stress to dating stress&#8230;like the fact that your crush keeps leaving you on read (ugh!). Your parents have probably said to you, “Honey, you can talk to us about <i>anything!” </i>But let’s be real. You probably don’t want to talk to your parents about stuff like <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/6-ways-sex-is-good-for-your-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sex</a> *shudder* or even about the pressure that <i>they’re </i>putting on you to do well in school or get into an Ivy League.</p>
<p>With a counselor or therapist, you really <i>can </i>talk about anything without feeling awkward or guilty. Trust me, they’ve heard it all. And hey, they’ve probably been through some of the same things that you’re going through right now! At the very least, they’ve definitely been through that dreaded <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/09/things-wish-i-told-my-anxious-college-self/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">college</a> app process.</p>
<p>With a counselor, you don’t have to worry about hiding who you really are or what you’re feeling. You don’t have to worry about sounding silly or “dumb” or embarrassed. counselors won’t judge you&#8230;and trust me, they’ve really heard <i>everything. </i></p>
<p>Plus, you know your secrets are safe with them. Counselors aren’t going to start a rumor about you that the whole school will know. You also don’t have to worry about your counselor spilling your secrets to your parents. In fact, in most states, counselors aren’t allowed to share confidential information from your therapy sessions with your parents unless you’ve signed a release — or in extreme cases, if your life is at risk. Even though as a minor, a parent or guardian has to consent to your treatment, YOU have to consent to them knowing what you talk about to your counselor.</p>
<h2>Online Therapy is Built For People Like You</h2>
<p>Since you’re already on your phone all the time, using Talkspace is extra convenient. You can leave a text or audio message for your counselor anytime, anywhere. Plus, anyone who sees you on your phone will have no idea that you’re texting your counselor!</p>
<p>With Talkspace, your phone becomes a safe space. You can send a message and feel a little better instantly, getting something off your chest, knowing you’ll have awesome advice from your counselor soon. Your counselor will listen to you no matter what, and you’ll know you always have someone who cares and is looking out for your wellbeing.</p>
<h2>Next Steps if You Need Help</h2>
<p>So, if you’re a teen dealing with a mental health condition, remember these things:</p>
<ol>
<li>You are not alone.</li>
<li>Help is readily available.</li>
<li>Having a mental health condition and speaking to a counselor is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of.</li>
</ol>
<p>And hey, if you’ve read this whole article, you’re already a step ahead in your mental health journey. Keep going.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Is this normal?”</p>
<p>As a therapist who works with children and teens, I hear this question frequently. Adolescents go through changes in such a short period, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/steps-adolescents-can-take-reduce-chronic-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teens</a> (and parents) may wonder if they’re losing their grip.<span id="more-11377"></span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, many teens don’t share these thoughts with their <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/online-therapy-is-a-godsend-for-busy-parents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parents</a>. This, however, can have long-term consequences, so it’s important we don’t ignore our teen’s mental health and the potential long-term suffering associated. Consider these facts from the <a href="https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-By-the-Numbers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">National Alliance on Mental Illness</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>About 1 in 5 people between ages 13 and 18 experience a severe mental disorder</li>
<li>Half of all long-term mental illness begins by age 14</li>
<li>Suicide is the 3rd leading cause of death for people age 10-14, 2nd for those aged 15-24</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Teen’s Changing Brain</h2>
<p>People assume puberty (and its surrounding awkwardness) is the only thing teens worry about. They often ignore the biggest influencer of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/control-emotions-cognitive-behavioral-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mood</a> and mental health — the brain.</p>
<p>As a teen’s body grows, so does their brain. During development it often changes in new, confusing ways — for both the teen and their parent. In early adolescence, teens tend to think in black-or-white, paying most attention to what’s immediately in front of them.</p>
<p>Later, when they’re a little older and their brain has finished developing, they may notice connections they hadn’t previously. Their thoughts turn toward the future and who they’d like to become. Friends become more important. They build their own values, often very different from those of parents or teachers.</p>
<p>In addition, some areas of the brain develop faster than others. Teenagers are just beginning to think about long-term consequences, even as they’re making sometimes confounding and impulsive decisions.</p>
<p>For example, your child may be determined to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/09/lower-high-expectations-in-college/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">graduate</a> on time, but choose to watch YouTube instead of studying for big tests. The unevenness of this development can lead to frustration from those who care most about their future — i.e., parents, guardians, and teachers.</p>
<h2>Common Teen Mental Health Problems</h2>
<p>Hormones present during puberty combine with these new ways of thinking, sometimes causing chaos in adolescent thought patterns. In addition to genetics and environmental factors, this is one reason why teens are at risk for numerous mental health or behavioral problems, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/eating-disorders-body-image/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eating Disorders</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anxiety</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Depression</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/addiction-mental-illness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Substance Abuse</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/time-retire-self-harm-alternatives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Violence/Self-harm</a></li>
<li>Legal Problems</li>
<li><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/how-to-deal-with-multiple-mental-illnesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Psychotic Disorders</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These changes are enough to make <i>anyone</i> feel a little unstable, so it’s important to pinpoint the difference between normal teenage stress and more serious problems.</p>
<h2>Fear of Getting Help</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.nccp.org/publications/pub_878.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">National Center for Children in Poverty</a>, up to a third of teens with mental illness don’t get the help they need. Why?</p>
<p>Aside from the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/stigma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stigma</a> mental illness carries, many teens worry about who will find out about their problems if they get help. They often don’t want parents or friends to know. Although teens sometimes underestimate their parents’ ability to help them work through their issues, many do in fact need help from an unbiased counselor outside the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/therapists-guide-talking-friends-family-about-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">family</a>. Additionally, while parents or guardians may feel a sense of shame that their teen needs help — that they’ve failed in some ways as a parent — this is most often not the case. Mental health conditions do not discriminate and struggle is not indicative of moral failure. The important thing is getting them help.</p>
<p>Depending on state of residence, teens can sometimes get mental health treatment without their parents’ permission. In most states (each state is different and there are exceptions) their counsellor will keep issues confidential — unless they’re a danger to themselves or others. Teen safety is the number one priority for counselor and mental health professionals and it’s important that you give your teen the space to work out issues that may feel too close or too uncomfortable to discuss with a close family member.</p>
<p><a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/talkspace-for-teens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Talkspace for Teens</a> requires a parent or guardian’s consent, but the process is streamlined so that your teen should be able to receive the care of a licensed counselor within just a few hours of signing up. Talkspace for Teens also employs banking-grade security to ensure your teen’s security. And rest assured, all of the 3,000+ counselors are experienced, licensed mental health professionals who have been through Talkspace’s rigorous vetting, credentialing, and onboarding process.</p>
<h2>Warning Signs</h2>
<p>Regardless of the rules in your state, pay attention to the following warning signs, which may signal you should seek help for your teen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their symptoms distract them in many settings — struggles are on their mind no matter what they do.</li>
<li>Grades or job performance get worse and stay that way over weeks or months.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Relationships</a> suffer. They can’t get along with loved ones or they isolate themself.</li>
<li>Their moods feel out of control. Their usual coping strategies — the ways they deal with issues — no longer help to control their anger, worry, or sadness.</li>
<li>They take more risks. Exploring new things, including <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/alcohol-abuse-signs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alcohol</a>, drugs, or sex, is mostly common, but behavior that puts them or others in danger should be a warning sign.</li>
<li>They often think about hurting themselves or others. Many teens experience such thoughts occasionally, but they need immediate help if they can’t control them or they want to act on them.</li>
<li>They hear or see things others can’t, or their thinking gets confused or paranoid. Although rare, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, or fear that others are trying to harm them can be signs of a serious medical problem.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mental Health Resources for Teens</h2>
<p>Parents or guardians usually understand and care more than kids think, but in some cases, parents might not be the only resource they need. It’s important for them to talk to family members they trust, but if they don’t feel comfortable doing so, there are options:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a> Available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with text option.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nami.org/Find-Support" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">National Alliance on Mental Illness Help Line</a> Also available 24/7 with text option.</li>
<li><a href="https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">SAMHSA Behavioral Health Services Locator</a> Finds providers in your area; offers a 24/7 hotline.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.settogo.org/for-students/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Set to Go</a> Intended for people moving to college, but includes mental health information helpful to all teens.</li>
<li>School resources. Guidance counselors or school nurses may be able to talk with you confidentially at school, or tell you about other options near you.</li>
<li>Your doctor’s office. Many doctors have someone on call to answer questions. You can call anonymously, ask if they see teens without parental consent, or ask for local provider names.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/talkspace-for-teens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Talkspace for Teens</a> is also an inexpensive, convenient way to access behavioral health care. Teens can send unlimited text, video, picture, and audio messages to their counselor from an app on their phone or from a web browser — anytime, anywhere. There’s no need to schedule appointments or commute to an office, and they won’t have to miss school or activities.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://research.talkspace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent study of Talkspace users</a> showed that 93% of participants reported improvement on their toughest problems in as little as 2 months and 90% said they preferred Talkspace to traditional counseling. In addition to the effectiveness and convenience, Talkspace for Teens is also about 80% more affordable than brick-and-mortar counseling.</p>
<p>Stress is normal throughout adolescence, but it’s important to get your teen help if they’re struggling. Just like homework, a job, or college taking care of one’s mental health now is a great investment in the future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you keep secrets from your family?</p>
<p>If you’re mentally rifling through all the skeletons in your family closet, you’re definitely not alone. Even those who pride themselves on openness probably have a secret or two that they’re not willing to share — even with the people they hold most dear. From issues as traumatic as sexual violence, to those as relatively mild (but still potentially contentious) as who we vote for, most of us have secrets we’d rather not share with our families.<span id="more-11341"></span></p>
<p>Keeping certain things to ourselves can be a normal and healthy aspect of privacy. But more serious secrets — those that are motivated by <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/when-you-feel-trapped-in-a-shame-spiral-try-this/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shame</a>, or that could potentially impact a family member’s wellbeing — can haunt families for years and disrupt healthy familial bonds.</p>
<p>But how can we tell the difference between healthy privacy and harmful secret keeping? And if we do choose to open up about tough subjects, how can we preserve our family relationships — if it’s healthy to preserve them at all?</p>
<p>I caught up with Rachel O’Neill, Ph.D., an Ohio-licensed professional clinical counselor and Talkspace therapist, for a conversation about why families keep secrets, and how to talk about the things we’d rather keep secret.</p>
<h2>Why Do Our Loved Ones Keep Secrets?</h2>
<p>“Every family is different, but I think in general families tend to keep secrets around things that they have some sort of shame associated with,” says Dr. O’Neill. Besides shame, family members can be motivated to keep secrets if they fear that revealing something would upset the family equilibrium or have implications in the broader community.</p>
<p>Some common secrets Dr. O’Neill sees in her practice include <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/identity-and-expression-what-does-gender-got-to-do-with-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gender and sexual identity</a>; physical, sexual, or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/addiction-mental-illness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">substance abuse</a>; or even an unpopular political opinion (something Dr. O’Neill says she’s seeing families hide more often in the current political climate). In the wake of the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/10/one-year-after-metoo-movement/" target="”_blank”">#MeToo movement</a>, Dr. O’Neill also says she’s heard from a number of people who have been inspired to open up about sexual violence they previously kept secret.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, secret keeping isn’t motivated by shame but rather, by the desire to protect someone. This often takes the form of a parent or caregiver trying to protect a child from information they think would be too painful. However, says Dr. O’Neill, this desire to protect can sometimes backfire.</p>
<p>“Oftentimes <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/childrens-mental-health-worry-take-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parents and caregivers</a> tend to try to do what they think is in the best interest of a person, of their child, and I think sometimes that is misguided,” she says, citing examples of parents not telling children they were adopted or not being open with children about the death of a loved one.</p>
<p>In these situations, Dr. O’Neill advises that honesty is the best policy. “The more honest we can become in these family relationships the more we can decrease the long-held stigma and the shame associated with these kinds of secrets.”</p>
<h2>Healthy Privacy vs. Harmful Secret Keeping</h2>
<p>Not all secret keeping is unhealthy, however. After all, we all have parts of ourselves that we don’t wish to share with anyone else, or parts of ourselves we reserve for spaces outside the family — whether that be the exact details of our <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/11/voting-mental-health-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting</a> records or of our sexual escapades.</p>
<p>“When I hear ‘keeping a secret,’ to me there’s that aspect of wanting to rid oneself of it, that idea of keeping this as a burden,” Dr. O’Neill says. On the other hand, she defines privacy as an active choice that the person is okay with. With privacy, says Dr. O’Neill, a person feels “a level of comfort with having decided to not share this information.”</p>
<p>Research backs up this distinction. A recent study found that the psychologically stressful part of secret keeping isn’t actual the act of lying about your secret. Instead, it’s the stress of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/05/shhhhh/526581/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">thinking about</a> the secret so much, and therefore feeling inauthentic. It stands to reason, then, that people who feel comfortable with their secret may obsess about it less.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are some secrets that definitely shouldn’t be kept. If your secret could negatively impact someone else’s health and safety, it’s important that you come forward. Pressuring someone else to keep quiet about potentially harmful issues is also a major no-no.</p>
<p>According to Dr. O’Neill, this kind of enforced secret keeping unfortunately often occurs around instances of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/10/types-of-domestic-violence-signs-what-you-can-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">family violence</a> and substance abuse.</p>
<p>“It becomes this network of secret keeping,” she says. “There’s the perpetrator, the person who’s perpetrating the abuse or the substance abuse and there’s those individuals around them who are intent on keeping that information a secret.” This becomes an abusive pattern in which survivors are made to, in Dr. O’Neill’s words, “suffer in silence.”</p>
<p>This is reflected in the statistics about sexual violence. According the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN), 2 out of 3 sexual assaults go unreported to the police. Among survivors who didn’t report, <a href="https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">7% said</a> they didn’t want the perpetrator to get in trouble. And overwhelmingly, perpetrators are close to victims, with <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/sexual-assault-victims/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">33% of rape victims</a> assaulted by an intimate partner and <a href="https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">34% of the people who abuse children</a> are their family members.</p>
<h2>The Courage to Open Up</h2>
<p>“We tend to make changes in our life when we become uncomfortable with something,” says Dr. O’Neill. She says that people often choose to reveal family secrets when an outside event inspires the revelation, or when it simply becomes too burdensome to keep the secret inside.</p>
<p>This makes sense, considering that secrets can feel like an actual, physical burden. One <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22390267" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">2012 study</a> found that people who were preoccupied with secrets perceived hills to be steeper, distances farther, and physical tasks more onerous than those without secrets. The more we think about secrets, the study found, the heavier they seem. That’s why opening up about the secrets that are weighing on us can feel like a literal unburdening.</p>
<h2>The Discomfort of Revealing Family Secrets</h2>
<p>When family secrets are revealed, however, this sense of unburdening can also be accompanied by serious discomfort, as truths we assumed about the people we’re close to change rapidly. In the wake of such revelations, Dr. O’Neill says, the path to healing depends on what the family members’ previous <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relationships</a> were like, as well as the nature of the secret.</p>
<p>In situations where the family members have an otherwise good relationship and the secret, though potentially discomfiting, was kept with the best of intentions — for example, an otherwise loving family keeping the real cause of a family member’s death secret with the intention of protecting a child — there is potential for the family members to work through the issues and heal.</p>
<p>In contrast, when the family relationship was already strained or the secret was harmful, like physical or sexual abuse, healing can be much more fraught.</p>
<p>Dr. O’Neill says that it’s best to tailor responses to what impacted individuals want. In cases of violence and abuse, she says, one of the most important things is to remember that the survivor is never responsible for what happened to them and should not have to take on the burden of coming forward if they don’t want to.</p>
<p>“My goal with working with folks is always to help foster a sense of acceptance around what has happened in the past,” she says. “If you choose never to come forward, you’re not responsible for this person continuing to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/is-it-a-normal-fight-or-verbal-abuse-heres-how-to-tell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abuse</a>, that’s just simply not fair for a survivor to have to bear that burden.”</p>
<p>Sometimes, healing can best occur by taking the person who offended out of the picture entirely, i.e., removing them from your life. In any case, O’Neill says it’s most important to first prioritize the needs of the survivor and then, if they wish, engage with the family unit.</p>
<h2>Healing Relationships</h2>
<p>While it’s definitely possible to heal individually <i>and</i> as a family after the revelation of a disruptive secret, it’s best to establish an atmosphere of healthy honesty in the family from the beginning.</p>
<p>Many issues that were once stigmatized, like adoption, divorce, and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/07/mental-health-problems-bisexual-men-and-women-deal-with/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LGBT sexuality</a>, are becoming increasingly accepted. Talking about these issues with openness and honesty right off the bat helps affirm to all family members that their experiences aren’t shameful, but are normal and valued.</p>
<p>In these situations, honesty is a form of love. When it comes to preventing abuse, experts advise being open about healthy sexuality and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/parenting/wp/2015/02/13/its-never-too-early-to-teach-children-about-consent-and-boundaries/?utm_term=.809b5456ebdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">teaching children healthy boundaries</a> beginning from early childhood.</p>
<p>By cultivating honesty within families, we can prevent issues from happening or deal with them in a healthy manner when they do arise. Of course, if you do still choose to keep some things within the bounds of healthy privacy, we promise we won’t tell grandma about your new boyfriend.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One in five adults live with mental illness, so it stands to reason that there are many children out there who are raised by parents who battle mental illness. Mental illness encompasses many disorders — from bipolar disorder to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/dealing-depression-need-know/">depression</a> — and range in severity from mild to severe.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that there are many brave, strong parents who are in treatment for their mental illness and can parent their children with stability and love. But this is not always the case. Children who are raised by parents with untreated or severe mental illness are going to feel the effects, whether they are aware of what’s happening at the time or not.</p>
<p><span id="more-11205"></span></p>
<h2>Effects of Parental Mental Illness on Kids</h2>
<p>Growing up with a parent who is mentally ill “can lead to a child feeling uncertain, anxious, and neglected,” says Talkspace therapist Kimberly Leitch, LCSW-R. Life can be unstable and unpredictable, and children may not learn proper coping skills. “Instead of adapting healthy coping skills they can learn early on negative coping skills through observation,” Leitch explains.</p>
<p>What’s more, many parents who are mentally ill self-medicate — perhaps <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/addiction-mental-illness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turning to drugs or alcohol</a> to quell their symptoms. This is a maladaptive behavior that can be passed along to a child.</p>
<p>Children can develop <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/different-types-anxiety-disorders-classified/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety disorders</a> based on the frightening ways that their parent behaves, often without having a way to process this behavior. Leitch gives the example of a parent who suffers with bipolar disorder and experiences manic episodes.</p>
<p>“A child won’t always understand that it is not normal behavior,” says Leitch, adding that the same idea stands for depressive episodes and behaviors. “They will not necessarily understand that this is what happens when their parent is sick, this is how their parent is,” she explains.</p>
<h2>Normalization of Irregular Behavior in a Child’s Eyes</h2>
<p>Part of what makes growing up this way so challenging is that most children aren’t aware that their parent is mentally ill. They believe that the way they live and are parented is completely normal.</p>
<p>“A child who gets read to and tucked in every night by their parent most likely assumes that every child experiences that because that is their norm,” Leitch says. “Having a mentally ill parent can lead to social rejection, social issues, and dissolution of the family, but a child may not be aware that the parent is the cause.”</p>
<p>To cope, many children end up becoming the caretakers of their parents — unaware that they are being tasked with something that is beyond what should be expected of a child. This can lead to feelings of abandonment, isolation, trust issues, and low self-esteem, Leitch describes.</p>
<h2>How Resilience Allows Children to Lead a Normal Life</h2>
<p>However, there may be silver lining to all of this. Although recovering from being raised by a mentally ill parent can be extremely difficult, it <i>is</i> possible. Many children grow up to be resilient adults who are able to rise above the pain that ensued during childhood.</p>
<p>In her<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13668803.2015.1117418?journalCode=ccwf20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> research</a>, Lynne McCormack, a psychologist from the University of Newcastle, Australia, found that there are three attributes that recovering adults who have been raised by mentally ill parents exhibit: “unexpected growth in empathy and compassion, high resourcefulness, and personal authenticity through higher education.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, as McMormack explains, her findings show that it is possible to positively redefine your identity even after enduring the trauma tied to living with a parent who is mentally ill.</p>
<p>To get that place takes self-awareness, self-love, and acknowledgment and acceptance of your parent as a person who is mentally ill. In some cases, you may have <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/09/pass-mental-illness-to-kids-children/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">inherited your parent’s mental illness</a> either genetically (bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have a genetic link, says Leitch) or through learned behavior from childhood. Getting treated for that – and understanding it within the context of your upbringing – is vital.</p>
<h2>Processing Parental Mental Illness as an Adult</h2>
<p>Most adults benefit greatly from <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/free-online-therapy-versus-paid-counseling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having a trusted therapist</a> who can help them process their childhood, and understand clearly how it has affected them. Since growing up with a mentally ill parent can be traumatic, it is often recommended that you find a therapist who specializes is overcoming trauma.</p>
<p>The road ahead will be bumpy, but it <i>is</i> possible to forge a path ahead that is not defined by the traumas of your upbringing, but rather by a new, healthy, happy life that you define for yourself.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you think of therapy, a stereotypical scenario comes to mind: A person lying on a dusty leather couch while some guy with a small notepad sits somewhere by their head, or perhaps across from them, jotting down insights as they speak, probably about their twisted relationship with their parents.</p>
<p>There’s some truth to this scenario (the couch does always seem to be leather, no?), and while talking about your childhood it isn’t the case for all therapy interactions, it is for reparenting.<br />
<span id="more-10905"></span></p>
<h2>Reparenting Defined</h2>
<p>Reparenting — also called ‘limited reparenting’ — is when a psychotherapist takes the role of a concerned and trustworthy parent so the client can learn what a trusting relationship is like.</p>
<p>“Reparenting helps an individual repair attachments and develop more secure and healthy relationships,” said Rachel O’Neill, an Ohio-licensed professional counselor and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/join-as-a-therapist" target="_blank">Talkspace therapist</a>. “It can help an individual recognize and repair patterns of non-functional behavior.”</p>
<p>Reparenting is based on the belief that many psychological issues stem from a child growing up without his or her needs being met. The child is not <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/online-therapy-is-a-godsend-for-busy-parents/" target="_blank">made to feel secure and unconditionally loved</a>, so they grow up to be an adult who can’t navigate relationships and life as well as they should.</p>
<h2>The Three Aspects of Reparenting</h2>
<p>Reparenting deals with three theoretical aspects of an individual. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adult</li>
<li>Inner Child</li>
<li>Parent</li>
</ul>
<p>The Adult is the individual today. The Inner Child is the childhood stage at which the individual was wronged. The Parent is a therapist (or an individual) who gives the right response the child should have received. Reparenting is going back to the stage in which the adult was wronged as a child, and satisfying or making peace with the inner child hidden inside. This is done by giving the satisfactory response and fulfilling the needs that were required at that time by self-counseling or therapy.</p>
<h2><b>Forms of Reparenting </b></h2>
<p>Over the years a number of reparenting forms have been tested, three of these include:</p>
<h3><b>Total Regression </b></h3>
<p>Developed by Jaqui Lee Schiff, this <a href="https://rossaforbes.com/reparenting-and-jacqui-schiff/" target="_blank">controversial form of reparenting</a> was the first form of therapy derived from <a href="http://www.ericberne.com/transactional-analysis/" target="_blank">transactional analysis theory</a>. Typically, the patient lives with the therapist for up to several years at an institution. During this time, the patient is totally immersed in the reliving of his or her childhood. The <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a> provides all the care and nurturing with the goal of totally reforming the client&#8217;s parent ego state.</p>
<h3><b>Spot Reparenting</b></h3>
<p>Spot reparenting was developed by <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/036215377400400308?journalCode=taxa" target="_blank">Russell Osnes</a>. It focuses more on patients traumatized by specific experiences and incidents rather than by general disturbances in childhood.</p>
<h3><b>Self-Reparenting </b></h3>
<p>Unlike prior forms of reparenting, this form of reparenting by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breaking-Free-Self-Reparenting-New-Life/dp/0201046652" target="_blank">Muriel James</a> does not attempt to totally replace the parent ego state of the client. Instead, the therapy confirms the positive aspects already apparent in the client&#8217;s ego. The client is also the primary agent in therapy instead of the therapist.</p>
<h2><b>Self-Help Using Reparenting</b></h2>
<p>“For true reparenting treatment, you would want to seek out a mental health professional who was trained in the approach,” O’Neill said. “There are, however, some <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/7-self-care-tips-for-when-stress-affects-your-body/" target="_blank">self-help techniques</a> that could be useful to implement on your own.”</p>
<p>Here are a few ways to reparent yourself with self-help techniques that nurture your inner child:</p>
<ul>
<li>Affirmations that start with “I am…” For example, “I am a loving human.”</li>
<li>Talk to your Adult self and ask for help with grown up stuff.</li>
<li>Give yourself daily rewards.</li>
<li>Get at least 8 hours of sleep.</li>
<li>Read literature and inspiring quotes.</li>
<li>Write in your notebook a list of things to do on a daily basis.</li>
<li>Stay in the present by practicing mindfulness.</li>
<li>Think about good memories</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>How Do You Know if Reparenting Will Help You?</b></h2>
<p>It must be noted that though reparenting is used in psychological treatments, its use is in no way limited to those with clinically diagnosed disorders.</p>
<p>“If you feel that there are issues from your childhood that are impacting your current life, it could be a good invitation to seek out a mental health professional who can assess whether the approach could be beneficial for you,” Rachel O’Neill said.</p>
<p>You can ask your doctor for a recommendation, access the employee assistance program at your work, or check out Talkspace for professional online therapy. Many university clinics or nonprofits also offer free or affordable counseling.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe through reparenting you’ll find a trick or two for how to be a little kinder to yourself. Or maybe you’ll find that you understand the impact your childhood has had on your adult life, and you just needed someone to hear you say that out loud.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There comes a moment in many serious relationships when it is time to meet your partner’s parents. In a perfect world, you will instantly connect with these individuals who raised, supported and love your partner — after all, those very family members will likely become a major part of your life if this is a relationship for the long haul.</p>
<p>But that isn’t always the case, and you may find yourself completely disliking your loved one’s parents.</p>
<p><span id="more-10928"></span></p>
<h2>Why Parental Conflict Arises in a Relationship</h2>
<p>Forging a meaningful relationship with a partner’s family is easier said than done for some couples. Dealing with the emotional dynamics of making life decisions as a partnership can cause conflict with your loved one’s parents, who may have specific expectations for their child.</p>
<p>Additionally, issues may also arise if you choose to move away and physically distance yourselves. This causes some parents to over-compensate for the miles apart by becoming over-involved or communicating way too frequently. In any instance, it is a situation that needs to be approached delicately.</p>
<h2>How to Cope with Issues with Your Partner’s Parents</h2>
<p>To help keep the peace in your relationship when you don’t exactly get along with your partner’s parents, there are a few strategies that can help:</p>
<h3>Set boundaries and communicate clearly</h3>
<p>Have a candid conversation with your partner about how much involvement you are comfortable having with their family. When you think about what a “regular” interaction entails, does it mean a weekly family dinner or mostly seeing them around birthdays and holidays? You may find that you and your partner disagree on this front and may need to compromise when it comes to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/guide-setting-healthy-boundaries-relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">setting these boundaries</a>.</p>
<h3>See it from the parents’ perspective</h3>
<p>This is often easier said than done, but seeing the relationship from the viewpoint of your partner’s parents may help ease some of the tension. These are people who have been a part of your loved one’s life from the very start and they may feel sensitive about the emotional distance caused by a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/dating-set-boundaries-in-new-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new relationship</a>.</p>
<p>When your partner’s parents make certain comments that are perceived as criticism or control, it may be them trying to communicate something else. Try to assume more positive intent in these interactions where you can.</p>
<h3>Focus on the positive</h3>
<p>If you don’t know a person well, it’s difficult to relate to them. The same is true for your partner’s parents.</p>
<p>Try to encourage more shared activities to get to know them better and determine their motivations. Maybe they have interests in carpentry, and you can involve them more in your home renovation projects. Perhaps you find that they are master puzzle-makers and can leverage this shared interest during family get-togethers.</p>
<p>When you hone in on the good, you may be able to find <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/4-tips-dealing-difficult-people-according-therapist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">common ground</a> and enjoy each other’s company a bit more.</p>
<h2>Strengthening a Parental Relationship Benefits Your Own</h2>
<p>While it can be difficult to overcome an issue with your significant other’s family, working through it in a healthy, positive and productive way can help make your relationship even stronger.</p>
<p>While you may not have willingly chosen to be in their lives if it weren’t for your partner, there are ways to build a lasting bond with them through one major common interest: Your love for their child.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have children, you know raising kids presents challenges on your best days. Parents with mental illness, however, have it even harder.</p>
<p>In particular, parental depression can wreak havoc on a child’s psyche. What’s worse, when children develop problems related to parental depression, the added stress can make that parent’s depression worse. Thus, parental depression can turn into a long-lasting cycle of negative outcomes for the entire family.</p>
<p><span id="more-10900"></span></p>
<h2>The Effects of Parental Depression on Children</h2>
<p>In my own practice as a therapist who works with children and families, I find when parents struggle with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a>, parenting gets harder for them. Studies agree. In fact, a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16551710" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study</a> published in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> concluded, “Parental depression is among the most consistent and well-replicated risk factors for childhood anxiety and disruptive behavior disorders and for major depressive disorder.”</p>
<p>Not only do children with depressed parents likely have an increased <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/is-depression-genetic/" target="_blank">genetic risk </a>for mental illness themselves, but the parent’s depressive symptoms create additional environmental stress for the child.</p>
<p>For example, if you struggle with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/what-is-crippling-depression/" target="_blank">depression</a>, you know how hard it can be to maintain your performance at work, your duties at home, and your relationships with friends and family. If depression causes additional stressors such as marital problems or job loss, children also suffer.</p>
<p>When children grow up in stressful or uncertain environments, they can develop their own behavioral or emotional problems. Defiance, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxiety</a>, or depression are common outcomes. In fact, the majority of children I see in my practice experience family stressors. We must first address issues with their parents before we can expect the child’s behavior to improve.</p>
<h2>How Depression Affects Parenting</h2>
<p>Depression is a complex mental illness, and everyone’s experience and challenges with it differ slightly. Here are some ways a parent’s depression affects a child or family, to help recognize where changes can be made.</p>
<h3>Disrupted attachment and bonding</h3>
<p>When parents struggle with the low energy, lack of joy, and the social withdrawal depression causes, they can’t engage fully with their children. They may even have trouble mustering energy to take care of a child’s basic needs, so children learn to rely on themselves when parents are too hard to reach.</p>
<h3>Disrupted coping skills</h3>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5842251/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study</a> in the journal <i>European Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</i>, children appear to learn different coping mechanisms from mothers and fathers, so depression in either parent can affect how the child handles stress. The authors suggest mothers tend to be a calming influence, providing support when the child is upset. On the other hand, fathers tend to encourage more assertive or active coping strategies.</p>
<p>Therefore, while a child’s coping deficits may vary depending on which parent suffers depression, the impact on the child remains.</p>
<h3>Increased parental guilt or self-blame</h3>
<p>Parents who suffer from depression usually know their <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/dealing-depression-need-know/" target="_blank">symptoms</a> affect their parenting, but may find it difficult to make changes they know their children need. In addition, the negative thought patterns and rumination that go along with depression may make parents assume their parenting is worse than it really is.</p>
<p>These factors set up a cycle of guilt and self-criticism that further shakes a parent’s confidence in his or her abilities. In fact, a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5392125/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study</a> in the <i>Maternal and Child Health Journal</i> found that feeling more effective as a parent may decrease the parent’s depressive symptoms.</p>
<h3>Reinforcement of ineffective parenting strategies</h3>
<p>In my experience, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/09/pass-mental-illness-to-kids-children/" target="_blank">parents who believe they caused their children’s problems</a> have trouble setting appropriate limits with common childhood behaviors (think tantrum-ing toddler or curfew-violating teen).</p>
<p>In addition, parents who doubt their abilities may be more anxious, tending to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/raised-by-anxious-parents-heres-how-it-might-be-affecting-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">reinforce anxiety</a> in their children rather than confidently facing typical challenges such as separation anxiety. Because they have gotten into ineffective patterns and don’t know what else to do, parents in these situations often give in to misbehavior or inadvertently encourage a child’s distress.</p>
<h2>What Should Parents With Depression Do?</h2>
<p>Parenting with depression doesn’t have to be a permanent or hopeless scenario. There are plenty of ways to find help or treatment for depression, and also provide solutions for your child to help cope with a parent working through mental health challenges.</p>
<h3>1. Ask for professional help with parenting</h3>
<p>In my practice, I find parents with depression benefit from specific guidance on how to parent effectively, not just how to manage their own symptoms. A professional can help you understand typical childhood behavior, how your unique symptoms might affect that behavior, and how to develop a parenting style that works best for you.</p>
<h3>2. Get help for your child</h3>
<p>A neutral, trained adult who understands the child’s experience can alleviate much of the distress children experience when a parent has a mental illness. A <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a> can teach your child about depression and how to cope effectively when it interferes with your relationship.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, this therapy can improve the child’s behavioral and emotional problems, breaking <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/black-white-thinking-ways-poisons-your-perspective/" target="_blank">negative cycles</a> that make parental depression worse.</p>
<h3>3. Find joy in small things</h3>
<p>Sometimes living with depression means being too overwhelmed to appreciate the moment. Children, however, live in the moment all the time. In addition, they appreciate even the smallest doses of undivided attention. While you get professional help for yourself and your child, look for small joys you can share together. A 10-minute board game, a favorite snack, or a quick walk outside can make a world of difference for you both.</p>
<h2>4. Find Help for Yourself</h2>
<p>If you’re struggling with depression, day-to-day living can be overwhelming, especially if you’re also responsible for the welfare of children. Significant depressive symptoms need appropriate treatment. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">Psychotherapy</a> offers a wealth of proven benefits; in addition, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/am-i-going-to-be-on-meds-forever/" target="_blank">medication management</a> can help some individuals with depression achieve better symptom control.</p>
<p>By seeking help, you’ll find that parenting can become easier with time and healing, and your family — including your child (or children) — will benefit from a healthier, more positive environment.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like many young adults, I remember feeling convinced that once I grew up, became independent, and created a home of my own, I would be able to break free from some of the less than desirable aspects of my childhood. The problem was, it wasn’t as easy as I expected. The patterns and dynamics of my upbringing seemed to follow me wherever I went. They were a part of me.</p>
<p>I found that whenever I spent time with my family of origin, we quickly fell back into difficult patterns, no matter what I did to personally resist this behavior. And because some of my family dynamics included abandonment and abuse, these meetings could sometimes be very triggering, making me feel out of sorts (or worse) for days or weeks after.</p>
<p>It turns out I’m far from alone with this problem.</p>
<p><span id="more-10860"></span></p>
<h2>Understanding the Impact of Childhood on Your Adult Life</h2>
<p>“Many (I would venture to say nearly all) adults have been impacted in some way by their childhood,” says Christine Tolman, a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/3-therapists-open-work-talkspace/" target="_blank">Talkspace Therapist</a> from Idaho. “We become who we are through a combination of choice, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/is-anxiety-genetic/" target="_blank">genetics</a>, and how we are raised. Some childhood experiences or values were so significant they are woven into the fabric of our being, for better or worse.”</p>
<p>So what can we do if we feel that our childhood experiences continue to have significant impacts on our mental health?</p>
<h3>Recognizing your past to help move on</h3>
<p>The first step is simply to recognize this fact, says Tolman. Only then can you begin the work of healing, and moving on. It can be as straightforward as thinking about the ways that your family of origin behaves, and considering whether you replicate these patterns in your own life.</p>
<p>“Does your family scream at each other when there is conflict? Do they shut down and stop talking?” Tolman suggests you ask. “Once you recognize those patterns within your family, it may become easier to recognize them in yourself,” she says.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/mindfulness-therapy-improve-mental-health/" target="_blank">Mindfulness</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/meditation-science-eases-anxiety/" target="_blank">meditation</a> — and of course, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a> — are great ways for you to begin to explore the relationship between your family dynamics and your own emotions and behaviors, says Cynthia V. Catchings, a Talkspace therapist from Virginia.</p>
<h2>Setting Boundaries with Your Family</h2>
<p>And if being around your family of origin affects your mental health in negative ways, it’s time to instill a few <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/when-does-family-drama-become-toxic/" target="_blank">boundaries</a>, says Catchings.</p>
<p>“Boundaries help to create healthier relationships,” she explains. “It’s typically a lack of boundaries what creates issues among families.”</p>
<h3>How to set strong boundaries</h3>
<p>What does setting strong boundaries typically look like?</p>
<p>Boundaries mean that you are clear within yourself as to what kind of behavior and treatment you are willing to tolerate, and what you aren’t. “These boundaries may be ones that you share with your family (‘I will not remain in your home if you scream at me’),” says Christine Tolman, “or they may be boundaries that you set within your own mind (‘If someone at the party screams, I am going to choose to leave’).”</p>
<p>The important thing to remember about boundaries, Tolman says, is that you are in charge of setting these boundaries for yourself, but you can’t control how your families reacts to them — and as difficult as that can be, it’s something you will need to learn to accept.</p>
<p>“You can set a limit for what behaviors you will tolerate, and determine a course of action if there are behaviors you cannot tolerate (for example ‘If you choose to scream, I will choose to leave’),” Tolman explains.” The other person has the right to choose their behaviors, and you have the right to choose how to react.”</p>
<h2>Voice Your Opinion, Even if Your Boundaries Aren’t Accepted</h2>
<p>For me, this is one of the most difficult aspects of boundary setting that I’ve come against. Often, your family of origin will not readily accept your boundaries — especially if they have spent years exercising control over you. It is normal to feel a certain amount of guilt about this, says Cynthia Catchings.</p>
<p>But it is healthier for everyone involved to express their needs, limits, and boundaries — even if that sometimes means that relationships are strained for some period of time. It’s often easier said than done, but expressing your boundaries and sticking to them is essential for your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/2018-mental-health-podcasts-subscribe-to/" target="_blank">mental health</a>.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, remember this: You are an adult now, not a child. And as an adult, you deserve to have the space to feel safe, loved, and supported. Only then can you truly “break free” and begin to live your best life.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As someone who has battled an anxiety and panic disorder since childhood, one of my top concerns when I started having children was if I would pass on my disorder to my kids. I wouldn’t wish chronic panic and anxiety on anyone, and the idea that my kids might have a propensity toward it…well, it made my already anxious self that much more terrified.</p>
<p>Over a decade into this parenting thing, I will say that, for the most part, my fears were for naught. My children do share some of my tendencies toward anxiety, but it turns out that your offspring truly are their own people. And while genetics and learned behavior play a part in how they turn out, it’s not everything.</p>
<p>Most importantly, just being aware of your own mental health struggles allows you to be proactive about recognizing and seeking treatment for any issues that might arise in your children.</p>
<p><span id="more-10851"></span></p>
<h2>Tips for Parenting With Mental Health Challenges</h2>
<p>Here are some tips that have helped me navigate the waters of parenting as a person with mental health issues:</p>
<h3>1. Be open about your mental health with your child</h3>
<p>It may feel counterintuitive at first, but speaking openly about your mental health issues is an invaluable way to mitigate the risks of passing on your issues to your child, by modeling a proactive approach to mental health care. For example, if you are in a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/sadness-or-depression-how-to-know/" target="_blank">depressive funk</a>, simply saying “Mommy is feeling very sad right now” allows your child to see that it’s okay to talk about difficult feelings, and that there is no shame in <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxiety</a>, or whatever intense feelings people experience.</p>
<p>Adding on something like, “It’s something that Mommy is working on, and not your fault” makes it clear that these things can be dealt with, and removes blame from your child (children will often internalize a parent’s mood, even if they don’t say so). Down the road, if your child does experience mental health issues, the knowledge that it’s acceptable to talk about these sorts of things will go a long way.</p>
<h3>2. Model good coping strategies</h3>
<p>My children know I am in therapy. They know my <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/mental-health-workout-plan/" target="_blank">daily exercising</a> and meditation sessions are mandatory ways that I practice wellness. In fact, my <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/raised-by-anxious-parents-heres-how-it-might-be-affecting-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">anxiety-prone child</a> has started practicing mediation with me!</p>
<p>As a parent, I have found it even more important to keep up with my mental health self-care routines — not just so I can make it through the intense years of parenting — but also so I can show my kids that taking care of your mental health is as important as <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/how-to-eat-your-way-to-mental-health/" target="_blank">eating</a>, sleeping, or going for a check-up at the doctor.</p>
<h3>3. Passing on your mental health condition to your child is not inevitable</h3>
<p>It’s not totally irrational that those of us with mental health issues fear passing on our issues to our kids. After all, there is a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/is-depression-genetic/" target="_blank">genetic component</a> to many mental health disorders. But just because your child <i>might</i> inherit your disorder doesn’t mean that they <i>will</i>.</p>
<p>There are so many factors that go into how your child turns out, and though you don’t have control of all of them, you do have the power to create the most nurturing and supportive environment you can.</p>
<h3>4. Don’t punish yourself when your mental health gets the better of you</h3>
<p>All of us with mental health issues have our bad days. And I’m going to be perfectly honest with you: sometimes being a parent can trigger mental health issues in <i>big</i> ways. But that is why it is so important to be open about your struggles with your kids (see #1) and always be gentle with yourself when your issues come up.</p>
<p>Your children don’t need a perfect parent: they need one who is willing to own their shortcomings, apologize when things go haywire, and make an effort to be the best version of themselves as possible.</p>
<h3>5. Having lived through mental health issues gives you an advantage</h3>
<p>The fact that you are aware enough of your disorder to own the label — and even read an article about passing on your mental illness to your child! — means that you can use your self-awareness to your advantage. This awareness is one of the key components that can protect your child from the symptoms and detrimental behavior related to your mental health disorder. You may be better equipped to recognize the emerging symptoms of mental health issues in your child, allowing you to promptly get them the help they need.</p>
<h2>It’s Natural to Worry, but There are Solutions!</h2>
<p>I won’t sugar-coat over the fact that I still get worried sick at times about passing on my mental health struggles to my kids. But even if the worst case scenario emerges, and they struggle with mental health issues as intensely as I have, I don’t regret bringing them into the world. As the years pass, more solutions and support will become available to them should they need.</p>
<p>Children are complex creatures, full of gifts and surprises that you can’t even fathom until you have your own. And as difficult as mental health issues are to live with, they don’t define a person. Remember that your children (and you too!) are more than your genetics, and more than any mental health disorder — and that each of us has more grit and resilience than we realize.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have noticed that your intimate relationships have been stressful or unfulfilling, it might be time to think about your attachment style. Attachment style derives from your earliest experiences with your parents.</p>
<p>Knowing the effects these parenting styles have on you as a child helps you better understand the roots of potential relationship issues, and where to begin when addressing these issues — whether on your own, or with the help of a therapist.</p>
<p><span id="more-10817"></span></p>
<h2>The Two Types of Attachment</h2>
<p>There are two main types of attachment: <b>secure</b> and <b>insecure</b>.</p>
<h2>Secure attachment explained</h2>
<p>A securely attached baby knows that their <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/raised-by-anxious-parents-heres-how-it-might-be-affecting-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">parents</a> are involved and caring. There is a healthy balance between comfort, affection, independence, and exploration. For instance, a securely attached baby will play with an interesting toy, but then crawl back to her mother for comfort when she is tired.</p>
<p>Secure attachment is created by a parent who is confident in expressing love, and also confident about allowing their child to explore their environment. A securely attached child learns that the world is a safe and friendly place, and that loved ones can be trusted to give you space, but also to provide you with nurturance and closeness.</p>
<p>As an adult in an <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/guide-setting-healthy-boundaries-relationships/" target="_blank">intimate relationship</a>, a securely attached person will be trusting and open, able to give their partner space while being confident that their partner will return to them. They will not be excessively jealous or distant, which are both hallmarks of insecurity.</p>
<h2>Insecure attachment explained</h2>
<p>Within insecure attachment, there are two subtypes: <b>preoccupied</b> and <b>avoidant</b>.</p>
<h3>Preoccupied insecure attachment</h3>
<p>People with preoccupied attachment had parents who could not be counted upon to give love and comfort when needed. They showed love, but only when it was convenient for them. At other times, they could act cold, distant, or even abusive. Parents with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/really-means-psychopath-sociopath-narcissist/" target="_blank">narcissism</a> or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/borderline-personality-disorder/" target="_blank">borderline personality disorder</a> often foster preoccupied attachment in their children. Kids with preoccupied attachment learn to be hypervigilant around their parents, trying to be present in case a loving moment happens, while keeping their guard up in case they end up getting hurt.</p>
<p>In adulthood, preoccupied individuals act jealous and clingy with their significant others. They struggle with trust and can act smothering and intrusive within intimate relationships. They are trying to make up for their childhood, where their parent’s love was unpredictable. Now, in adulthood, they want to control their partner and ensure that they are always present. As you can imagine, this often ends up pushing partners away, which makes the preoccupied partner even more <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxious</a>.</p>
<h3>Avoidant insecure attachment</h3>
<p>On the other end of the insecure attachment spectrum is avoidant attachment. Children with avoidant attachment learn that their parents cannot be relied upon for emotional sustenance at all. These parents are consistently cold, distant, or even <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/turn-childhood-hardship-success-2/">neglectful or abusive</a>. These kids learn that it is unsafe to rely upon others for emotional closeness, and they become extremely independent at an early age.</p>
<p>As adults, those with avoidant attachment have great difficulty with expressing need or vulnerability. They find it almost impossible to rely on anyone, or to ask for their needs to be met. This can be very frustrating for their romantic partners, who yearn for a closer connection than the avoidant partner may feel comfortable providing. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/identifying-avoidant-partner-improve-relationship/" target="_blank">Avoidant partners</a> often cheat, or date many people simultaneously. Anything to avoid feeling dependent on one person, who they subconsciously fear will disappoint them as their parents did.</p>
<h2>Mental Health Challenges Can Create Parental Distance</h2>
<p>Parents of both types of insecurely attached people are not bad or ill-intentioned. They did not try to be distant or unpredictable. They love their children and may have been struggling with issues such as personality disorders, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a>, anxiety, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/addiction/" target="_blank">addiction</a>, or trauma histories of their own.</p>
<p>They may have been overwhelmed by the demands of parenting, or in marriages that did not provide them with the emotional support that they needed. No matter the reason, it still stands that they were unable to give their children the secure love that they needed, and this has an impact long past childhood.</p>
<h2>What to do if You’re Insecure in Your Attachment Style</h2>
<p>If you recognize yourself or your partner in the above insecure attachment descriptions, you may want to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/know-youre-ready-therapy/" target="_blank">consider therapy</a>. If you recognize one, you likely recognize both, as avoidant and preoccupied individuals are typically drawn to one another and exacerbate each other’s attachment issues.. Additionally, reading up on attachment, such as the book <i>Attached</i> by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller, can provide you with important insight into yourself and your relationships.</p>
<p>It can be very illuminating to discuss your upbringing with a therapist, and to finally understand the root of whatever unfulfilling relationship patterns you exhibit.</p>
