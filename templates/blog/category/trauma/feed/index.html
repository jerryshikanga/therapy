				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone affected by breast cancer knows the physical hardship it can bring. What’s less commonly talked about, but also important, is how breast cancer affects patients’ and survivors’ mental health.</p>
<p>A history of mental illness can be exacerbated by a breast cancer diagnosis, and the rigors of treatment — while life-saving — are difficult, leaving many women depressed, anxious, or feeling alone.</p>
<p>October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, a time to recognize women affected by breast cancer and raise awareness about breast cancer prevention. Many breast cancer survivors have <a href="https://www.lbbc.org/news-opinion/%E2%80%98you-feel-so-lost%E2%80%99-facing-breast-cancer-when-you-have-mood-or-anxiety-disorder" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">spoken up</a> about their struggles with mental illness. To honor their voices, here’s what you need to know about breast cancer and mental health.</p>
<p><span id="more-11023"></span></p>
<h2>Breast Cancer Can Negatively Impact Mental Health</h2>
<p>If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with breast cancer, you know firsthand that a diagnosis can have long-lasting mental health effects. From <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a> about the future to the stress of treatment, it’s totally normal to feel a mix of intense emotions after a breast cancer diagnosis.</p>
<p>While normal, this turmoil can cause long-term mental health challenges. <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/03/160302082618.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Studies show</a> that a majority of people with breast cancer will subsequently develop symptoms of PTSD, and these symptoms tend to last longer than a year. Even after successful treatment, fear of recurrence <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pon.3452" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">affects many women</a> and can be so severe it negatively impacts their quality of life.</p>
<p>After a breast cancer diagnosis, a woman’s relationship with her body might change as well. While life-saving, mastectomies can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4743280/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">decrease women’s body confidence</a>, impact their relationships to their sexuality, and have a negative effect on overall mental health.</p>
<h2>Your Mental Health Affects Your Physical Health</h2>
<p>Mental illness doesn’t just cause distress to breast cancer patients, it can actually impact their physical health, including their mortality risk.</p>
<p>Pre-existing mental health conditions can make it harder for a patient to cope after a breast cancer diagnosis, in turn negatively affecting their long-term physical and emotional health. A history of trauma <a href="https://healthblog.uofmhealth.org/cancer-care/mental-health-may-predict-pain-levels-after-breast-cancer-treatment" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">can increase</a> breast cancer survivors’ risk of chronic pain even after treatment. More alarmingly, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10549-013-2795-4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">several studies</a> <a href="http://www.cancernetwork.com/breast-cancer/breast-cancer-patients-mental-illness-face-higher-mortality-risk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">have found</a> that women with depression have a higher risk of mortality both from the cancer itself and from other factors — <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/hematologyoncology/breastcancer/70104" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">up to double</a> the risk of death in elderly women.</p>
<p>While grim, these findings make sense. As the American Psychological Association <a href="http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/breast-cancer.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">points out</a>, a breast cancer diagnosis is a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/recognizing-trauma-vs-ptsd-quick-primer-symptoms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traumatic event</a> and it’s normal to have a range of emotional reactions to the diagnosis. Meanwhile, mental illness can exacerbate these natural feelings, making it even harder for patients to do things that benefit their health, like eat healthy foods, exercise, connect with friends and family, and perhaps most importantly, comply with their medical treatment.</p>
<p>The good news? Prioritizing mental health can actually be lifesaving. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2661422/?tool=pubmed" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Research shows</a> that women with breast cancer who avail of mental health support have a decreased risk of recurrence and death, even years after therapy.</p>
<h2>Seeking Support for a Breast Cancer Diagnosis</h2>
<p>If you’ve been diagnosed with breast cancer, it’s a great idea to talk to a therapist. A therapist <a href="http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/breast-cancer.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">can help you cope</a> throughout your breast cancer journey.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/breast-cancer.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">APA recommends</a> a combination of group therapy, which allows women to share emotional support, and individual therapy, which helps women learn problem-solving skills and alter patterns of negative thinking. A therapist can also help you work through <a href="https://share.upmc.com/2017/10/life-after-mastectomy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">body image or sexuality</a> issues related to a mastectomy or treatment in general.</p>
<p>While breast cancer and mental illness may both feel like insurmountably large problems, you can take simple steps every day to feel better. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/how-to-exercise-your-way-to-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Staying as active as you can</a>, focusing on healthy eating including lots of fruits and vegetables, and reaching out to friends, family, a support group, or a faith group can all help, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/survivors/patients/staying-healthy-during-cancer-treatment.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">says the CDC</a>.</p>
<p>You also don’t have to be a medical professional to give support to people in your life with breast cancer. Social support matters, too. <a href="https://www.oatext.com/Social-support-quality-of-life-and-mental-health-status-in-breast-cancer-patients.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Research shows</a> that having supportive intimate partners and family members increases breast cancer survivors’ overall wellbeing.</p>
<h3>Caretakers Deserve Care, Too</h3>
<p>If someone in your life is diagnosed with breast cancer, it’s normal to want to do everything you can to support them. That’s a great impulse, and your loved one deserves all the care and support you can offer. But in looking out for your loved ones, don’t forget to care for yourself.</p>
<p>A breast cancer diagnosis doesn’t just affect the mental health of the person with cancer; it can also have a serious effect on the mental health of family and friends. One study revealed that men whose partners had breast cancer were at an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20878654" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">increased risk</a> of hospitalization for an affective disorder like depression subsequent to the diagnosis. While it’s easy to feel that you don’t deserve support since you’re not the one with the diagnosis, that’s simply untrue: taking care of yourself makes you better able to care for your loved ones.</p>
<h2>Personal Support is Crucial</h2>
<p>A breast cancer diagnosis can make patients and their loved ones feel powerless, and mental health issues, while common, can exacerbate this feeling. Some things truly are outside of our control, and accepting this can make you feel understandably overwhelmed. But there are simple things we can do to support the mental health of loved ones with breast cancer every single day.</p>
<p>One of the most effective strategies is also the simplest: simply be there.</p>
<p><i>If you or a loved one are struggling after a breast cancer diagnosis, you deserve support. The American Cancer Society has a range of </i><a href="https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/emotional-side-effects/anxiety-fear-depression.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><i>mental health</i></a> <a href="https://www.cancer.org/treatment/support-programs-and-services.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><i>resources</i></a><i> for people with cancer and caretakers. You can also consult the Susan G. Komen Foundation’s </i><a href="https://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/SupportGroups.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><i>list</i></a><i> of breast cancer support groups. </i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to a Center for Disease Control (CDC) <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf" target="_blank">National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey</a>, one in six U.S. men have experienced sexual violence, and 17% of those men develop symptoms of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/the-history-of-ptsd/" target="_blank">post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</a>. In my years practicing <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a>, I’ve found male survivors face unique challenges to recovery, yet hesitate to get the help they need.</p>
<p>The question is why.</p>
<p>For one, we don’t hear much about male sexual assault survivors, although one <a href="https://www.jimhopper.com/pdfs/Dube_(2005)_Childhood_sexual_abuse_by_gender_of_victim.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> found sexual assault history was common among both women and men, reported by 25% of women and 16% of men surveyed. The research participants also faced similar long-term problems, regardless of gender.</p>
<p><span id="more-9131"></span></p>
<p>This same study found both male and female victims faced increased risk for <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/who-should-you-share-your-addiction-and-recovery-with/" target="_blank">substance abuse</a>, relationship problems, and suicide attempts. In addition to PTSD symptoms, the aforementioned CDC report also found male and female survivors experience physical problems such as headaches, chronic pain, or gastrointestinal symptoms.</p>
<h2>The Gender Gap</h2>
<p>In my clinical experience, I’ve seen that males and females each bring distinct concerns to therapy. Unfortunately, there remains a significant gender gap in research on sexual victimization — and that keeps the conversations about sexual violence often limited to female survivors.</p>
<p>Of course, this gap also affects mental health and general medical care. In fact, according to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4116270/pdf/permj18_3p0082.pdf" target="_blank">a 2014 study</a>, doctors treating male survivors of sexual assault have far fewer guidelines available to them than physicians treating females do.</p>
<p>Simply put, male survivors have more trouble than female survivors finding knowledgeable providers when they seek help.</p>
<h2>Stereotypes and Power</h2>
<p>In my work with male survivors, I’ve found abuse brings up challenges to the conditioning we&#8217;ve all received about gender identity — specifically, what it means to “be a man.”</p>
<p>Because common male stereotypes value toughness, males must contend with society’s expectations that they remain strong and silent.</p>
<p>Stereotypes suggest men enjoy heterosexual experiences of any kind, so some feel unmasculine if a sexual interaction makes them uncomfortable. For example, boys abused by women sometimes wonder if there’s something wrong with them for reporting it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the majority of people who commit sexual assault are male. In the case of a male perpetrator and heterosexual victim, survivors may struggle with questions about gender identity and sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Sexual assault often revolves more around power than gender. Male survivors also face feelings of powerlessness, wondering why they weren’t “man enough” to stop abuse.</p>
<h2>Coping Mechanisms and Treatment Barriers</h2>
<p>Men who have experienced sexual assault are more likely to engage in risky behaviors or substance abuse to cope with complex feelings. These problems may bring men into treatment, but they mask the underlying issues. When men feel uncomfortable disclosing assault, therapy can be less effective.</p>
<p>Because many male survivors experienced assault at the hands of an authority figure (think coach or youth leader), they having trouble trusting other authorities — even doctors. These men avoid medical care, even though the sexual assault also makes them more likely to have health problems.</p>
<h2>Getting Help</h2>
<p>Even with these unique challenges, therapy and other medical interventions can reduce the impact of assault history on overall health and well-being. If you decide <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/7-self-care-tips-for-sexual-assault-survivors/" target="_blank">to get help for yourself</a> or a loved one, consider the following guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Ask Questions First</strong></p>
<p>When you’re calling <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/08/the-different-types-of-therapists-and-counselors-the-complete-guide/" target="_blank">new therapists</a>, ask about their experience working with male survivors of sexual assault. If you need a doctor for a physical problem, ask for an appointment to talk about your history and concerns first, even before you go in for a physical exam.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate Your Needs</strong></p>
<p>Let providers know how they can make you more comfortable. You can request they move at a slower pace, explain treatments thoroughly, and ask permission before any new intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Plan for Setbacks</strong></p>
<p>Feelings of powerlessness and other triggers in treatment can send your coping mechanisms flying out the window. Develop a plan with your provider for how you’ll handle distress, perhaps by taking a break to regain composure or briefly changing topics.</p>
<p><strong>Look for Signs of a Good Match</strong></p>
<p>Does the provider respond to your assault story with close attention and a supportive tone? Does the provider explain interventions, answer questions, and seek your input?</p>
<h2>The Therapeutic Relationship</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">Most therapists, myself included, welcome feedback</a> to make you more comfortable through a difficult process. Therapy is hard work, but it’s a collaborative relationship. Being open with your therapist about your feelings in the here and now, within that relationship, brings about the best care.</p>
<p>Although male survivors of sexual assault face distinct challenges receiving the treatment they need, it is possible to find knowledgeable, sensitive providers who can help you face those challenges.</p>
<p>What’s more, coming forward with your experiences not only helps you feel better, but helps the medical community better understand the needs of this too-often silent group.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I remember the day I started self-injuring. It was January my senior year of high school. I was being sexually abused by a teacher and eventually I just snapped — I couldn’t handle anymore. When I got home that day, I grabbed a red-handled paring knife from the kitchen and slashed shallow cuts into my upper left arm until I counted 100. I needed some way to prove I had control of my body, to express the hard emotions I was feeling.</p>
<p>The relief from the pain, confusion, and distress was instant — it immediately calmed the chaos in my mind. Once I started, it was hard to stop. And so I found myself at 21 self-injuring to manage the hearings after reporting my abusive teacher. I was still self-injuring at 28 when I did an interview about my experience with perpetrators; grooming process of victims, and at 30 when I began processing 15 years worth of trauma. And finally, after 13 years of self-injuring, I was finally able to stop.</p>
<p>Through all of it, self-injury served as my friend, my relief, my secret sanctuary — but it also complicated my ability to cope with difficult emotions and to connect with other people. The damage is criss-crossed all over my arms in scars, messages of deep hurt, but also survival. Self-injury is both savior and monster, a complex way to deal with overwhelming emotions.<span id="more-6711"></span></p>
<h2>What Is Self-Injury?</h2>
<p>Non-suicidal self-injury is defined as inflicting intentional bodily harm without suicidal intent. It often manifests through cutting, burning, or hitting oneself on the hands, arms, stomach, thighs, and other areas of the body. While it may seem counterintuitive, the main purpose of self-injury is to relieve severely distressing emotions.</p>
<p>“One of the things we&#8217;re finding out [in] recent research is that self-injurers tend to self-injure for a much more narrow reason, and that&#8217;s to escape really negative uncomfortable feeling states,” says Wendy Lader, co-founder of the pioneering <a href="https://selfinjury.com/" target="_blank">S.A.F.E. Alternatives</a> self-injury recovery program. “And that is basically the main reason.”</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.mdedge.com/currentpsychiatry/article/66298/nonsuicidal-self-injury-how-categorization-guides-treatment" target="_blank">Current Psychiatry</a>, self-injury relieves symptoms such as “untenable anxiety, depressed mood, racing thoughts, swirling emotions, anger, hallucinations, and flashbacks” for 90 percent of patients. In addition to calming distressing thoughts and emotions, self-injury also serves as a way to “feel real” and relieve “dissociation, depersonalization, grief, insecurity, loneliness, extreme boredom, self-pity, and alienation.”</p>
<p>Self-harm works because, as Smithsonian Magazine <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/theres-scientific-reason-why-self-harm-makes-some-people-feel-better-180953062/?no-ist" target="_blank">reports</a>, “emotions are psychological, but they are also physical,” since physical and emotional pain are felt in similar areas of the brain. Self-injury becomes a maladaptive coping skill to regulate emotional affect through the physical body.</p>
<h2>Who Self-Injures?</h2>
<p>Self-harm impacts many people of all ages and genders. When we look at the numbers, per the <a href="http://www.selfinjury.bctr.cornell.edu/perch/resources/siinfo-2.pdf" target="_blank">Cornell Research Program on Self-Injury and Recovery</a>, 17.2 percent of adolescents, 13.4 percent of young adults, and 5.5 percent of adults self-injure.</p>
<p>Self-injury is most common in adolescents, starting on average at around age 15. A large majority of young people who start self-injuring will typically “outgrow” the behavior after five years as their brain develops and they learn more mature skills to cope with emotions.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, self-injury is equally common in both men and women. Women typically start self-injuring at a younger age and men are more likely to self-harm while high or drunk and in a social situation.</p>
<h2>Myths About Self-Injury</h2>
<p>Though self-injury affects men and women equally, the pop culture image of self-harm — the “emo teenage girl seeking attention” — is still so pervasive, self-injury remains one of the most stigmatized mental health issues out there. As a result, a few common myths persist about self-injury.</p>
<p>First, many equate self-injury with a suicide attempt. While those who self-injure do have a higher risk of suicide, self-injury itself is not a suicide attempt. It’s an attempt to feel better and regulate emotions, which is actually a good thing. Self-injurers generally want to get better and feel better, which is a much different objective than suicide.</p>
<p>“Most self-injurers, even though they say that ‘I don&#8217;t really want to stop,’ most of them do,” says Lader. “They really just want to release some emotional pain and if you can help them with that then they get better. With self-injury it&#8217;s sort of an internal process and if they can really like themselves and feel more comfortable in their own skin then they don&#8217;t need to self injure.”</p>
<p>Secondly, self-injury is not primarily an attention-seeking behavior. This myth persists with such regularity, many times self-injurers will find a lack of compassion from family members, friends, and even mental health professionals who write off the behavior as “just” trying to get attention.</p>
<p>While a part of self-harm may be to gain attention, often it’s at least secondary to a desire to feel better emotionally. Furthermore, if someone needs to injure themselves in order to feel seen and heard, this is a call for help that needs to be honored in its own right.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s still common to associate self-injury only with the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, which further stigmatizes people who self-harm. While this can be a symptom of BPD, it’s not the only diagnosis those with self-injury may have. People with depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and other diagnoses, may also struggle with self-harm.</p>
<h2>Treatment of Self-Injury</h2>
<p>To recover from self-injury, it’s important to deal with the issues underlying self-harm itself, as it is mostly a symptom, rather than a standalone issue. In most cases, finding professional help is the first place to start.</p>
<p>While self-harm is better understood now, it’s still a good idea to find a clinician who truly has experience working with self injury. Finding proper help starts by being honest with on your intake assessment, or if you’re using online therapy, your Talkspace matching therapist. Also, look for referrals from sites that specialize in self-injury, such as S.A.F.E. Alternatives, the <a href="http://www.selfinjuryfoundation.org/index.html" target="_blank">Self-Injury Foundation</a>, or <a href="https://twloha.com/" target="_blank">To Write Love On Her Arms</a>.</p>
<p>Group support can also help those who self-injure. Though groups specifically for self-injury are sometimes hard to find, joining another type of group that will address the issues underlying self-injury can go a long way in providing additional support. For example, consider finding a 12-step program, a trauma therapy group, an LGBTQ support group, or a <a href="https://behavioraltech.org/resources/faqs/what-is-dbt/" target="_blank">Dialectical Behavioral Therapy</a> skills class.</p>
<p>When working with a mental health professional, they will help teach those who self-harm immediate skills to cope with overwhelming emotions, while resolving the larger causes of self-injury, such as trauma, depression, or anxiety.</p>
<p>In-the-moment <a href="http://www.selfinjury.bctr.cornell.edu/perch/resources/distraction-techniques-pm-2.pdf" target="_blank">coping skills</a> to interrupt urges to self-harm will be crucial to eventually stopping the impulse to self-injure. These skills include soothing or distracting activities such as taking a bath, going for a walk, coloring or drawing, journaling, or calling a friend.</p>
<p>As a person who self-injures learns to use alternative coping skills and begins to resolve the causes of self-injury, they will begin to heal. Recovery may not happen overnight. It takes time, effort, and hard work to end self-injury, and often years, as it did in my case. But know that full recovery and a life free of self-harm is possible.</p>
<p>“[Self-injurers are] creative, bright, wonderful, people who have so much to give and this is a behavior that was really…destroying their lives,” says Lader. “Once they&#8217;re free of that, it&#8217;s just amazing what they can do.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you experienced trauma or abuse during childhood, you might wonder if you should seek <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a>. But maybe you are too busy to commute to appointments. You don’t even have any time to feel everything, much less talk about it.</p>
<p>Then there are the plethora of worries people sometimes have when they consider working with a therapist. You might think, “What if I end up feeling worse? What if the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a> thinks I don’t have any problems? Am I exaggerating my experiences?”</p>
<p>Then you start wondering why everyone else seems so happy, while your head swims with worries and you slog through each day. You are not alone, and there are ways to feel better.<span id="more-6609"></span></p>
<p>I recently completed research on 300 successful men and women. Roughly 40% of them reported experiencing childhood abuse, witnessing family violence, or having an alcoholic parent while growing up. Even more people reported growing up in poverty, having a parent with a mental illness, or losing a family member.</p>
<p>Childhood adversity is common, yet it leaves an indelible mark on one’s psyche. The men were affected as often as the women. My study participants described the negative impact from this kind of adversity as:</p>
<ul>
<li>anxiety</li>
<li>being easily emotionally triggered</li>
<li>fear of speaking and identifying their truth</li>
<li>poor boundaries with others</li>
<li>depression</li>
<li>overeating and overdrinking</li>
<li>lack of self-confidence</li>
<li>shame</li>
<li>poor communication skills</li>
<li>lack of conflict negotiation skills</li>
</ul>
<p>Such a significant impact begs the question of how these adults overcame their disruptive childhoods to achieve success and happiness. Most of them remembered a pivotal moment when they identified the strengths gained from their childhood survival skills and committed to changing their futures. Many of them sought out a therapist to listen to their hardships and provide insights and education to further the healing process.</p>
<h2>Therapy Can Help</h2>
<p>Childhood misfortunes make everything more difficult — self-confidence, conflict resolution, being in love, and being successful. A therapist can help people identify, fully describe, and respect their journey, and also appreciate their own “hard won” survival skills.</p>
<p>The high achievers I studied described their adaptive survival skills as:</p>
<ul>
<li>sensitivity and empathy for others</li>
<li>patience and support</li>
<li>independence</li>
<li>resilience</li>
<li>intuitiveness about group politics</li>
<li>becoming a student of communication and conflict negotiation skills</li>
<li>leading a values-driven life</li>
</ul>
<p>Growing up without good role models for personal and professional success necessitated becoming serious students of life skills, transforming their childhood survival skills into adult strengths. This helped them excel in areas where others were only average.</p>
<p>You can feel much better today as an adult than you did as a child and adolescent. You are not helpless to change your moods, behaviors, and circumstances. It does, however, require a commitment to personal growth and often is enhanced with the right therapist.</p>
<p>Tips from those who experienced childhood family violence and alcoholism include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify your values and live a values-driven life</li>
<li>Self-compassion</li>
<li>Identify and eliminate self-defeating behaviors</li>
<li>Increase self-confidence through accepting challenges and improving your internal dialogue</li>
<li>Prayer and spirituality</li>
<li>Meditation/mindfulness</li>
<li>Exercise regularly</li>
<li>Spend time in nature</li>
<li>Learn assertiveness and conflict negotiation skills</li>
<li>Rewrite your family story with a focus on accomplishments and strengths</li>
<li>Seek individual therapy with a therapist trained in trauma recovery</li>
</ul>
<h2>Facing Your Problems Head On</h2>
<p>You can run, but you cannot hide from your childhood. It has become a part of who you are, for better or for worse. Nonetheless, the energy spent in pretending to have had a blissful and healthy family as a kid may be better spent turning around and facing the demons in the face. See your past for what it was — a tragedy that you were not given the love and care children need. The realization that childhood trauma leads to lifelong struggles with mental and physical health is shocking and may become a pivotal moment toward greater mental health.</p>
<p>We cope, try to stay optimistic, and push the past as far away as possible. But what if you choose to stop and face the pain? One Minneapolis-based psychologist and licensed marriage and family therapist explained the impact on a child when experiencing trauma and how therapy may be helpful.</p>
<blockquote><p>“A child is very vulnerable to messages from their parents and so negative messages become very deeply embedded into their psyche. It damages their core sense of self and worthiness. Often children think there is something wrong with them and if they would have been a better kid, these bad family problems would not have happened. At the very time when children are learning how to bond or attach with others, there is uncertainty and abandonment. The child starts seeing the world as an unsafe place and their trust in other people is damaged; therefore, they become hyper-vigilant. Post-traumatic stress symptoms develop to varying degrees with those who experienced childhood trauma, including flashbacks, nightmares, anxiety, avoidance of situations that remind you of the past, angry outbursts, and lack of a sense of the future. To numb these feelings, people turn to alcoholism, eating disorders, and other behaviors that harm one’s self. Counseling can be very valuable in changing these patterns.”</p></blockquote>
<p>For myself, I did not want to wait until retirement, rocking in my chair on the porch, wondering about my past. I have stopped, looked it in the eye, and worked to recover the happy self I could have been as a child.</p>
<p>My journey and those of others I admire are outlined in my book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Adversity-Advantage-Childhood-Hardship-Success-ebook/dp/B06ZYN2MHK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1501861444&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+adversity+advantage+jude+miller+burke" target="_blank">The Adversity Advantage: Turn Your Childhood Hardships Into Career and Life Success</a></em>. Consider taking the self-assessments and reading the real stories of others who have transformed their lives into a level of well-being and happiness. You can benefit from their wise and doable advice.</p>
<p>I believe therapy is important in the recovery process. Find a knowledgeable and licensed therapist who has competency in trauma recovery or abuse, someone to provide witness to your family history.</p>
<p>The goal is to identify and release painful emotions from childhood while focusing on improving self-esteem and self-compassion to create a healthy life. Time definitely heals, but the degree to which you heal depends on whether you expend meaningful effort to understand and change your behaviors.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started self-injuring when I was 17-years-old, the result of not knowing how to manage the overwhelming emotions accompanying years of sexual abuse by a teacher. Self-injury became my way of expressing extreme feelings of fear, anger, sadness, hopelessness, shame, and a complete loss of control. Over time, self-injury became the only way I knew how to deal with emotions, and I didn&#8217;t know what else to do.</p>
<p>When I decided I wanted to stop self-harming, the only information I could find advised me to color on my arms with markers, snap a rubber band on my wrist or hold an ice cube. If I was angry, the suggestions were to &#8220;get it out&#8221; by punching pillows, ripping magazines or throwing ice against a wall.</p>
<p>Well, in short, drawing on my arms with red marker only increased my desire to see real blood and holding ice cubes didn&#8217;t hurt enough. At the end of the day, all I wanted to do was cut or burn for real. And I still felt overwhelmed.</p>
<p>It turns out I&#8217;m not alone in this experience, and these popular substitute self-injury alternatives are partly to blame.<span id="more-6033"></span></p>
<h2>The Problem with Self-Harm Substitutes</h2>
<p>The problem with holding ice or snapping a rubber band on your wrist comes is that these are not alternatives — they are not distracting a person during a moment of crisis — but rather, they are merely substitutes. It&#8217;s the same self-destructive mindset and behavior in a different wrapper.</p>
<p>&#8220;We view substitute behaviors as self-injury,&#8221; says Michelle Seliner, MSW, LCSW and current chief operating officer of the self-injury recovery program, <a href="https://selfinjury.com/" target="_blank">S.A.F.E. Alternatives</a>. &#8220;Snapping a rubber band on your arm leaves a mark and it&#8217;s painful. It&#8217;s self-injury.&#8221;</p>
<p>These alternatives may remain so common because self-injury itself is so hard to give up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Self-injury is a coping strategy, so telling somebody to give it up is really hard — it&#8217;s not easy,&#8221; says Seliner. &#8220;Probably one of the reasons substitute behaviors, you see so much of them, is because it really is self-injury but just a different form.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another popular suggestion recommends drawing on your arm with red marker to mimic cutting. While coloring on an arm may not cause permanent bodily damage, walking around with red marker on the body isn&#8217;t going to work well in a school or professional setting. It&#8217;s not a practical or permanent solution to coping with emotional dysregulation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drawing on your arm with a red magic marker is going to do nothing but draw negative attention,&#8221; says Seliner. &#8220;It&#8217;s another way that people are using their body as a bulletin board to communicate to the world what they&#8217;re feeling.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The Psychology Behind Substitutes</h2>
<p>Beyond the fact that these stand-ins for self-injury can cause damage of their own and don&#8217;t resolve the underlying issues behind the impulse to self-injure, they are outright ineffective. Substitute behaviors only make people want to self-injure more.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s actually a poll on [S.A.F.E. Alternative&#8217;s] website on substitute behaviors and we ask self-injurers if they&#8217;ve used a substitute behavior such as drawing on their hands with a red magic marker, snapping rubber bands, holding ice cubes, breaking an egg over their skin, if that increased their impulses,&#8221; says Seliner. &#8220;More than half of the people who answered the poll who engage in self-injury, if they engaged in substitute behaviors, their impulses to injure actually increased.&#8221;</p>
<p>Similarly, cathartic behaviors meant to release anger such as punching pillows, ripping newspapers or throwing ice against a wall do not serve their intended purpose to discharge negative energy, but rather further aggravate a person.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have heard from our patients frequently that they continually feel overstimulated, revved up and that this contributes to their escalating panic and agitation,&#8221; writes S.A.F.E. Alternatives co-founders Wendy Lader and Karen Conterio in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bodily-Harm-Breakthrough-Healing-Self-Injurers/dp/0786885041" target="_blank">Bodily Harm: The Breakthrough Healing Program For Self-Injurers</a>. &#8220;Recommending physical activity to people who feel this way is like throwing gasoline on a fire: it makes them more out of control rather than less.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anger is a secondary emotion and often times when you get underneath the anger you&#8217;ll find a different emotion, most commonly sadness, hurt, rejection, shame,&#8221; adds Seliner. &#8220;We teach [clients] how to communicate their anger in a healthy, appropriate way rather than discharging it with a physical act.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Why These Self-Injury Substitutes are Popular</h2>
<p>Despite evidence that all of these unhelpful suggestions to combat self-injury are counterproductive, their recommendation persists, even among therapists. This includes some of the best, most effective therapists I’ve encountered over the years.</p>
<p>This may be thanks to the proliferation of these substitute behaviors on the internet. Though safe havens such as S.A.F.E. Alternatives or the <a href="http://www.selfinjuryfoundation.org/index.html" target="_blank">Self Injury Foundation</a> work to educate people otherwise, the old methods are drowning out safer distractions. The public knowledge of how to help those who self-injure is built largely on repeating the same coping skills in article after article.</p>
<p>A Google search for self-injury alternatives, for example, comes up with this as the highlighted option: &#8220;Hurt yourself in a relatively harmless way, like holding ice, or rubbing ice on the spot you would normally cut or burn. Chew up a hot pepper or rub liniment under your nose. Snap your wrist with a rubber band.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the most often-repeated options are not always the best, and that is certainly the case with these out-of-date self-injury alternatives. In fact, it&#8217;s time to retire these self-harm substitutes altogether.</p>
<p>So what should those who self-injure do instead?</p>
<h2>Alternatives to Self-Harm</h2>
<p>The true purpose of a self-injury alternative creates a distraction long enough to find other ways to express feelings, or to simply let difficult emotions pass without inflicting harm.</p>
<p>&#8220;An alternative is really a distraction from the impulse so that the person can further process what they&#8217;re thinking, what they&#8217;re feeling, challenging their negative thoughts,&#8221; says Seliner. &#8220;It&#8217;s just creating a window of opportunity so they can think through what other choices and options they have [and] helping them to be able to sit with that uncomfortable feeling, seeing that they can manage it without being self-destructive.&#8221;</p>
<p>The key is building a pause, or window of opportunity, between overwhelming emotions and the impulse to self-injure through harmless distraction-based alternatives. These will be unique for every person, and include activities such as listening to music, reading, cleaning the closet, petting a cat or dog, calling a friend, painting, deep breathing, crafting, collaging, going for a walk, coloring, playing video games, or other similar activities. My list also includes meditation, journaling, drinking tea or hot chocolate, and watching TV.</p>
<p>Alternatives should serve as safe distractions, not substitutes, which will help a person get out of crisis mode and into a place where emotions can be expressed in a healthy manner. Seliner works with clients to create lists of 10 to 15 specific alternatives to use when the impulse to self-injure arises. Lists should be stored somewhere easy to find, such as on a phone, and it may be helpful to have different alternatives for work, home, social situations, or school.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to teach people how to live a productive, healthy life … and we want to teach them how to verbally communicate their feelings in an age-appropriate way as well as to tolerate their feelings,&#8221; says Seliner. &#8220;We believe in a complete cessation of the behavior. We do not believe that any amount of self-injury is healthy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ultimately, alternatives are temporary tools to help self-injurers get the emotional distance they need to process their feelings without taking it out on their body. The goal is to learn to tolerate and express emotions in a healthy, age-appropriate manner and to eradicate the need for self-injury completely. This is the process I am slowly working through.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even when refugees remove themselves from the imminent physical dangers of war zones, their problems are far from over. If refugees relocate to camps within their own country, they often face issues like poverty, and physical and sexual abuse. If they flee abroad, racial and religious discrimination, along with cultural isolation, are often added to their list of woes.</p>
<p>Less talked about than physical and social issues, mental health problems are extremely prevalent in refugee populations, whether they are located in their home country or abroad. Civilian experiences in a war zone can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and physical manifestations of stress like the loss of the ability to move parts of the body. According to a report by the <a href="http://www.irinnews.org/feature/2016/03/09/brain-drain-neglected-mental-health-refugees-europe" target="_blank">German Federal Chamber of Psychotherapists</a>, more than half the number of refugees from war zones suffer from some kind of mental illness.</p>
<p>The Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011 and has so far displaced <a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2016/country-chapters/syria" target="_blank">over 12 million people</a>, with 4 million seeking refuge abroad in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt, has brought about a greater awareness of the mental issues experienced by refugees, especially children. Around half of Syrian refugees are under 18 years old, and around 40 percent are under 12. Three major reports — Save The Children’s March 2017 report, &#8220;<a href="http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/resources/online-library/invisible-wounds" target="_blank">Invisible Wounds</a>,&#8221; the <a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/educational-and-mental-health-needs-syrian-refugee-children" target="_blank">Migration Policy Institute’s (MPI) 2015 report</a>,  and a <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/55f6b90f9.pdf" target="_blank">2015 UNHCR report</a> focus on the mental health issues of Syrian refugees.<span id="more-5865"></span></p>
<p>The three reports range far and wide, and uncover a host of mental health problems faced by refugees. PTSD, a serious condition brought about by the experience of violence or sexual violence, and depression, are particularly prevalent, with 45 percent of Syrian child refugees in Turkey suffering from the former, and 44 percent suffering from the latter.</p>
<p>Grief, over relatives killed in the conflict, material losses, or the situation in general, was a significant source of stress for all. Fear, too, is obviously a stressor. Refugees located in Syria continue to fear violence, while women and girls in camps at home and abroad fear rape and physical abuse. (Fear of rape is a major reason for fleeing war zones in the first place.)</p>
<p>Children are especially at risk from mental illness during wartime, as this quotation from a teacher in the Syrian town of Madaya, in Invisible Wounds, makes clear: “The children are psychologically crushed and tired. When we do activities like singing with them, they don’t respond at all…they draw images of children being butchered in the war, or tanks, or the siege and lack of food.” Another mother talks of the psychological problems of her child who witnessed the beheading of another child by an assailant.</p>
<p>Fear is to be expected, especially as around 3 million Syrian children still live in areas subjected to high explosive weapons. Screaming nightmares are common, as is bedwetting, a symptom of PTSD. But children also become angry and aggressive as a result of their wartime experiences, desiring revenge on those who have murdered their friends or families.</p>
<p>Children also become desensitized to violence, and can be recruited as soldiers for some of the many armed groups in Syria — something which also gives them an income to support their poverty-stricken parents. “Children exposed to multiple sources of violence may become desensitized and emotionally numb, which increases the possibility of them imitating aggressive behavior,” says Save the Children.</p>
<p>For girl refugees, security is an even greater issue, and parents worry about the rape, abduction, or kidnapping of their daughters. This has led to hastily conducted arranged marriages, as parents hope that marriage will provide a greater degree of safety for the girl. Girls as young as 12 have been married off, and this has led to fear, depression, and sometimes even suicide. Fearful parents also won’t allow their daughters to leave their sides, especially in the refugee camps, and the resulting sense of confinement leads to anxiety.</p>
<p>So what can be done, and what is being done? There is a growing realization that aid agencies must take account of refugees’ mental health needs, as well as their physical ones. “We have seen the aftermath of enough civil wars to know this about refugees: providing food and water is not enough,” says the MPI report. For refugees inside Syria, or encamped on its borders, the problem is clear — there are simply not enough mental health practitioners around to give them the help they need.</p>
<p>There are only <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/latest/2016/3/56e2870c9/doctors-face-uphill-task-treat-syrias-mental-wounds.html" target="_blank">about 70 psychiatrists left in Syria</a>. The situation is exacerbated by a Syrian cultural taboo about mental health care that leads to many refugees avoiding help, both inside and outside of the country, although the extent of the Syrian mental health problem has seen attitudes begin to change.</p>
<p>As for refugees abroad, government agencies in the host country should ensure they are diagnosed for mental health issues and treated. For instance, European Union nations must, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/asylum/reception-conditions_en" target="_blank">by law</a>, screen asylum applicants for mental illness, and put in place supportive measures to help them. A lack of resources, however, means that this system often fails.</p>
<p>Along with traditional therapy, measures like art therapy have been used to treat refugees. A Jordan-based organization called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/health/treating-the-trauma-of-young-syrian-refugees.html?_r=0" target="_blank">Syria Bright Future</a> has developed “culturally sensitive” psychological therapy methods of dealing with mental illnesses caused by the war, especially instances of PTSD in children, and these are reportedly having some success.</p>
<p>But, as UNHCR points out, the only way to combat the growing crisis of mental illness for refugees is for the combatants to stop fighting. In Syria, that seemingly is not going to happen in the immediate future and, until then, we must do more to provide mental health services to those who survive the horror in their homeland and brave dangerous journey in search of safety. Otherwise the crisis will have real, irreversible consequences for an entire generation scarred by the trauma of war.</p>
