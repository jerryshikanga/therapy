				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For decades, service members have been placed in incredibly difficult situations domestically and internationally, both on the battleground and beyond.</p>
<p>Some veterans come home from these scenarios with the ability to move past suffering associated with what they’ve experienced, and continue building on their lives with minimal dysfunction to their health. For others, however, the traumatic events they have experienced create a dysfunction that requires professional care, which helps them transition more smoothly to civilian life.</p>
<p><span id="more-11271"></span></p>
<h2>What Mental Health Care is Available to Veterans?</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-Public-Policy/National-Policy-Priorities/Protecting-Veterans-Access-to-Mental-Health-Care" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">National Alliance on Mental Illness</a>, approximately one in five veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan has post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or depression. Further, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) estimates that a third of Vietnam veterans will experience PTSD in their lifetime, and each day, an average of 20 of these veterans die by suicide.</p>
<p>To combat this, the VA has services available that help diagnose and treat veterans with mental health disorders. <a href="https://explore.va.gov/health-care/mental-health" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">These benefits include</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inpatient and outpatient care at VA medical centers</li>
<li>Community-based outpatient treatment services</li>
<li>Vet Center support, including individual and whole-family services, for <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/ptsd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>, military <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/7-self-care-tips-for-sexual-assault-survivors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexual trauma</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/">depression</a>, readjustment, and substance use disorders</li>
</ul>
<h2>Is the Current Coverage Enough?</h2>
<p>According to the VA Disability Rating System, in the year 2000, the average compensation provided to veterans through the disability rating system was nearly $20 billion for 2.3 million veterans. In 2013, that number rose to $54 billion in compensation for 3.5 million veterans. This number has continued to rise in the past five years and will hopefully continue to do so, enabling veterans to receive the compensation and care they deserve. But some question if this is enough.</p>
<p>“Most veterans who need care do not know if they need care, how to get it, whether or not they are eligible or where to go,” said Jagdish Khubchandani, an associate professor of nutrition and health silence at Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana. “While several improvements have happened over the past decade, there are constant challenges with growing numbers of those who need care (a large proportion of those who returned from war in the past two decades have mental health issues).”</p>
<h3>Common Barriers to Care for Veterans</h3>
<p>“To complicate the issue,” Khubchandani continues, “there are staffing and workforce shortages, profound stigma, chronic nature of illnesses requiring long-term attention and follow-up, types of mental health disorders that aren’t familiar to people and often undiagnosed (<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/05/facts-veterans-ptsd/">PTSD, for example</a>), and the co-occurrence of disorders (PTSD and depression, for example).”</p>
<p>Khubchandani added that the tendency to seek care also depends on perceptions about VA health services, the organization of VA, and access factors such as available transportation or distance from and availability of providers.</p>
<p>Other common barriers include a lack of VA staff availability for providing mental health treatment, veterans not trusting the VA or the military to provide services or help because of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/09/therapy-helps-recover-childhood-trauma-abuse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">past trauma</a>, and a lack of providers in the community with experience in treating veterans.</p>
<p>In addition, veterans may believe that therapy may not work, or that if they talk about their past trauma, it will only make them feel worse. Khubchandani added that one of the major problems isn’t veteran specific: there is simply a lack of awareness regarding treatment options for mental health.</p>
<p>If you combine all of these factors, veterans often aren’t receiving the care they require.</p>
<p>“As a country, we have moral, ethical and social reasons for improving mental health and health care for veterans,” Khubchandani said. “For those who aspire to serve the country, this should not be a deterrent or discouraging factor. Individuals with serious mental illness should also get a chance to be treated, recover, and re-enter the community as productive citizens. Eventually, this would create stable families and a more healthy society.”</p>
<h2>Where to Get Help</h2>
<p>Those in the military have been known to take care of their physical health, but in today’s armed forces, mental health is equally essential to mission success and recovery. After all, your mental health is a critical component to your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/therapists-caring-for-their-mental-health/">overall wellbeing</a>. If you are a veteran experiencing mental health challenges, or suspect a family member who is a veteran would benefit from talking to a mental health provider, continue to explore paths to getting help.</p>
<p>The VA is a great place to start and <a href="https://explore.va.gov/health-care/mental-health" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">check coverage</a> that’s available, but know there are alternatives. Confidential counselors are available for service members and their families via Military One Source (1-800-342-9647), and primary care and behavioral health care providers can help point you in the right direction.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feeling “stuck” is an awful feeling. Stuck can quickly turn to feeling hopeless and helpless. When you can’t achieve the things that you want, the internal dialogue can quickly turn to criticism and self-blame. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to make some important changes in your life, here are some thoughts to get you unstuck.</p>
<p><span id="more-11255"></span></p>
<h2>It All Starts With Self-Reflection</h2>
<p>Getting your life unstuck can be a big challenge, and it always starts with a bit of self-reflection and exploration. In order to move forward you’re going to have to slow down and take stock of your life first. This means that you should set aside some time for quiet reflection without input and feedback from others. This can be hard to do with competing priorities and responsibilities, but it’s a necessary step.</p>
<p>When you sit down to reflect, ask yourself the following:“</p>
<ul>
<li>Where am I now?</li>
<li>What is my life like?</li>
<li>Am I doing the work that I hoped that I would do?</li>
<li>Are my relationships succeeding?</li>
<li>How would I want them to be better?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s imperative that you be as specific as possible, and to explore with a curious, non-judgemental mind. There are no right or wrong answers here! Being vague and broad with what you want will not only leave you feeling worse, but also make it difficult for you to take concrete action later on. It’s hard to problem-solve when you don’t know the actual problem, isn’t it?</p>
<h2>Reconnect Your Purpose</h2>
<p>Often when we can’t move forward, it means that we’re <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/08/dear-therapist-how-do-i-find-my-purpose-in-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">missing purpose</a> and inspiration. From an existential perspective, we need purpose as humans. That purpose could be quite broad (working to reduce instances of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/10/breast-cancer-diagnosis-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancer</a>) but could also be smaller (to help support my team at work). Each purpose is valuable and valid, no matter what it is.</p>
<p>Take some time to explore what you have been most passionate about in the past. Ask yourself, “What motivates me?” or “What has driven some of my decisions so far?” Those questions might help you identify a purpose that you’ve long been disconnected from.</p>
<h2>Take a Peek into the Future</h2>
<p>As a therapist, I’ve worked with many clients who have come into the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">therapy</a> space feeling stuck or confused about their path in life. One of the exercises that I find most helpful is an envisioning exercise. For some, looking into the ideal future can be very informative.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling stuck, try to imagine your life 10 years from now. Think about where you will be living, who you will be with, what you’ll be doing, etc. Create a mental picture of what that ideal life could look like. Maybe that’s what your heart desires!</p>
<p>Once you take a peek into the future then you might be able to start crafting a rough outline to get there. And remember, even if you pivot or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/fear-of-change-why-life-adjustments-are-difficult/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change directions</a> several times (most people do!) you still have made some progress.</p>
<h2>Try Something New</h2>
<p>Often, when we feel like we are in a rut, it’s an indication that something needs to change. Sometimes we don’t even know what that change is. When you don’t have insight into what needs to change, it can be helpful to try something new. Anything out of the ordinary, or that breaks your current routine, might give you some helpful guidance toward your next steps.</p>
<p>This could mean reading a new book for pleasure (which maybe you haven’t done in a while) or attending an event you wouldn’t normally attend. Taking a moment to step outside of yourself can jostle your system into feeling something new. Reacting to new stimuli might also leave you feeling inspired, and able to connect to a part of yourself that has long been forgotten.</p>
<p>Sometimes trying something new can be the catalyst for other changes in your life.</p>
<h2>Work With a Therapist</h2>
<p>If you’ve tried out some of the suggestions in this article and still can’t find your way out of the rut, it may be helpful to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/08/why-working-with-a-therapist-is-different-than-talking-to-a-friend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work with a therapist</a> to help you examine what’s holding you back. Seeking support isn’t an indictment of weakness or incapability. Having an outside, professional perspective might help you get to the bottom of your “stuck-ness” and help you craft a plan to move forward.</p>
<p>In my work, I’ve often met with clients who have tried many things on their own but found themselves frustrated with their change process. Change is quite difficult! Sometimes this can lead to feelings of self-doubt and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/negative-thinking-got-you-down-heres-how-to-shift-your-thoughts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative self-talk</a> which may exacerbate ongoing mental health issues. If you have any doubt about your ability to move forward, consulting with a therapist will be insightful and help you identify and work through the barriers without judgement and self-criticism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number of individuals experiencing mental illness around the world continues to grow. Characterized by what people experience in their mind, but sometimes involving physical symptoms, and their emotional well-being, the cause of many mental health disorders is yet to be discovered. Many of the symptoms are scientifically understood, however.</p>
<p>Below you’ll find a high-level overview of the most common mental illnesses as well as common treatments. The list is by no means exhaustive, but is meant to be a guide to frequently occurring conditions, some of which can present simultaneously.</p>
<p><span id="more-11159"></span></p>
<h2><b>Depression</b></h2>
<p>Impacting an estimated <a href="http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-disorders" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">300 million people</a>, depression is the most-common mental disorder and generally affects women more often than men. It is often characterized by loss of interest or pleasure, general sadness, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, difficulty falling asleep, eating pattern changes, exhaustion and a lack of concentration. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/dealing-depression-need-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Depression</a> doesn’t just arise as a result of “too much” or “too few” brain chemicals, specifically serotonin, as it is often depicted. Rather, <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/what-causes-depression" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">several forces</a> such as genetics, life events, medical problems and medications can bring the illness on.</p>
<p>Because depression can present as both long-lasting or as recurring, depression can severely interfere with a person’s ability to function at work or school and can have a negative impact on relationships. At its most severe state, depression can lead to suicidal thoughts and actions. To effectively treat depression in some cases, cognitive behavior therapy, psychotherapy and antidepressant medication can be valuable.</p>
<p><a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/online-therapy-with-a-licensed-therapist?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_MID&amp;utr_content=affordable&amp;utr_adgroup=midpost-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=11159&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/10/the-top-five-most-common-mental-illnesses/&amp;var=promo-b&amp;partner=Talkspace%20Blog&amp;code=BLOG45" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4880 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png" alt="affordable blog purchase CTA" width="660" height="240" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png 660w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a></p>
<h2><b>Anxiety</b></h2>
<p>It is not uncommon for a person experiencing depression to also have anxiety (and vice versa), a disorder that affects <a href="https://adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statistics" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">40 million adults</a> in the U.S., or 18.1 percent of the population, every year. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/when-does-normal-anxiety-become-a-mental-illness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anxiety disorders </a>develop from a multitude of factors, including genetics, brain chemistry and life events, and while it is a highly treatable illness, only 36.9 percent of those who live with anxiety actually seek out treatment, and ultimately, access it. Psychotherapy and medication play an important role in helping to control and manage the symptoms of anxiety, .</p>
<h2><b>Bipolar Affective Disorder</b></h2>
<p>Engendering both manic and depressive episodes, sometimes book-ended, and sometimes featuring moments of “normal” or stabilized mood, this illness impacts approximately <a href="http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-disorders" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">60 million people</a> worldwide. Manic episodes can contain elevated or irritable mood, hyperactivity, inflated self-esteem and a lack of desire to sleep. Hypomania are a less severe form of mania. Depressive episodes are often characterized by feelings of extreme sadness, hopelessness, little energy, and trouble sleeping. While the cause of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/know-kind-bipolar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bipolar</a> is not entirely known, a mixture of genetic, neurochemical and environmental factors can play a role in the progression of the illness, which can be treated through medication and psychosocial support.</p>
<h2><b>Schizophrenia and Other Psychoses</b></h2>
<p>Psychoses, including <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/what-is-schizophrenia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">schizophrenia</a>, is a severe mental illness impacting about <a href="http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-disorders" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">23 million </a>people worldwide and is characterized by distortions in thinking, perception, emotions, sense of self, and behavior. Those who have these illnesses can experience hallucinations and delusions starting in late adolescence or early adulthood, making it difficult for people to work, study, or interact socially. Due to stigma and discrimination, many who experience these mental illnesses do not have access to adequate health and social support (sometimes leading to housing insecurity), which could help treat the disorder.</p>
<h2><b>Dementia</b></h2>
<p>Dementia is generally chronic or progressive in nature and entails a deterioration of cognitive function beyond normal aging, impacting about <a href="http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-disorders" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">50 million people </a>across the globe. From memory, orientation and thinking, to comprehension, calculation, and language, the decline in cognitive function is generally met with deterioration in emotional and social control. Dementia is caused by a variety of diseases that impact the brain, and there is currently no cure available, but there are palliative treatments designed to ease the suffering and confusion of the sufferer.</p>
<p>Mental health illnesses are a global issue that touches nearly every person in some way — and these are just a few of the most commonly documented. While every situation is unique, there are treatment and recovery options available to help an individual achieve strength and support. Taking the time to recognize your symptoms and get an accurate diagnosis can help best determine the most appropriate <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mental-illness/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374974" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">treatment</a> — be it be pharmaceutical intervention or treatment plan involving psychotherapy with a licensed therapist.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is human nature to compare yourself to others, whether favorably or unfavorably. Favorable comparisons enhance self-esteem and make people feel better about their life circumstances, while continually comparing yourself negatively to others can have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>People compare themselves to others in all arenas of life. Mental health is no exception. Unfortunately, comparing your own mental health issues to those of your friends, family, colleagues, or celebrities can lead to a worsened emotional state. Here are three ways that people compare their mental illness to others’, and the negative effects of these comparisons.</p>
<p><span id="more-11153"></span></p>
<h2><b>When You Compare Your Mental Illness to Others With the Same Mental Illness, It Can Make You Feel Inadequate</b></h2>
<p>It is wonderful that people like Mariah Carey “come out” as having <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/know-kind-bipolar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bipolar disorder</a>, because it destigmatizes mental illness. However, celebrities being open about their mental health issues can be a double edged sword. Most human beings have not accomplished as much in their lives as a star like Mariah Carey, and if your own struggles with bipolar disorder have not been set against a backdrop of fame and fortune. It is easy to think that you are a failure <i>even</i> at having a mental illness! It is a similar result if you struggle with depression and hear about your brother-in-law with depression who still manages to make six figures and travel to exotic locations.</p>
<h2><b>It&#8217;s Easy to Compare One Mental Illness to Another and Think You’ve Gotten the Short End of the Stick</b></h2>
<p>As sad as it may be to admit, many people have often joked about how “lucky” they would be if they just had the “willpower” of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/01/how-therapy-subtly-reveals-whether-you-have-an-eating-disorder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anorexia</a>. Often, clients with bulimia or binge <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/01/how-therapy-subtly-reveals-whether-you-have-an-eating-disorder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eating disorder</a> feel this way. Similarly, people with constant depression may wish that they had the supposed respite and euphoria that mania would provide. This thinking is dangerous, not only because these conditions are wildly disparate, but also because each comes with its own tremendous challenges. No one who actually suffer from one of these disorders would wish them on anyone else.</p>

<h2><b>Others’ Recoveries May Feel Faster Than Your Own</b></h2>
<p>Support groups, whether online or in person, can be fantastic sources of help and comfort for those struggling with mental illness. However, they can also provide comparison points that aren’t very useful. Everyone starting out in a support group feels like they will never be 100 days sober, or months past their last binge, or socializing again, or whatever is the focus of their group.</p>
<p>If any of these resonate with you, it is integral to recognize the negative impact of comparisons on your mental health, and on your recovery. Everyone’s mental health journey is different, and no two individuals have the same path to emotional health.</p>
<p>Often, we see what others want us to see, or we don’t see the meandering path that led to their recovery. The brother-in-law who is a successful banker may have taken years to get through college, or even dropped out. The celebrity with a history of mental illness may have had horrible downturns in her life that you would not envy, even for a taste of her fame. Thinking about how little you actually know about others’ lives can help you maintain objectivity in the face of envy and shame.</p>
<p>Similarly, whatever meeting you go to for the first time, you will likely be the least far along your recovery journey — the first step is always the furthest from the finish. Instead of dwelling on that, why not visualize yourself in a few months, being one of the group members who is furthest along their recovery path, and who can be a resource and guide for others on the same journey.</p>
<p>Comparisons that make you feel dejected and inferior are never good for you. Everyone has an individual mental health path to walk, and focusing on your own place on that path is much more helpful than looking around at others. Working with a therapist can often ground you, and help you recognize your own unique strengths, instead of making comparisons between yourself and others.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I lived most of my life in shame of who I was — diagnosed with conditions I’d never share even with some of my closest friends. Labels I’d never <i>dare</i> think about wearing across my chest or around my neck out of embarrassment. But now, these same labels I avoided for years have become <i>*deep inhale*</i> A FASHION STATEMENT! <i>*sharp exhale* </i>What in the world has changed?</p>
<p><span id="more-11143"></span></p>
<h2>Fashionable or Exploitation?</h2>
<p>To be honest, I’ve had conflicting feelings about brands coming out with mental health-themed tee shirts, tote bags, jewelry, and so on. It goes hand in hand with the fact that, these days, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/12/is-talking-about-your-mental-health-trendy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talking about mental health is trendy</a>. Sure, there’s an upside to it — by talking about it, we’re making mental illness less taboo&#8230;but is the general population’s view on mental illness <i>actually</i> changing, or is the stigma still alive and well? Are brands small and large capitalizing on mental illness — trading on people’s suffering — hoping to make a quick buck off of something trendy?</p>
<p>This all goes hand in hand with the fact that depression and “sad girl” culture is popular on the internet, and <a href="https://themighty.com/2018/03/stop-romanticizing-mental-illness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental illness — even suicide — is glamorized</a>. It all seems to be contradictory. Even though mental illness is still widely misunderstood by the masses, and people will label someone with depression as a “psycho” and steer clear of them, they’ll happily buy — and wear — a tee that reads, “Cute But Psycho” and post selfies in it on Instagram. I’ve seen this phrase in particular make its way from specialty retailers and department stores to fast fashion purveyors and even Etsy.</p>
<p>I remember seeing that shirt for the first time and thinking it was good fun. Then, I started wondering — why does someone want to call themself a psycho? I get it, the shirts are cute. But <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/mental-health-conditions-shouldnt-pejorative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">psycho is a pejorative</a> used too often to describe people with even slightest mental illness. Depressed? Wow, she&#8217;s a psycho! Anxiety disorder? Psycho! Anyone who’s been called psycho can tell you that it’s not cute — it’s hurtful. It’s also horribly disrespectful to people who actually suffer from psychosis, a serious condition that has profound consequences for those who deal with the illness.</p>
<p>And it doesn’t stop there. Mental illness has wended its way into fashion as shirts that talk about mental health and don’t give back any proceeds to charity. It presents itself as “dad hats” on sale for $5 at Forever 21 that say “Sad Girls,” because, yeah, that’s totally what someone with depression wants on their forehead. Thankfully, it also sometimes presents itself as <a href="https://www.bando.com/pages/feel-better-jen-gotch-x-iconery" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">a necklace that gives back 100% of proceeds to charity. </a></p>
<p><a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/online-therapy-with-a-licensed-therapist?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_MID&amp;utr_content=affordable&amp;utr_adgroup=midpost-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=11143&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/10/trust-me-having-…isnt-fashionable/&amp;var=promo-b&amp;partner=Talkspace%20Blog&amp;code=BLOG45" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4880 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png" alt="affordable blog purchase CTA" width="660" height="240" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png 660w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a></p>
<h2>Impact on Those with Mental Illness</h2>
<p>I spoke to a couple mental illness sufferers to get their opinions on the merging of fashion and mental illness to see how they felt about it. “I f***ing hate it,” confessed 28 year old Ian*, a musician who has been battling depression for years. “In the beginning, I was all for it, but now it’s clear that people are exploiting [the mental health community] to cash in and get popular. It hasn’t done anything to the stigma&#8230;It’s all a facade.”</p>
<p>27 year old Carly*, an art director who suffers from depression and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/when-does-normal-anxiety-become-a-mental-illness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a>, shares a similar sentiment. “I think it’s nice that people want to be proud to fight the stigma, but it feels weird if people without the diagnosis want to CHOOSE to wear a label I <i>don’t</i> choose to have without carrying any of the consequence of it,” she said. “It’s not a fashion statement because no one thinks it’s cool or trendy to walk around crying or collapsing in public during a panic attack.” As someone who has walked the streets crying, I can tell you, people definitely <i>do not </i>look at you like you’re cool when you do so. In fact, they avoid you like the plague.</p>
<p>“I heard a speaker talk once about how people rally around those with cancer but don’t offer any similar concern towards those with mental illness whether it be more mild or at the level of hospitalization,” Carly continued. “Support is so important! And i think it’s easy to show that outside of buying a product that says ‘DEPRESSION’ on it. I feel like that kind of thing almost makes light of it as a less serious issue.”</p>
<p>Ashley*, a 27 year old photographer who suffers from anxiety, has mixed views on the issue. “I think it’s a double-edged sword. On one hand, there is awareness being put to the forefront and making people question what mental illnesses are. It helps those who do have mental illnesses find comfort knowing something that has been taboo since forever is now becoming more acceptable.” She then added, “But when you have brands that you know are just using mental illness to reap the benefits because it’s ‘trendy,’ that’s where the problem lies. Mental illness isn’t a trend. It isn’t something that will come and go for those of us who suffer.”</p>
<h2>Acceptance is Its Own Statement</h2>
<p>Mental illness is <i>hard</i>! For many of us, it isn’t just something that comes and goes in our lives. It’s not something we buy and then throw in a bag to donate to Goodwill two seasons later. My <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/dealing-depression-need-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depression</a> is not a graphic tee shirt. My anxiety is not a necklace. They’re mental illnesses I might be dealing with for the rest of my life. With time, I’ve finally grown to accept my diagnoses, and even become proud of who I am today. But is it a fashion statement? No. It’s a part of me. It’s a part of the daily struggle that many mental illness sufferers deal with. And to them, it’s not a fashion statement either. Trust me.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>While Talkspace is not available to people under 18-years-old, we recognize the importance of providing support for the parents of children with mental health issues.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m no stranger to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a> and mental health help. Long before I faced my own mental health issues, my mother passed down stories of my grandmother, who spent most of her life battling the demons of drug-induced psychosis and what, in retrospect, seems to have been borderline personality disorder.</p>
<p>Later, my mother also opened up about her own struggles with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxiety</a>, and the post-traumatic stress she carried from her abusive childhood. Likewise, my oldest sister, my father, and many of my family friends talked frankly about their issues.</p>
<p>Naturally, this has a downside: there’s nothing like being six-years-old and realizing everybody around you has some serious issues. But it also offers some benefits. Mainly, I didn’t have to deal with the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/stigma/" target="_blank">stigma</a> when the time came for me to seek help for my own problems.</p>
<p>As you’ll see, by the time I was facing true despair, I’d already had years of experience with mental health professionals. My story will enlighten you on the experience of seeing a therapist while you’re still growing up and what we can accomplish for our children.<span id="more-5707"></span></p>
<h2>A Head Start in Mental Health</h2>
<p>Let’s go back to the fourth grade. It all started when my parents got divorced. Because broken homes can lead to broken spirits, one of the recommendations for dissolving a marriage is to get your kids looked at. They sent me to the counselor at my elementary school.</p>
<p>I didn’t necessarily want to see the counselor. It wasn’t that I didn’t like her, but rather that she always wanted to see me when we were working on science projects, which was one of the few subjects I actually enjoyed.</p>
<p>She was nice though. Her room was dark, quiet, and calm. Sometimes she played ambient music. I remember playing with dinosaurs in the small sandbox she kept on her table and naming each of them. For the most part, we talked about how I was doing in school, my friends, my weekend plans, and what my parents were telling me — especially about each other.</p>
<p>I remember explaining how I had to choose whether I was going to live with my mom or my dad. She asked me whether I&#8217;d decided. My answer was along the lines of, &#8220;My dad lets me eat Cheetos for dinner sometimes…but I love my mom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon after, partly on the recommendation of the counselor, the court allowed me to choose my own adventure. I moved to Alabama with my mom, the divorce was finalized, I was declared undamaged, and my counseling sessions ended.</p>
<h2>The Mental Breakdown</h2>
<p>The next couple years ran smoothly, but I had my first depressive episode in the eighth grade. My mom wasn&#8217;t sure what was wrong with me. Ironically, the woman who&#8217;d dealt with depression all her life, and taught me to have compassion for those dealing with the illness, didn&#8217;t know what to do with me.</p>
<p>Depression hit, my grades dropped, and I didn&#8217;t want to do anything other than listen to Evanescence and cry in my bedroom. She responded by grounding me from my CD player.</p>
<p>A couple years later, the hormonal teenage angst swung into a full blown manic episode. On the recommendation of the school nurse, I started working with my second therapist around the time I started seeing monsters and having <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/anxiety-attack-vs-panic-attack-one/" target="_blank">panic attacks</a>.</p>
<p>This was my introduction to having my mental health taken seriously. In fact, it was the first time a professional took me more seriously than I did. At the time, I didn’t figure anything was wrong with me other than a lack of sleep and a bit of moodiness. All the best people are mercurial, I thought.</p>
<p>The first time I saw a psychiatrist, I spoke to him for more than an hour. My mom was in the room with me, listening to my experiences and my issues. I watched the weight of the situation slowly sinking into her face. At the end of the appointment, he diagnosed me with Bipolar Disorder Type I with psychotic features. I was placed on a mix of medication and scheduled a two-week follow-up. He also recommended I enroll in talk therapy.</p>
<p>I initially refused to seek out a therapist. Part of me felt like other people needed help more than I did, and I didn’t want to waste the resources. The rest of me was just resistant and antisocial.</p>
<p>It turned out, I didn’t have much of a choice.</p>
<p>A couple weeks after my meeting with the psychiatrist, I was cordially invited to meet with the school counselor after submitting an account of how my suicide would play out to the school literary magazine.</p>
<p>For a brief time, I felt like a hot potato. I was gently forced into a meeting with the counselor. After listening to me for about three minutes, however, she stated — in the kindest way possible — that I was beyond the scope of her training. She referred me to the resident school psychologist.</p>
<h2>The Good Doctor</h2>
<p>My first meeting with the psychologist was a few days later. He listened to me talk, nodding and smiling the entire time, before telling me he&#8217;d like to talk with me at least once per week. I told him I was almost failing my math class anyways and asked to keep our appointments to that time slot. He obliged. I would never miss science class.</p>
<p>His office was small, cramped, and a bit underwhelming. Although my school was relatively well-funded, the mental health program wasn&#8217;t. My psychologist worked two half-days each week between running his own practice.</p>
<p>For our second appointment, I chose to say absolutely nothing to him for fifteen minutes before informing him that I’d taken up bulimia as a hobby. His response was the right mix of sarcasm and serious: “That’s the worst way to have your cake and eat it, too.” I decided to start working with him as constructively as I could.</p>
<p>Generally, we met for about an hour. It felt more like talking with a friend than actual therapy. We had conversations rather than lectures. I felt like I could be honest with him. Something told me he didn’t judge me. He understood where I was coming from. He empathized.</p>
<p>His influence was so powerful that he didn’t only help me survive that period of my life. He also informed how I interact with people today as a friend, an advocate for battered women, and as a son to my mother, who still struggles with her illnesses every day.</p>
<p>I still value his unique contribution to my life. I also wish people like him were more common.</p>
<h2>Committing to the Cause</h2>
<p>When we talk about children’s mental health and learning to help them cope with trauma or mental illness, we become a bit misguided. Naturally, we need to address issues like stigma, lack of resources, and the challenges of working with a child’s brain to repair any damage before it becomes a long-term problem.</p>
<p>But we also need to see mental health work as an opportunity. Therapy should not only be about reacting to a breakdown and restoring someone to normal. Rather, we should aim to transform the people around us and empower them to grow beyond who they were when they started to have the issues. It’s even easier to accomplish this when we take the time to talk about children’s mental health.</p>
