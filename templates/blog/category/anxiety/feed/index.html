				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For some, the end of the year is a dreaded time — performance review season. Even if you don’t work in a professional setting that holds annual reviews, you know your aunt will have some feedback about how you’re living your life at an upcoming holiday gathering.</p>
<p>And receiving that kind of criticism — good or bad — can make you anxious.</p>
<p><span id="more-11385"></span></p>
<h2>Why Feedback Makes Us Anxious</h2>
<p>According to Kimberly Leitch, a licensed clinical social worker and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/3-therapists-open-work-talkspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Talkspace therapist</a> based in New York, receiving feedback can be <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a> provoking because it is a situation where you are being judged by someone, most likely in a position of authority.</p>
<p>“When you are sitting with someone who is going to evaluate your performance it can induce <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/can-you-be-addicted-to-stress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stress</a>, as the anticipation can cause you to think negative thoughts, question yourself, or even second guess yourself,” she said. “This can be the case whether you believe that you have room for improvement or do exceptional work. The thought of being judged by someone who can make decisions about or impact your growth and direction can weigh very heavily.”</p>
<p>The best way to overcome this, Leitch suggests, is to try to maintain a positive attitude, think positively, and prepare as much as you can.</p>
<p>“Focus on what you would say about yourself; think about your work ethic and the good qualities that you come with,” she said. “If it is a situation where you are evaluated, then prepare to talk about your positive qualities and how you feel you are an asset and why <i>you</i> would like to hire you.”</p>
<h2>Receiving Feedback with Less Anxiety</h2>
<p>If feedback gives you anxiety — or at minimum, butterflies — you’re likely looking for ways to alleviate that dreadful feeling. Below are five additional tips to receive feedback with dignity, grace, and less anxiety.</p>
<h3>1. Try not to react</h3>
<p>Before you do anything internally or externally, take a quiet moment. Allow your brain to process the situation, and take a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/03/how-you-can-beat-anxiety-with-mindful-breathing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep breath</a>. The few seconds you take to do this can stop a dismissive facial expression and keep your rush of emotions at bay.</p>
<h3>2. Don’t be surprised if good news is tough to receive</h3>
<p>“Good news can make you anxious because it may come with something you didn’t expect,” Leitch said.</p>
<p>“For example, if you are <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/07/the-dirty-lowdown-on-anticipatory-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meeting with a supervisor</a> and they tell you what a great employee you are, they may want to give you additional responsibilities that you weren’t prepared for. They may want to move you out of your comfort zone into something more challenging and stressful then you are used to.”</p>
<h3>3. Ask questions to clarify</h3>
<p>Since the lack of control and unknowns that accompany feedback are what can trigger anxiety, it’s important to try and gain control and better understand what is being communicated.</p>
<p>Ask questions to make sure that you understand what is being said. Focus on understanding the feedback you are receiving, not on your emotions or your next response.</p>
<h3>4. Take time to process the feedback</h3>
<p>“After receiving your feedback, let it sink in and allow yourself some time to think about it,” Leitch said.</p>
<p>“Good or bad it may be useful information for you. It may open you up to a new or different perspective that you were unable to see. It may provide insight and how you are perceived by others. It may not affect you, or it may give you the opportunity to change in ways you normally wouldn’t have thought to.”</p>
<h3>5. Separate feedback from judgment</h3>
<p>As Leitch mentioned, one of the reasons feedback makes us anxious is because we equate it with judgment.</p>
<p>To keep calm, remind yourself that the feedback you receive is not a judgment on your ability or personality. It’s simply advice on how to improve, or a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/10/taking-a-compliment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compliment</a> on something you are already excelling in. Reframing your perception this way can make you more open to hearing opinions on your performance, actions, or behavior, and less fearful of failure.</p>
<h2>Receiving Feedback Helps Us Grow</h2>
<p>Feedback is important and it can strengthen a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relationship</a>. Knowing that another person (who is likely close to you and maybe someone you respect) is going to tell it to you straight creates and builds trust. It’s one of the only ways we can learn about our strengths and weaknesses — without this knowledge we can’t improve.</p>
<p>When you let feedback make you anxious, you only add stress to your life and run the risk of missing out on important insights. While feedback isn’t easy to give or receive, being better prepared to hear it can make a difference in your personal life and professional performance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Balancing happiness while dealing with anxiety can sometimes add even more anxiety. Why? The feeling both exhilarates and terrifies you. Mostly, it&#8217;s downright confusing, because even when you think you should be at your best, your body might not be responding the same.</p>
<p><span id="more-11209"></span></p>
<p>You may enter the &#8220;what if&#8221; spiral: What if I don&#8217;t deserve it? What if the new job that makes me so happy falls through, and I&#8217;m back to square one? What if anxiety strikes and I self-sabotage? What if I get blamed for my paralyzing anxiety? What if I just got lucky?</p>
<p>Maybe you cry to let it out, but it keeps coming back because that&#8217;s what anxiety does. However, you don&#8217;t have to let anxiety interfere with the good things that happen to you. The best thing to do is understand why anxiety is trying to sabotage you and take steps to combat it.</p>
<h2>Are You Afraid to Be Happy?</h2>
<p>Why can happiness skyrocket your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/">anxiety</a> levels? It comes down to a fear of happiness.</p>
<p>Researchers use a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/codes-joy/201405/is-fear-happiness-real" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">“fear of happiness” scale</a> to determine correlations between happiness levels and fear of something bad occurring. There were a few key findings.</p>
<p>Perfectionists can fear happiness because they may associate that time with unproductive activity. Many people, even absent anxiety, experience this type of association and tend to remember stressful or unfortunate experiences more clearly than good times. A common depression symptom involves sufferers socially withdrawing from activities that could bring happiness, but it reinforces the worry that that eventual joy could lead to a letdown.</p>
<p>Afraid to let yourself down? You may not know how to handle your anxiety when life circumstances change. In this mode of thinking, your brain races back and forth between the feelings of happiness and potential for growth, and the fear of change, worries of self-sabotage, and wanting to stay where you are. Talk about feeling stuck between a rock and a hard place!</p>
<h2>Anxiety Exhausts You</h2>
<p>When things are going well, you may feel like you’re running on fumes because you’re expending more physical, mental, and emotional energy to pursue and achieve your goal. Typically, this isn’t an issue if it’s helping us fulfill our basic and professional needs. However, it can start to affect your health and mental wellbeing if you work too hard to reach our goals.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that maintaining a work-life balance is critical to mental health. Researchers note that working <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/15/is-28-hours-ideal-working-week-for-healthy-life" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">over 39 hours poses a risk to your well-being</a>, and overwork boosts the risk of stroke by five times. The standard workday actually increases your risk of premature death, along with a higher likelihood of anxiety and depression. While <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/mental-health-workout-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exercise</a> helps, more people need to stand up for a real work-life balance when pursuing your goals and when life is going well.</p>
<h2>Understand Your Body and Give It the Best</h2>
<p>Accomplishments and positive life events can be stressful because they often bring more responsibility. When happiness strikes, you need to give your body the best environment possible to succeed and feel supported.</p>
<p>Many people rely on coffee to push through important work, but coffee can give you the “jitters” and negatively affect your sleep. Take it easy on the stimulants by <a href="https://www.psycom.net/anxiety-and-caffeine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">limiting yourself to 400 milligrams</a> per day, or one to four cups. Four cups may still be too much, but if you find you can handle it, do what makes you feel best. Delay your first cup, and take it with protein to lessen the impact of those jitters.</p>
<p>A 2014 study looked at bacteria from 55 participants and discovered depressive patients were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/magazine/can-the-bacteria-in-your-gut-explain-your-mood.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">more likely to have certain bacteria</a>. Further research found that a Lactobacillus rhamnosus-enriched broth made despairing mice swim longer, offering more insight into <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/ways-stomach-microbiome-impacts-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how gut biome affects our mental state</a>. Healthy bacteria increases levels of GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter that decreases stress.</p>
<p>While celebrating your victories make a healthy meal plan for the week ahead. Focus on good fats, such as avocado and olive oil, and fermented foods, like kimchi and yogurt, which add good gut bacteria to your diet.</p>
<h2>Find a Good Sounding Board</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s OK to ask for help, even when things are going well. Friends and loved ones may not understand why you’d seek help when you’re at your peak, but they will let go of assumptions if they truly want you to succeed.</p>
<p>In addition to learning to delegate, you can take any stress off your plate and hire an expert to talk to. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/10/how-to-find-a-therapist-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Find a therapist</a> or counselor that is a good fit, gives you tools to work through problems, and offers you the space to talk through everything. Once you sound off, they can help you find the validation you need within yourself.</p>
<h2>Some Stress is Good Stress, but Don’t Let Anxiety Go Unchecked</h2>
<p>It sounds counter intuitive, but even when things are going well you may have to make an effort to keep showing up as the best you. You’ll still feel valuable and find meaning in what you do on a day-to-day basis, even if you have to go at a slower pace or shake up your routine.</p>
<p>Change is inevitable and good change preferable to bad. Anxiety likes to barge in, but just make sure to give yourself a positive environment and a little reinforcement. Even better, you may find, over time, that you’ll be happy, productive, and more than just OK with that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all know truly passionate people in our lives. They’re the ones who fully embrace their calling, vocation, or dream and pursue it daily with a mixture of enthusiasm and discipline. There’s the all-star athlete who balances a rigorous training, practice, and game schedule. Or the food blogger who carves out time late after the kids have gone to bed to dive into recipe preparation, writing, and photo editing. And there’s the activist who’s passionate about helping others and logs long hours at a homeless shelter after a full day at the office.</p>
<p>When we’re passionate about an activity, cause, or talent, we’ll do whatever it takes to devote ourselves fully to it, which is exactly why the admirable work of pursuing our passions can slowly ramp up symptoms of anxiety.</p>
<p><span id="more-11168"></span></p>
<h2>Time Limitations</h2>
<p>We only have 24 hours in each day to pack in a host of demands related to work, relationships, and home life. The<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-power-slow/200911/how-can-we-keep-in-fast-paced-world" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> pace of life</a> is increasing, but the reality is, there’s only so much time to fit it all in. When going after your passions, you have to weave in extra commitments amid other priorities, but that means something else must drop off. If it doesn’t, life quickly becomes out of balance, increasing feelings of stress and ultimately, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/how-to-get-rid-of-anxiety-separating-good-bad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a>.</p>
<p>In Randi Zuckerberg’s book,<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pick-Three-Have-Just-Every/dp/B079YBF8SF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> <i>Pick Three</i></a>, she advocates for choosing three focus areas for a single day from this list of five: work, sleep, family, friends, and fitness. There are many other<a href="https://www.toolshero.com/time-management/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> time management theories</a>, so do your research and choose one that lets you pursue your passions without chipping away at your mental health.</p>
<h2>Internal Pressure</h2>
<p>When taking risks and striving toward our goals, it’s tempting to feel the weight of other’s opinions and expectations. But sometimes, our harshest critic — and biggest enemy — is ourselves. We’re not born<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/emotion-information/201805/why-do-i-feel-so-inadequate" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> feeling inadequate</a>, but many worry that they’re just not good enough. When we place high expectations on ourselves, we can start a<a href="https://www.healthyplace.com/blogs/anxiety-schmanxiety/2013/02/let-go-of-anxiety-by-letting-go-of-expectations" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> “spin cycle of anxiety”</a> that starts with feeling inadequate, that things are out of control, and that you can’t handle them. You may also experience stomach aches, chest tightness, shortness of breath, nausea, or panic.</p>
<p>War against high expectations when chasing after your passions by setting realistic, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/12/getting-2018-smart-goals-mental-health-resolutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SMART goals</a> with attainable benchmarks that allow you to step back and celebrate your accomplishments. Remember, it’s a marathon, not a sprint.</p>
<p><a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/online-therapy-with-a-licensed-therapist?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_MID&amp;utr_content=affordable&amp;utr_adgroup=midpost-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=11168&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/10/why-pursuing-your-passions-can-increase-anxiety/&amp;var=promo-b&amp;partner=Talkspace%20Blog&amp;code=BLOG45" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4880 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png" alt="affordable blog purchase CTA" width="660" height="240" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png 660w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a></p>
<h2>Strong Self-Identity</h2>
<p>Strongly identifying with your passion and internalizing this as who you are — like a writer, marathon runner, or Fortune 500 executive — creates even more pressure as you work to live up to that standard. Virginia-based Talkspace therapist Cynthia Catchings, LCSW-S, notes that while most people envision rising to the top of the field they’re passionate about, only a select few can successfully manage the anxiety that comes along with it.</p>
<p>“The more challenges and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/negative-thinking-got-you-down-heres-how-to-shift-your-thoughts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative thoughts</a> we experience, the more difficult it can be to get to the top without feeling anxious,” Catchings said. “Fear of failure, not wanting to leave our comfort zone, or being a perfectionist can create this anxiety.”</p>
<p>Seeing yourself holistically, beyond your token passion, can help create other opportunities for fulfillment. Beyond a marathon runner, you may also be a wellness coach, son or daughter, or another role that you excel at.</p>
<h2>A Recipe for Burnout</h2>
<p>On the path to our passions, where we continuously push ourselves physically and emotionally, there’s an increased risk of burnout and stress. The brain, just like a muscle, can<a href="https://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/symptoms/tiredness" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> lose its strength</a> from extreme exhaustion and overwork, which paves the way for a host of mental health challenges, including anxiety. Health professionals are beginning to recognize the impact of chronic stress, with some even<a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/3639388/burnout-syndrome-symptoms-stress/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> comparing burnout to diseases</a> like diabetes.</p>
<p>Catchings recommends creating a detailed plan of action to effectively handle the emotions that arise with our passions and the associated feelings of stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>“Keep a journal to avoid bottling our emotions and also to see a clear picture of our accomplishments and the things we need to work on, deep breathing exercises or meditation to lower the anxiety, mindfulness to recognize our emotions and be able to process them as needed, and looking for professional help either by seeing a therapist in person or online,” she said.</p>
<p>Pursuing your passions doesn’t have to come with a barrage of anxiety or stress. Create checks and balances to effectively manage your schedule and more importantly, your mental health, to keep you on track for living out your dreams.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My adult life could be easily divided into two very distinct segments: BAD (before Adam died) and AAD (after Adam died). To anyone who doesn’t know me or Adam, that may sound a bit dramatic; I was only 24 when he died, which is a very early age to have your life virtually divided in half. But his death had a profound effect on me.</p>
<p><span id="more-11107"></span></p>
<p>Adam hanged himself after a short bout with early onset schizophrenia. While he had battled depression, eating disorders, and anxiety for the 10 years I had known him, his death was a complete shock to me and the rest of his friends and family. In fact, in the summer before he died, Adam had given up drinking alcohol and caffeine and took up a robust health regime.</p>
<p>For me, the biggest part of the months following Adam’s death was trying to make sense of it. In the aftermath of his death, his family and friends were left trying to piece together a reason why he would have done this.</p>
<p>At the same time, I found there was a desperate need to find someone to blame. One of the biggest problems with suicide is that your friend or loved one has been murdered, and at the same time, they have become a murderer. I was extremely angry at him while also being sad he was gone. His parents sought out explanations for how the health care team that had been treating Adam had missed his schizophrenia. We all sought a responsible party, someone to blame.</p>
<p>But in the end, Adam was responsible.</p>
<h2>The Need to Talk About It</h2>
<p>What I wanted to do most after his death was to talk about Adam. I wanted to tell his story to anyone who would listen, and even people who wouldn’t. Strangers on commuter trains to New York City would get an earful about my beloved best friend and the perils of mental illness and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/what-is-schizophrenia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">schizophrenia</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as I found out, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/attempting-to-understand-suicide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suicide</a> is an extremely taboo subject in our society. Even people who loved me deeply would shoo the subject away like an annoying fly. While distraction was helpful a lot of the time, what I needed most was to talk to someone about Adam, to memorialize him, and to try and sort out the nonsense I felt like life had suddenly become.</p>
<p>It ends up that talking about the individual, and the feelings that come from losing them, is one of the most important parts of grieving the loss of a loved one to suicide. According to Talkspace <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">therapist</a> Cynthia Catchings, LCSW-S, talking to someone who listens, understands, and cares about you is important to the healing process. She also recommends both individual therapy sessions and suicide support groups, which are particularly helpful for anyone who has lost someone to suicide.</p>
<p>“Individual sessions allow the person to talk and express their feelings and to find ways to regain their confidence, happiness, and positive outlook on life,” she says.</p>
<h2>Dark Night of the Soul</h2>
<p>My brain did funny things after Adam died; it played tricks on me. I had trouble sleeping and eating, and I lost a concerning amount of weight. I cried at the drop of a hat. I was panicked that people were going to disappear from my life without warning. I reached out to anyone who had known Adam to tell them about his life.</p>
<p>While it’s hard to admit, I also had dark nights dealing with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/common-questions-suicide-with-talkspace-therapists/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suicidal thoughts</a> myself. This is also one of the worst parts of a loved one’s suicide: it can be contagious. According to Catchings, the risk of suicide jumps in loved ones who lose someone to suicide in the months and even years after their death.</p>
<p>“A person who has lost someone to suicide is at increased risk for <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depression</a> and/or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a>,” she explains. “Studies show that thinking about, planning, or attempting suicide is a result of those risk factors.”</p>
<p>“When someone loses a loved one to suicide, it&#8217;s not rare for him/her/they to blame themselves or to wish they were dead,” she adds. “That wish does not mean that they will act on it, but it can exacerbate the depression, resulting in not eating or sleeping, which can be detrimental to their health.”</p>
<p>She recommends that anyone who has lost someone to suicide take steps to take care of themselves by <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/sleep-deprivation-hurts-mental-health/">getting enough sleep</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/how-to-eat-your-way-to-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eating healthy foods</a>, and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/mental-health-workout-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exercising</a>. “That will improve your mood and health in general,” Catchings says.</p>
<p>I was lucky to be in a supportive community where I could find help. My boyfriend at the time was very supportive, and dealt with my crying jags and insomnia with care and sympathy. I started seeing a psychiatrist who also worked in talk therapy, and I was prescribed several medications to help me through the most difficult darkness.</p>
<h2>A Community of Loss</h2>
<p>I also found that I was by no means alone in having lost someone. The people who were most helpful during my initial <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/finding-help-complicated-grief/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grief</a> were those who had been through it themselves. There were many people in my life who were available to listen and share their own stories. This was my own suicide support group, and it helped me immensely during the hardest parts of losing Adam.</p>
<p>“Suicide support groups allow the person to learn from others, to share, and to realize they are not alone,” Catchings says.</p>
<p>My life AAD has given me a support group and access to a greater community of those who’ve experienced similar loss. In fact, I believe that I am now a much more compassionate person than I might have been otherwise.</p>
<p>Having gone through the ordeal myself, I know how to help friends through loss, especially <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/experience-survivors-suicide-therapist-person/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">losing someone to suicide</a>. I know how to prompt them to tell me how they feel and how to offer them a safe space to talk. I know how to encourage them to find a good therapist that they connect with, even if it’s hard and even if insurance makes it difficult. I know to listen without judgment when they talk about their darkest feelings.</p>
<p>I also know that time is the greatest healer. The best advice I have ever received when the feelings were overwhelming was: <i>Wait</i>.</p>
<p>“Accept your emotions, since the feelings are normal but will not be permanent,” Cynthia Catchings adds.</p>
<p>I think of the emotions of loss as waves on a beach. Sometimes they’ll be heavier and raging from a storm; sometimes they’ll be calm and smooth; sometimes they’ll be far off from a low tide. All you have to do is wait for them to change.</p>
<p>While my life may never be the same again, I learned lessons from Adam’s death that I would not trade. If I have to miss him, I may as well have learned something from his absence.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anxiety and depression are intricately linked, which is why the same types of therapy and the same classes of medications are often used to treat both disorders.</p>
<p>In my practice, I have noticed that many clients that have self-diagnosed as depressed are actually experiencing anxiety. Similarly, many clients who identify as anxious are often depressed. Here, I will explain the connections between anxiety and depression, and why one can lead to the other.</p>
<p><span id="more-11057"></span></p>
<h2>Shared Traits and Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression</h2>
<h3>Nervous Energy</h3>
<p>When you are anxious, your predominant feeling is that of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/trained-worry-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worry</a>, and being wound too tightly. You feel like you can’t relax, and that danger is everywhere in some form or another. However, the irritability associated with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/">depression</a> gives you a similar wound up feeling. Often, the overlap between the two can be difficult to tease apart.</p>
<h3>Avoidance or Retreat</h3>
<p>Anxiety makes people retreat from situations, out of fear that they will be evaluated poorly, or that some danger will befall them. Depression also leads to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/identifying-avoidant-partner-improve-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retreat from the world</a>, since you feel so negatively about yourself and others that you can’t imagine a reason to purposefully put yourself into contact with other people.</p>
<h3>Negative Thinking</h3>
<p>When you are depressed, you see the worst in every situation. The depressive cognitive triad includes <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/negative-thinking-got-you-down-heres-how-to-shift-your-thoughts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative thoughts</a> about yourself, the world, and the future. For example, going to a party, you may think, “nobody will like me, I’m not going to make any friends.” There may in fact be a strong likelihood of this outcome coming to pass, since when you’re depressed, you don’t act as outgoing, engaged, or responsive.</p>
<p>However, if you focus on these negative thoughts about others, you may end up diagnosing yourself as <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/01/what-causes-social-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">socially anxious</a>, and not recognizing the major impact that your depression has on your thinking.</p>
<h3>Behavioral Changes</h3>
<p>Additionally, both <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/">anxiety</a> and depression can result in changes in your behavior.</p>
<p>Anxiety and depression can both prompt people to withdraw from social situations, for different reasons. However, let’s say you withdraw from parties due to fatigue and apathy. Eventually when you’re out of practice at socializing, you will in fact have raised your chances for developing social anxiety, as any anxiety deepens with avoidance of the feared situation.</p>
<p>It’s much the same when you stop engaging in world-expanding behaviors, like driving, flying, or even leaving the house, due to anxiety. Over time, your world will shrink and you may become depressed thinking about all of your missed opportunities.</p>
<h2>No Matter the Challenge, Therapy Can Help</h2>
<p>Whether you’re anxious, depressed, or (sometimes) both, therapy can help you get yourself back on track. A good therapist can help you identify what you’re feeling, and work to treat the exact issues you are struggling with.</p>
<p>There is no shame in getting help and support from a trained professional. Once you and your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">therapist</a> figure out how your anxiety or depression, or both, is manifesting in your life, you can both figure out next steps to take to create a life that makes you feel happy and fulfilled.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people struggle with the fear of success, fear of closeness, or fear of happiness. Let’s say your father suffered from depression and ranted about the workplace being a dog-eat-dog environment where everyone has to watch his back.</p>
<p>As a child, you, like all kids, want to think of your father as intelligent and perceptive. You listened to him and thought that his worldview made sense. Even if you later realized, as an adult, that your father was a very negative and depressed person, his impact on your own worldview may be very difficult to change.</p>
<p>Although it isn’t rational, many people subconsciously steer themselves away from experiences where they feel good about themselves, or where they end up feeling happy. But why is this and what can you do about it?</p>
<p><span id="more-10889"></span></p>
<h2>The Root of Fears of Success and Happiness</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/negative-thinking-got-you-down-heres-how-to-shift-your-thoughts/" target="_blank">negative</a> or depressive worldview is often at the root of the fear of feeling good. There is a psychological phenomenon called <strong>confirmation bias</strong>, which means that people subconsciously seek out experiences that confirm the way that they already think of themselves and the world.</p>
<p>If you grow up in <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/when-does-family-drama-become-toxic/" target="_blank">a home where everyone felt and acted very negative</a>, then it is probable that you currently view the world and yourself through a negative lens. This means that you are likely drawn to experiences that end up making you feel bad about yourself, or that confirm your preconception that the world is a bad place.</p>
<h2>How a Negative Worldview Affects You in the Workplace</h2>
<p>When you go to work, you may subconsciously be looking around for evidence that others are out to get you or want to harm you in some way.</p>
<p>You may steer clear of evidence that would run counter to this worldview, which would mean that you don’t try that hard to socialize with people in the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/millennials-guide-mental-illness-workplace/" target="_blank">workplace</a>, and instead keep your guard up. You may turn down invitations to happy hour, and instead stick to your familiar mantra that you can’t trust anyone and you wouldn’t have enjoyed hanging out with those people anyway.</p>
<h2>Fear of Happiness in Relationships</h2>
<p>In another common example, people who don’t think highly of themselves end up with partner or even <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/types-friends-bad-mental-health/" target="_blank">friends who treat them poorly</a>. If you think that you aren’t deserving of respect or love, then you subconsciously are attracted to people who act disrespectfully and unkindly.</p>
<p>When people with low self-esteem meet potential partners who treat them well, they often say they aren’t attracted to these people for some reason or other. In actuality, the reason for the lack of attraction may be the fear of finally feeling happy, finally letting your guard down…only to be blindsided by rejection or failure.</p>
<h2>Unhappiness as a Vicious Cycle&#8230;</h2>
<p>If you are used to feeling bad about yourself, then it is more comfortable and easier to continue putting yourself in unfulfilling situations. Taking the risk of aiming higher may feel too intimidating, as it could lead to potential disappointment.</p>
<p>This is why so many people <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/4-signs-youre-self-sabotaging-how-to-stop/" target="_blank">self-sabotage</a> their chances for romantic, career, or social success. It is more familiar to lurk on the outskirts of life than to take a running jump into the middle of it, and potentially fail dramatically.</p>
<h2>… and How to Break this Cycle</h2>
<p>If you struggle with the fear of success, or the fear of happiness, a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/10/heres-makes-good-therapist-17-signs-look/" target="_blank">good therapist</a> can often help you understand why you keep getting in your own way. Often, when you work on your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/self-esteem/" target="_blank">self-esteem</a> and are better able to respect and love yourself, opportunities for happiness and success will seem to almost magically arise.</p>
<p>In fact, this isn’t magic, but just the same opportunities that arise for everyone, that have been there all along, but that you were refusing to allow yourself to see and act on.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have noticed that your intimate relationships have been stressful or unfulfilling, it might be time to think about your attachment style. Attachment style derives from your earliest experiences with your parents.</p>
<p>Knowing the effects these parenting styles have on you as a child helps you better understand the roots of potential relationship issues, and where to begin when addressing these issues — whether on your own, or with the help of a therapist.</p>
<p><span id="more-10817"></span></p>
<h2>The Two Types of Attachment</h2>
<p>There are two main types of attachment: <b>secure</b> and <b>insecure</b>.</p>
<h2>Secure attachment explained</h2>
<p>A securely attached baby knows that their <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/raised-by-anxious-parents-heres-how-it-might-be-affecting-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">parents</a> are involved and caring. There is a healthy balance between comfort, affection, independence, and exploration. For instance, a securely attached baby will play with an interesting toy, but then crawl back to her mother for comfort when she is tired.</p>
<p>Secure attachment is created by a parent who is confident in expressing love, and also confident about allowing their child to explore their environment. A securely attached child learns that the world is a safe and friendly place, and that loved ones can be trusted to give you space, but also to provide you with nurturance and closeness.</p>
<p>As an adult in an <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/guide-setting-healthy-boundaries-relationships/" target="_blank">intimate relationship</a>, a securely attached person will be trusting and open, able to give their partner space while being confident that their partner will return to them. They will not be excessively jealous or distant, which are both hallmarks of insecurity.</p>
<h2>Insecure attachment explained</h2>
<p>Within insecure attachment, there are two subtypes: <b>preoccupied</b> and <b>avoidant</b>.</p>
<h3>Preoccupied insecure attachment</h3>
<p>People with preoccupied attachment had parents who could not be counted upon to give love and comfort when needed. They showed love, but only when it was convenient for them. At other times, they could act cold, distant, or even abusive. Parents with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/really-means-psychopath-sociopath-narcissist/" target="_blank">narcissism</a> or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/borderline-personality-disorder/" target="_blank">borderline personality disorder</a> often foster preoccupied attachment in their children. Kids with preoccupied attachment learn to be hypervigilant around their parents, trying to be present in case a loving moment happens, while keeping their guard up in case they end up getting hurt.</p>
<p>In adulthood, preoccupied individuals act jealous and clingy with their significant others. They struggle with trust and can act smothering and intrusive within intimate relationships. They are trying to make up for their childhood, where their parent’s love was unpredictable. Now, in adulthood, they want to control their partner and ensure that they are always present. As you can imagine, this often ends up pushing partners away, which makes the preoccupied partner even more <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxious</a>.</p>
<h3>Avoidant insecure attachment</h3>
<p>On the other end of the insecure attachment spectrum is avoidant attachment. Children with avoidant attachment learn that their parents cannot be relied upon for emotional sustenance at all. These parents are consistently cold, distant, or even <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/turn-childhood-hardship-success-2/">neglectful or abusive</a>. These kids learn that it is unsafe to rely upon others for emotional closeness, and they become extremely independent at an early age.</p>
<p>As adults, those with avoidant attachment have great difficulty with expressing need or vulnerability. They find it almost impossible to rely on anyone, or to ask for their needs to be met. This can be very frustrating for their romantic partners, who yearn for a closer connection than the avoidant partner may feel comfortable providing. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/identifying-avoidant-partner-improve-relationship/" target="_blank">Avoidant partners</a> often cheat, or date many people simultaneously. Anything to avoid feeling dependent on one person, who they subconsciously fear will disappoint them as their parents did.</p>
<h2>Mental Health Challenges Can Create Parental Distance</h2>
<p>Parents of both types of insecurely attached people are not bad or ill-intentioned. They did not try to be distant or unpredictable. They love their children and may have been struggling with issues such as personality disorders, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a>, anxiety, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/addiction/" target="_blank">addiction</a>, or trauma histories of their own.</p>
<p>They may have been overwhelmed by the demands of parenting, or in marriages that did not provide them with the emotional support that they needed. No matter the reason, it still stands that they were unable to give their children the secure love that they needed, and this has an impact long past childhood.</p>
<h2>What to do if You’re Insecure in Your Attachment Style</h2>
<p>If you recognize yourself or your partner in the above insecure attachment descriptions, you may want to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/know-youre-ready-therapy/" target="_blank">consider therapy</a>. If you recognize one, you likely recognize both, as avoidant and preoccupied individuals are typically drawn to one another and exacerbate each other’s attachment issues.. Additionally, reading up on attachment, such as the book <i>Attached</i> by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller, can provide you with important insight into yourself and your relationships.</p>
<p>It can be very illuminating to discuss your upbringing with a therapist, and to finally understand the root of whatever unfulfilling relationship patterns you exhibit.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You go forth into the world to follow your dreams and shine your beautiful light — only to feel like a fraud on the inside. You begin working on something, and self-doubt and anxiety creep into your brain. So, you choose over preparation and exert overreaching effort. You may even accomplish your goal through luck. But truly, you just want relief, and it comes only temporarily, until you push back any form of positive feedback — resulting in a loop back to anxiety and feeling like a fraud.</p>
<p>This is the cycle of imposter syndrome.</p>
<p><span id="more-10805"></span></p>
<p>The invasion of imposter syndrome can affect the progression of your career and personal life. Some people are more vulnerable than others, such as those with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxiety</a> or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a>; severe cases of imposter syndrome and its depressive effects may even lead to suicidal behaviors or self-harm. You may also harm yourself emotionally or spiritually through <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/4-signs-youre-self-sabotaging-how-to-stop/" target="_blank">self-sabotage</a>. You may feel paranoid, emotionally distressed, isolated, and invisible.</p>
<h2>Imposter Syndrome Places Limits on Your Life</h2>
<p>Experiencing imposter syndrome means, on a daily basis, you face the distortion of thought that you may be lazy, unintelligent, or incompetent. You fear you’ve taken “fake it until you make it” too literally and wonder when you’ll actually succeed. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/12/this-simple-attitude-change-will-dramatically-improve-your-quality-of-life/" target="_blank">Self-doubt</a> and negative self-talk affect your day-to-day life as you undercut your value.</p>
<p>In severe cases, when the effects of imposter syndrome snowball, your performance at work may fall so low that your worst fears come true — your hesitance, avoidance or constant apology result in self-sabotage.</p>
<p>It may be that you’re afraid of judgment from an authority figure. Physical reactions to stress include shaking, startled reactions, dry mouth, and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/the-surprising-new-connection-between-sleep-and-mental-health/" target="_blank">insomnia</a> — look for these signs as you note triggers.</p>
<p>You may also overcompensate in self-harming ways by setting poor boundaries, taking on more work than you should, staying late. This creates tension in your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/working-hard-burning-out/" target="_blank">work-life balance</a>, adding to your stress.</p>
<p>Imposter syndrome places limits on your potential and ability to live your life enjoyably, with satisfaction and to the fullest.</p>
<h2>What Research Says About Imposter Syndrome</h2>
<p>In the 1970s, Suzanne Imes and Pauline Clance discovered the phenomenon when <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1979-26502-001" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">their research</a> found many high-achieving women felt like frauds. The syndrome, however, affects both women and men.</p>
<p>Follow-up studies report <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_ladder/2016/04/is_impostor_syndrome_real_and_does_it_affect_women_more_than_men.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">no differences in imposter feelings</a> among women and men. Imposter syndrome affects multiple demographics and backgrounds — workers in various industries say they feel like frauds. Unfortunately, people still talk about it as a women’s issue because women are more likely to speak up about their experiences of feeling like imposters.</p>
<p>People like to say millennials are narcissists, but <a href="https://thehustle.co/why-70-percent-of-millennials-have-impostor-syndrome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">70 percent of them feel like imposters</a>. Also, people who feel the need to continually challenge themselves may be more at risk for imposter syndrome.</p>
<h2>Effectively Overcoming Imposter Syndrome</h2>
<p>You can find relief for imposter syndrome through mentoring, self-help, or counseling like that provided by <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)</a>.</p>
<p>Opening up to those you trust in your social and professional circles may also help. Has a friend previously expressed feeling like a fraud to you? Do you have a mentor you can turn to with your feelings of doubt? Your life and job have unique demands, and you need someone you can relate to who will help ground you.</p>
<p>Start by challenging your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/negative-thinking-got-you-down-heres-how-to-shift-your-thoughts/" target="_blank">negative self-talk</a> and worst-case scenarios. Accept them and develop a plan of action to strategize proactive steps to head off this negativity. Track your successes and compliments. Return to these when you feel less than confident about your abilities.</p>
<p>Imposter syndrome is a psychological phenomenon keeps you from internalizing your accomplishments. When others provide proof of your success or competence, or give you praise, you dismiss it as timing or luck. You may not feel deserving of praise, but the truth is that everyone feels like a fraud at some point.</p>
<p>Once you recognize these feelings, you can take steps to make things better and feel like the success you truly are.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When your thoughts start spiraling, getting off the “staircase” can feel impossible. One terrible notion leads to the next: <i>If I can&#8217;t get this report done in time</i>, you might think, <i>then I&#8217;ll be fired. And if I&#8217;m fired, I&#8217;ll have nothing to do all day. If I have nothing to do all day, I&#8217;ll fall into a video game and beer hole. If I fall into a video game and beer hole, then my wife will leave me. </i>And then…and then…and <i>then</i>…</p>
<p>Does this process sound familiar? This anxiety spiral — also known as &#8220;catastrophic thinking&#8221; or &#8220;magnifying,&#8221; — often occurs alongside anxiety and depression. Think of your brain as a rocky mountain: one single distressing thought loosens an avalanche of related anxieties.</p>
<p><span id="more-10799"></span></p>
<p>Here are some other examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I don&#8217;t stay up all night studying, I&#8217;ll fail my test — and if I fail my test, I&#8217;ll be kicked out of school.</li>
<li>I have a missed call from my mother — someone I love must have died.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s a weird freckle on my elbow. It&#8217;s cancer. I&#8217;m going to die. Tomorrow.</li>
</ul>
<p>No matter how true and valid each thought <i>feels</i>, it&#8217;s important to remember that they are simply thoughts — and thoughts can be constrained. Minimizing your catastrophic thoughts can help reduce your anxiety or be an important stepping-stone in your depression recovery: after all, these torrential cascades of terrible thoughts <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/04/how-stress-affects-our-bodies/" target="_blank">increase cortisol levels in your brain</a>. Too much cortisol — also known as the &#8220;stress hormone&#8221; — can cause <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress/art-20046037" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a number of long-term health problems</a>.</p>
<h2>How to Prevent Catastrophic Thinking</h2>
<p>Prevent catastrophic thinking by preparing your mind <i>before</i> a distressing thought strikes. Here&#8217;s how.</p>
<h3>1. Keep an eye on your thoughts</h3>
<p>How can you stop something you don&#8217;t realize is happening until you&#8217;re deep in its maw? The first step in preventing the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxiety</a> avalanche is learning to recognize the unique fingerprint of your brain&#8217;s catastrophic thinking.</p>
<p>Practice observing your thoughts without judging their validity or truthfulness. If that sounds hard, you aren&#8217;t alone: there&#8217;s a reason an <a href="http://time.com/4624276/yoga-workplace-mindfulness/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">increasing number of Americans</a> are taking up yoga and meditation. Sign up for a nearby yoga class or take time each morning to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/meditation-science-eases-anxiety/" target="_blank">meditate</a>. These practices teach you how to acknowledge your thoughts — without getting swept up in their tide.</p>
<p>Stopping catastrophic thinking requires stepping in at the first sign of trouble. Once you understand your personal thought patterns, recognizing a disturbance will be much easier.</p>
<h3>2. Find your spiral&#8217;s source</h3>
<p>When you&#8217;re deep in the black cloud of panicked thinking, uncovering the spiral&#8217;s original spark can be difficult. You&#8217;re worried about <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/02/dating-someone-with-anxiety-what-you-need-to-know-and-do/" target="_blank">losing your boyfriend</a>, your apartment, <i>and</i> your job — but dig deep to find the root. Did this spiral begin because you failed a pop quiz in chemistry class? Because you felt a funny lump in your armpit?</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve found what caused the spiral, it&#8217;s easier to deal with the problem. Think about it like killing a fast-growing vine: If you don&#8217;t dig out the roots, the leaves will continue spreading indefinitely.</p>
<h3>3. Use your logical brain</h3>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve dialed down your catastrophic thinking to its source, take time to dissect your specific anxieties about the issue. Now is a great opportunity to practice your meditation skills, lest you fall into yet another spiral during the dissection! Perhaps learning how to drive terrifies you, and your thinking catastrophizes every time you get behind the wheel.</p>
<p>Use logic to help defeat your wily brain. A lot of panic comes down to <a href="https://drpatrickkeelan.com/anxiety/managing-anxiety-by-reducing-catastrophic-thinking-part-1-overestimating-danger/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">overestimating the <i>true</i> chances of danger</a>. Learning the facts may sooth your mind: Research how often car accidents happen and read up on best driving practices to ensure that you&#8217;re the safest driver you can be.</p>
<p>Are your concerns health-related? While it might seem scary, the best cure is seeing your doctor. Or if you&#8217;re struggling at work, talk it through with your boss — chances are they&#8217;ll be more kind and receptive than you expected.</p>
<h3>4. Challenge your anxious thinking</h3>
<p>Spirals are scary because the thoughts feel so real, but if you notice yourself slipping, take a deep breath and challenge your beliefs. Ask yourself, &#8220;Is this threat real <i>right now</i>?&#8221; Perhaps you&#8217;ve been stuck in your bed for days waiting for laboratory test results. Your mind may be caught up in a web of worries: Do I have a disease? If I have a disease, am I going to die? Even if I survive, how will I afford my care?</p>
<p>Stop. Focus on the here and the now. If the test results are bad, you can deal with it at that moment — don&#8217;t waste time panicking about it now!</p>
<p>You want to challenge your catastrophic thinking, but you don&#8217;t want to beat yourself up for having anxious thoughts. Our brain does all sorts of unwelcome things without our consent, and having a panic spiral doesn&#8217;t make you a bad person. Don&#8217;t get angry at yourself for falling for your mind&#8217;s clever trap — focus your energies on escaping its pull.</p>
<h2>Get in touch with a professional.</h2>
<p>Not everyone can overcome their catastrophic thinking solo, and that&#8217;s okay! If you&#8217;re struggling to rein in your thoughts, <a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/online-therapy-with-a-licensed-therapist?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_POST_INLINE&amp;utr_adgroup=what-is-catastrophic-thinking-and-how-to-stop&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/09/catastrophic-thinking-thought-spirals-how-to-stop/">reach out to a therapist</a> for additional help.</p>
<p>They can work through the causes of your catastrophic thinking and recommend specific, tailored-to-you exercises and techniques. With their help, you can step out of the spiral and start living again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of us were getting together for the first time since graduation, reminiscing about our earlier selves.</p>
<p>“We were all horrible in college,” my friend said recently over drinks. “We were so status-obsessed and trying to keep up with everyone <i>else </i>who was status-obsessed.”</p>
<p>Another friend, sipping his beer, put it more succinctly: “We were all so depressed in college.”</p>
<p>He meant this literally.</p>
<p><span id="more-10674"></span></p>
<h2>Why Anxiety and Depression in College is Prevalent</h2>
<p>It’s not just us. According to recent research, depression and anxiety affect <a href="https://theconversation.com/1-in-5-college-students-have-anxiety-or-depression-heres-why-90440" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">one in five</a> college students. Mental health issues aren’t limited to young people pursuing higher education. In fact, <a href="https://www.self.com/story/depression-rates-teens-young-adults" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">depression is on the rise</a> among young adults in general, with depression among teenagers ages 12-20 increasing from 8.7% in 2005 to 11.3% in 2014. Among young adults ages 18-25, depression increased from 8.8% in 2005 and 9.6% in 2014. This has been tied to various factors, like the increase in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42705881" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">social media use</a> among teens.</p>
<h3>Student Debt is a Major Trigger</h3>
<p>But there’s another major driver of college students’ anxieties: student debt. Researchers have found that the <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/10/25/tuition-and-fees-still-rising-faster-aid-college-board-report-shows" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ever-increasing rise in tuition</a> harms students’ mental health. Student debt can <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahlandrum/2017/10/20/the-impact-of-student-loan-debt-on-millennial-happiness/#7170d8307125" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">dampen a student’s excitement</a> about graduating from college and haunt their post-college plans. With 70% of college students graduating with debt, and the average undergraduate student debt a staggering $33,000, these anxieties are widespread.</p>
<p>That’s bad news for college students’ mental health. One study found that students with more than $25,000 in debt <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/belkin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reported significantly decreased well-being</a> than their counterparts with less debt, and this effect persisted even decades after graduation. The rising cost of tuition has gone hand-in-hand with stunning increases in college student <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/03/599197919/hunger-and-homelessness-are-widespread-among-college-students-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">homelessness,</a> hunger, and economic insecurity, which in turn have a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5775138/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">negative impact on mental health.</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">stagnating wages</a> and the mainstreaming of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/04/22/the-unhappy-rise-of-the-millennial-intern/#1bfea8671328" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">unpaid internship</a> can add an extra burden to students worrying about how they’re going to achieve professional success and put food on the table (if they can afford tables).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/online-therapy-with-a-licensed-therapist?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_MID&amp;utr_adgroup=midpost-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=10674&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/09/lower-high-expectations-in-college/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4880 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png" alt="affordable blog purchase CTA" width="660" height="240" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png 660w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a></p>
<h2>The Mental Cost of Pressures to Succeed</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.jad-journal.com/article/S0165-0327(14)00686-7/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">top three reasons</a> among college students seeking counseling are academic performance, pressure to succeed, and post-graduation plans.</p>
<p>Of course, we all want to work hard, plan for the future, and do our best to succeed. For students with massive debt to repay, failure to obtain a well-paying job after graduation can translate to financial catastrophe. These are big, society-wide problems, and we can’t solve them by addressing our individual mental health.</p>
<p>But we <i>can </i>adopt strategies to keep ourselves healthy in these demanding and precarious environments. That starts with saying bye-bye to unrealistic expectations and practicing <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/5-ways-improve-body-image-confidence-mental-health/" target="_blank">self compassion</a>.</p>
<p>Many of my peers in college used some variation of the phrase: “Work, sleep, or social life: pick two.” Most of us picked work and social life, sleep be damned — including me. In retrospect, I think we all would have been a whole lot healthier, kinder, and — dare I say it? — more productive if we cut down a little on the work part and added a bit more to the sleep part. Hey, <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/sleep-and-mental-health" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">it’s science</a>.</p>
<h2>Begin College by Setting Important Priorities</h2>
<p>As we’re entering higher education, we can ask ourselves: what do I absolutely need to do, what would I like to do, and what can I skip? Getting good grades and learning skills in our chosen field are likely non-negotiable, as is taking some kind of paid work for many students.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/5-ways-exercise-is-great-for-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">exercise</a>, nurturing our relationships with supportive friends, and, yes, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/the-surprising-new-connection-between-sleep-and-mental-health/" target="_blank">sleep</a> should be in the non-negotiable pile, too. If you’re lucky enough to study in a college that provides resources like a free gym, free exercise classes, healthy dining hall options, or subsidized therapy, why not take advantage?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, taking a second internship or a third volunteer opportunity because all your friends are doing it may seem like a good idea, until you’re growling at your boyfriend over tiny stuff, wearing dirty underwear, and falling asleep in class. Saying no to opportunities is hard, but it’s also an important skill for being a real, live adult.</p>
<p>Many of us don’t have the luxury of cutting down on activities like paid work or demanding professional training. But in the areas that you can, lowering your unreasonably high expectations to “reasonably high expectations” for the sake of self-care is a gift to yourself.</p>
<p>It’s also a gift to everyone else in your life, who will get to interact with a caring and fulfilled loved one rather than a stressed-out zombie. I know it’s obnoxious when any older person says this to a college student, but: trust me, you will thank yourself later. Okay, you can roll your eyes now.</p>
<h2>The Benefits of Hard Work and Gratitude</h2>
<p>As for me? I’m grateful for the privileges I received in college, and hope that the experience I accrued in my overachieving, obnoxious zombie years helps me pay off those Millennial student loans.</p>
<p>But as I sat with my friends recently at that bar, I noticed that our faces and laughter are unmistakably happier now than they were back then. Yes, we may be underpaid graduate students and gig economy workers burdened with unreasonable debt. But by god, we get our eight hours of sleep each night.</p>
