				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the internet, there are endless lists of the things you can do to heal yourself of any ailment: from <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depression</a> to migraines, from <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a> to irritable bowel syndrome. Apparently you can cure anything simply chant positive mantras, drink enough water to become a camel, and practice yoga 24/7&#8230;maybe even shower while standing on one&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>The internet would like us to believe that this is particularly true when it comes to mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression. If I had a dime for every time I’ve heard &#8220;just do X to snap out of Y,&#8221; I&#8217;d be retired, sipping umbrella drinks in Tahiti.<span id="more-11434"></span></p>
<p>That said, there has been more than anecdotal evidence that something as simple as regular <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/5-ways-exercise-is-great-for-your-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exercise</a> cure anxiety and depression. Some experts maintain that exercise holds the potential to ease the symptoms of many illnesses, including those of the mental variety. Let’s explore whether exercise really can make a difference with anxiety and depression, or similar mental illness diagnoses that affect <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">one in five Americans</a>.</p>
<h2>Endorphins Are Our Friends</h2>
<p>Everyone knows about the endorphin rush you feel after a good workout. Doesn&#8217;t that rush wear off, though?</p>
<p><a href="https://media.utoronto.ca/media-releases/moderate-exercise-not-only-treats-but-prevents-depression/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">According to a University of Toronto study</a>, individuals who are active for 20-30 minutes each day can ward off depression in the long-term. Choose a workout that you love, such as dance, running or weightlifting, and make it a regular part of your routine to not only treat, but according to the study, prevent depression.</p>
<h2>Rerouting Nervous Energy</h2>
<p>While exercise is by no means a substitute for <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/am-i-going-to-be-on-meds-forever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">medication</a> and psychiatric care, it can diffuse excess anxious energy. Working out regulates adrenaline, the chemical that gives us our fight-or-flight response to danger. It’s been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3632802/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">shown by many studies and meta-analyses</a> that exercise is associated with reduced anxiety in clinical settings.</p>
<p>For this reason, exercise can sometimes assist those with anxiety disorders to minimize their <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/anxiety-attack-vs-panic-attack-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panic</a>. The next time you’re feeling anxious try taking a brisk walk if possible.</p>
<h2>The Michael Phelps&#8217; Experience</h2>
<p>Olympic gold medal winner Michael Phelps <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/michael" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">discusses the connections between exercise and depression</a> when he opened up about his own mental health struggles. Obviously, just knowing that one of the most elite athletes in the world actively works through mental health challenges should show that working out is not a cure-all for mental illness.</p>
<p>However, by utilizing exercise in combination with medication and/or talk therapy with a licensed mental health professional, you can make great strides toward better mental health outcomes.</p>
<h2>Be Honest about Expectations</h2>
<p>When he couldn&#8217;t complete a workout for any reason (e.g., busy schedule, time in transit), Michael Phelps noticed the negative impact on his mental health. It became as simple as making the time, no matter where he was, rather than being harsh with himself or making up excuses not to.</p>
<p>Depression often causes overwhelming feelings of lethargy that simply can&#8217;t be pushed through. So be gentle with yourself during these times! What you don&#8217;t want to do is feel guilty <a href="https://www.self.com/story/depression-anxiety-exercise“ target=”_blank" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">over missing a workout</a> when you&#8217;re already feeling low.</p>
<p>Keep your exercise expectations reasonable. You wouldn&#8217;t give yourself a guilt trip for missing a workout when you had the flu, so if your symptoms are just too much, be kind as you excuse yourself. Remember though, that exercise often lifts us out of these tough places.</p>
<h2>Remember, Palliative Care Is Still Care</h2>
<p>If you suffer from <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/what-is-crippling-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chronic depression</a> or anxiety, you no doubt know you may be in for a lifelong battle. However, it’s important not to let your challenges throw you into a deeper despair.</p>
<p>Even if combining exercise with your regular treatment doesn&#8217;t bring a cure, it can lift your spirits for a time and provide some extra motivation. Even if exercise is not be a cure, if it can make you feel better, it&#8217;s worth doing. It is also important for your overall health, which should be plenty motivating.</p>
<p>Living with anxiety or depression, or both, isn&#8217;t easy. If you suffer from mental illness, you already know how hard it can be. While it&#8217;s not a cure, exercise can be another weapon in the battle against depression and anxiety.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re anything like me, you have a routine set in place from the moment you wake up.</p>
<p><i>Open eyes. </i></p>
<p><i>Check the dog&#8230;yep, still breathing. </i></p>
<p><i>Roll over and check on my boyfriend — yup, he’s still breathing, too. </i></p>
<p><i>From there, I immediately grab my phone and open each social media app to see what breaking news I’ve missed over the last, oh, six hours, and then begin my day. </i></p>
<p>Some of my routines, the morning workout, might be beneficial, but the more I work on my mental health, the more I realize that some of my <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/ways-youre-making-life-harder-than-needs-be/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">daily habits</a> could potentially be harming my well-being. Charles Duhigg, author of <i>The Power of Habit </i>and former business writer for the New York<i> Times</i>, writes that “Routines are the organizational analogue of habits,” and that starting new habits can be as difficult as breaking bad ones — but that harnessing the power of routine can have powerful effects on both productivity and our mental state.</p>
<p><span id="more-10569"></span></p>
<p>Below, we’ll discuss a few of the most common habits, how they might be harming your mental health, and how to improve them.</p>
<h2>Scrolling our Instagram Feed</h2>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it crazy how scrolling across your Instagram feed is an autopilot response when you first wake up, when you’re commuting on public transit, killing a few moments during lunch, or just sitting at your desk? I catch myself doing this regularly during any lull in my day. While this may seem like a typical habit, it could be a <a href="http://time.com/4793331/instagrawm-social-media-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">contributing factor to your depression and brain fog</a>. When you scroll through your insta-feed as often as I do, it can cause you to compare your life to the lives of others, your body to the next Insta-fit model, or your mellow Friday night to someone else&#8217;s night out on the town.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/managing-social-media-intake-without-quitting/" target="_blank">Social media</a> depression is more common that many realize. It&#8217;s easy to feel down about your life when you are scrolling through everyone else&#8217;s highlight reel.</p>
<h2>Complaining to Everyone (and Yourself)</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s healthy to express yourself, even if you’re feeling frustrated or upset, but negative thought patterns can be destructive. The reason: negative thoughts breed more negative thoughts, which leads to a negative attitude and cynical outlook on life.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to be mindful of how often we&#8217;re complaining to others as well. While some commiseration is healthy, too much can lead to negative ruminations. Complaining can be a difficult habit to break, especially if your friends or co-workers thrive on lamenting to one another during a coffee break. It&#8217;s important to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/women-s-mental-health-matters/201509/7-ways-deal-negative-thoughts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">stop these negative thoughts </a>as they happen to break the cycle. Practice gratitude, by thinking of the things that you’re thankful for (sounds cliche, I know), or jotting down positive mantras in your planner or journal.</p>
<p><a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/online-therapy-with-a-licensed-therapist?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_MID&amp;utr_adgroup=midpost-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=10569&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/5-daily-habits-that-are-actually-hurting-your-mental-health/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4880 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png" alt="affordable blog purchase CTA" width="660" height="240" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png 660w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a></p>
<h2>Weighing Yourself Every Morning</h2>
<p>Staying active and maintaining a healthy weight is an excellent goal, but there is a fine line between monitoring your weight and becoming obsessed with the numbers on the scale. Weighing yourself daily often leads to<a href="http://time.com/4106738/weight-scale-body-issues/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> obsessive thoughts</a> about weight fluctuation. What seems like a normal part of your morning can, if engaged routinely without care, lead to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/how-to-stop-obsessive-thinking/" target="_blank">obsessive thoughts</a> about your body image and weight fluctuations.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve struggled with this since I was a teenager, and have had to break the cycle with the help of my therapist and an accountability partner. Our weight can change daily based on food intake, water weight, hormone shifts, and even the time of day, so cut yourself some slack and ease off the scale!</p>
<h2>Using Your Phone Before Bed</h2>
<p>If your cell phone is the first thing in your hand when you wake up and the last thing in your hand before your head hits the pillow, you may find yourself battling restlessness and insomnia. This is because our phones<a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> stimulate our brains</a>, keeping the mind active and alert for up to two hours from the last time you last used your cell phone.</p>
<p>Combat restlessness and overstimulation by stopping the use of your phone at least an hour before you fall asleep. Replace that time spent scrolling by reading a book (not on a tablet), coloring in an adult coloring book, meditating, or journaling.</p>
<h2>Drinking Caffeine Before Your Commute</h2>
<p>Does your high-traffic commute down the central expressway or public transportation trigger <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/commute-tips-to-let-go" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">nervousness and anxiety</a>? Your morning cup of joe may be the culprit. While caffeine increases alertness and focus, it can also stimulate <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/how-to-get-rid-of-anxiety-separating-good-bad/" target="_blank">anxiety symptoms</a> such as heart palpitations, elevated temperature (ever feel like you&#8217;re getting a hot flash on the train?), uneasiness, and shortness of breath.</p>
<p>Commuter&#8217;s tip: hold off on the double espresso until you&#8217;re at your office and have navigated the morning rat race. Replace your usual commuters beverage with something calming, like an herbal tea or bottle of lemon water instead.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to break these small, yet impactful daily habits that may be impacting your mental health. The best way to recalibrate your daily routine is to maintain a state of mindfulness so that you can easily correct whatever habit you’re trying to break. By committing to a healthier routine — with fewer interruptions, distractions, and a little less <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/why-reach-for-phone-constantly/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">stimulation</a> — you’ll be giving yourself a more balanced, less chaotic lifestyle.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone has their own way of embracing self-care and addressing their mental health. It&#8217;s important for your mental well-being and can provide a valuable reset that leaves you more positive and productive going forward. Today, we’re sharing some secret tips from a therapist on the best way you can spend your mental health day.</p>
<p><span id="more-10559"></span></p>
<h2>Get a Good Night’s Rest</h2>
<p>The first key to taking care your mental health, which is often overlooked, is to get a good night’s rest! So the night before your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/stigma-asking-mental-health-day/" target="_blank">mental health day</a>, make sure to give yourself a block of at least 8 hours of sleep. If you’re not a particularly good sleeper, you may want to block off as much as 9-10 hours for sleep as interruptions during the night might leave you feeling tired throughout the day. And don’t forget to set your alarm clock just out of arm’s reach so that you can’t just roll over and hit that snooze button.</p>
<h2>Set Goals for the Day</h2>
<p>When you wake in the morning, start your day with a few minutes of intention setting. Starting with setting plans or goals for your day will help you feel balanced and grounded before you get into the world of catching up on the news, or returning calls and emails. Spend a few minutes thinking of the goals that you would like to achieve today and set the tone for yourself.</p>
<h2>Eat Breakfast</h2>
<p>Once you’ve taken the time to set your goals, sit down and make yourself a nutritious breakfast. This usually means a breakfast full of variety. Sorry, but a donut and coffee doesn’t cut it anymore. Studies suggest that a rich and hearty breakfast can help improve mood and mental performance throughout your day. There may even be a <a href="https://qz.com/734307/the-perfect-breakfast-for-people-with-depression/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ideal breakfast for those living with depression</a> symptoms. Skipping breakfast altogether is not recommended. Those who regularly eat breakfast have been shown to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09637489809089415" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">have less depression, a lower stress response, and generally live healthier lives</a> than those who don’t.</p>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>After your breakfast settles, the next best thing you can do is to engage in some moderate exercise. If you’re feeling really full, you may want to avoid intense cardio (maybe save that for later), but a low-impact workout such as stretching or yoga can help loosen up muscles stiff from the night’s rest. Exercise can also <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/yoga-benefits-beyond-the-mat" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">lower your heart rate and blood pressure as well as make you less susceptible to the stress of the day</a>. After you’re done, be sure to take care of your daily grooming, like showering and brushing your teeth to help you feel fresh and rejuvenated.</p>
<h2>Do Your Mental Work</h2>
<p>If you are fortunate enough on your designated mental health day to take a day off from the office, now is a good time to engage in some mental work. This could include completing some challenging work from your to-do list or problem solving around some bigger tasks. With a well-balanced breakfast and some exercise under your belt for the day, you are primed to perform with focus and clarity. Take advantage of it and challenge yourself. In the end you’ll also end up feeling a great sense of achievement for putting forth effort, which is great for your mental health!</p>
<h2>Eat Lunch</h2>
<p>In the midst of that work, don’t forget to take some time a little later to eat a balanced lunch. This is a good time to work some leafy greens into your day as they help <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/eat-vegetables-nutrients-leafy-greens-prevent-dementia/story?id=51904727" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">slow down the process of cognitive decline and may even prevent dementia</a> long term.</p>
<p><a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/online-therapy-with-a-licensed-therapist?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_MID&amp;utr_adgroup=midpost-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=10559&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/12-best-ways-spend-mental-health-day-according-therapist/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4880 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png" alt="affordable blog purchase CTA" width="660" height="240" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png 660w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a></p>
<h2>Do Your Emotional Work</h2>
<p>This may also be a good time to tackle some of the emotional issues you’ve been facing. What are you going to do about the anxieties you face daily? How are you going to follow up with your boss after making a mistake at work? This is a good time to engage in some robust problem solving or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/reframing-therapy-effective-tool/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reframing</a>, otherwise you may spend your evening turning over these things in your mind, greatly impacting your restfulness and sleep.</p>
<h2>Socialize</h2>
<p>After lunch, get back to tackling some things on your to do list or you can spend time reconnecting with friends and loved ones. Spending time socializing is great for your mental health, whether that be going out with friends for a bike tour or spending time catching up with grandma. Making regular human contact is a big part of being mentally well. Social isolation is linked to several mental health conditions such as <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/01/what-causes-social-anxiety/" target="_blank">social anxiety</a> and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/dealing-depression-need-know/" target="_blank">depression</a>, among others. And if you don’t currently have friends or other loved ones that you can connect with, this is an opportunity to engage in a group activity to potentially make new friends.</p>
<h2>Take a Nap</h2>
<p>If you’re like me, then after engaging with friends and doing some work you may need a little down time. If you can swing it, why not take a short nap? <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1365-2869.2008.00718.x" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Naps have been long proven to positively impact mental performance</a>. Just don’t make it too long as it might disrupt your sleep for the evening. It only takes about <a href="https://sleep.org/articles/how-long-to-nap/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">20 minutes of napping to reap its benefits</a>, so keep it brief! If you’re not a fan of naps, this is also a good time just to delve into something that brings you joy. That can mean anything from reading a book to getting in some additional exercise or even practicing meditation. Whatever you choose, just make sure to utilize that time for yourself.</p>
<h2>Luxuriate and Eat a Light Dinner</h2>
<p>After a nap is good time to luxuriate in something you enjoy until dinner time. At dinner time eat a slightly lighter meal. <a href="http://theconversation.com/should-we-eat-breakfast-like-a-king-lunch-like-a-prince-and-dinner-like-a-pauper-86840" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eating less at night might be better for your weight, your glucose levels and metabolism</a>, helping you to get better rest and feel more balanced energy-wise. And we all know how hard it can be to be well when we don’t feel well!</p>
<h2>Reflect on the Day</h2>
<p>Spend the early evening hours winding down and taking it easy. Before bed, set aside some time to reflect on the day’s events or journal. <a href="http://vivawellnessblog.com/2018/05/17/feeling-down-practice-the-glad-technique-for-a-positive-boost/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Practicing the GLAD technique</a>, a gratitude practice that can help improve your mood, might help you with an extra dose of positivity and set you at peace before bed time.</p>
<h2>Practice Good Sleep Hygiene</h2>
<p>For many of us, the evenings are when all the not-so-great stuff tends to occur to us. Anxieties about work, personal issues or grief, or other emotional concerns tend to stake their claim on our evenings as we spend most of our days trying to fend off these ills. By making time earlier in the day to work through challenging emotional material, and leaving positive stuff for night time, we set up ourselves up for successful sleep.</p>
<p>These are just some points to consider in your mental health day. If you are able, it may be worth it to throw in an exercise class, some spa treatments or other holistic therapies to help you feel restored. This is a template for you to make them most of your next mental health day.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Therapists provide an incredibly valuable service: helping others work through issues and roadblocks, leading them toward more positive mental health and life experiences.</p>
<p>It’s almost superhuman how therapists work with their clients on such a deep level, while maintaining their energy at home, in their own personal lives, and confronting their own challenges.</p>
<p>We recently asked Talkspace therapists a few questions about how they support their own mental health and wellness. Did you know that therapists also seek therapy and counseling? Their answers, and more insight into the lives of therapists, are below.</p>
<p><span id="more-10516"></span></p>
<h2>How do you personally preserve your mental health, considering you help others do the same on a daily basis?</h2>
<p>“I’ve been a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a> for going on 25 years and know that maintaining my own mental health and practicing self care is vital, personally and professionally. Given the intensity of the work we do as therapists — being present for the pain, suffering, trauma, and despair of others, while actively working to help them — means that taking care of oneself is crucial in order to be present for my clients.</p>
<p>Just like on an airplane, you need to put your oxygen mask on first before assisting others.”</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Jill E Daino, LCSW (New York), Talkspace Therapist</em></p>
<p>“A quote by Dr. Sigmund Freud inevitably comes to mind, “no one who, like me, conjures up the most evil of those half-tamed demons that inhabit the human beast, and seeks to wrestle with them, can expect to come through the struggle unscathed.” After hearing that for the first time, I make sure to dedicate enough time to safeguard my mental health, with the goal of offering better services to my clients and surviving in a fast-paced profession.”</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Cynthia Catchings, LCSW-S (Virginia), Talkspace Therapist</em></p>
<p>“When I’m seeing clients, I make sure to take 5-minute “<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/mindfulness-therapy-improve-mental-health/" target="_blank">mindfulness</a>” breaks throughout my workday to make sure that I’m fully focused and present in my work with clients. I try it have a set “off” time each day—where I’m done responding to emails and doing anything work related.”</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Rachel O’Neill, Ph.D., LPCC-S (Ohio), Talkspace Therapist</em></p>
<h2>What does self-care look like for you as a therapist?</h2>
<p>“The years of being in supervision groups, personal therapy, and having trusted colleagues to openly discuss the impact the work has been invaluable. Without the ability to process what we hear, the pain and suffering of others sits within us and can be experienced as its own form of traumatization — or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/caregivers-can-avoid-burnout-stay-mentally-healthy/" target="_blank">compassion fatigue</a> as it is sometimes referred to in the literature.”</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Jill E Daino, LCSW</em></p>
<p>“One thing that I try to make my own is that my <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/7-self-care-tips-for-when-stress-affects-your-body/" target="_blank">list of self-care activities</a> is unique to my needs, interests, and likes. These activities include things that bring me pleasure and replenish me. If an activity encompass learning, traveling, and spirituality, it’s perfect for me.</p>
<p>Another important part of my self-care is my own personal therapeutic process. A therapist in therapy is most of the time a great therapist.”</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Cynthia Catchings, LCSW-S</em></p>
<p>“I work to engage in positive health self-care at least once a day. A few days a week, I go for a run. I spend quality time with my spouse and children. I read books that are not related to counseling at least occasionally. I also <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/08/why-working-with-a-therapist-is-different-than-talking-to-a-friend/" target="_blank">see a therapist</a> of my own every couple of months as a check in.”</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Christine Tolman, LPC</em></p>
<p><a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/online-therapy-with-a-licensed-therapist?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_MID&amp;utr_adgroup=midpost-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=3061&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/therapy-helped-me-forgive-my-mom/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4880 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png" alt="affordable blog purchase CTA" width="660" height="240" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png 660w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a></p>
<h2>How do you set boundaries between your work and your personal life, considering the weight of the subject matter in daily practice?</h2>
<p>“All therapists, including myself, have our particular credentialing field’s Code of Ethics. This Code of Ethics specifies that when we get licensed, we will be monitoring our own physical, psychological, social, and spiritual well-being when engaging with clients. If we want to provide our clients with the best possible sessions, we must be at our best, and to do that, we need to take care of ourselves.”</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Cynthia Catchings, LCSW-S</em></p>
<p>“I am very mindful about what I share with clients. If I feel it will help them, I will share a story from my personal life. If I am sharing because of a personal internal need, I check myself and do not share that information.”</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Christine Tolman, LPC</em></p>
<p>“I make sure that I have an off button. I care deeply about my clients — both past and present — but I also need to be able to leave my work at work. I try to have a bridge between home and work. Whether I’m working in my office or my home office, I try to take a few minutes at the end of each day to tie up any loose ends, review my <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/time-management-mental-health/" target="_blank">to-do list</a> for the next day, and give myself just a few minutes of breathing room before I transition into my other roles (wife, mother, friend).”</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Rachel O’Neill, Ph.D., LPCC-S</em></p>
<h2>What’s something beneficial you’ve learned in your practice with others that you now carry into your personal life?</h2>
<p>“One of the most helpful things that has been also beneficial in my own life is the use of small mindfulness practices. And given the availability of easy to use apps now, it’s that much more accessible for most people.”</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Jill E Daino, LCSW</em></p>
<p>“I have learned to be more compassionate and thoughtful in my experiences with strangers. Often the way you treat others says more about yourself than the other person, so I try not to personalize it when someone is not kind to me. I have also learned that almost everyone has insecurities of some kind, and it is not healthy to dwell on them. As a result, I feel more confident in my own abilities.”</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Christine Tolman, LPC</em></p>
<p>“I’ve learned that my clients are resilient. In order to be helpful to them, I need to be sure to incorporate <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/7-secrets-of-highly-resilient-people/" target="_blank">resiliency</a>, wellness, and self-care into my own life. It’s a little cliche, but I find it helpful to remind myself that self-care isn’t selfish. It’s okay to set boundaries. It’s okay to say no and It’s okay to have an off button.”</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Rachel O’Neill, Ph.D., LPCC-S</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mental health professionals often refer to the holiday season as the most difficult time of year for their clients. There is more in the air than the scent of fresh baked cookies. On the not-so-sweet side there are awkward family interactions, embarrassing past woes revealed, resurfacing childhood trauma, addiction relapse rampant — the list goes on.</p>
<p>People seem to get sicker this time of year, both mentally and physically. If you find the holidays tough and notice negative changes in your mental health, these tips will shed some light on strategies you can use to stay balanced.<span id="more-3430"></span></p>
<h2>#1: Know Your Symptoms, Look Out for Red Flags</h2>
<p>Before a negative mental health event such as a manic state, panic attack, or major depressive episode, there are subtle signs leading up to the occurrence. Preventative measures are key. You might notice you begin to slip out of your usual routine before the holiday. You might make more impulsive decisions or experience fatigue.</p>
<p>It is important for you to identify these behaviors so you may intervene before it’s too late as well as recognize whether this holiday is going to be a struggle. If holidays have been hard in the past, schedule a session with a mental health professional beforehand to identify and discuss your red flags.</p>
<h2>#2: The Past Often Predicts the Future</h2>
<p>This is especially true for family interactions. Negative interactions with family are among the biggest complaints therapists hear from clients around the holidays. If aunt Ann and cousin Betsy get into a screaming match every year, and every year it causes an increase in anxiety for you, it’s likely this could happen again. If a family member talks down to you each time your family is celebrating, which leads to a cascade of depressed feelings, you can bet you will hear it (and feel it) again this year.</p>
<p>In this case, knowledge is power. Try altering your usual plans if it is going to improve your well-being. Spend the holiday with your significant other’s family or a close friend. If that isn’t an option, have a fast exit strategy ready. Talk it over with your immediate supports prior to the gathering so everyone is on the same page.</p>
<p>If things start to heat up, have your exit signal ready. Avoid hosting gatherings if you know they typically turn out badly and there will be no escape. If you continue to encounter trouble, move on to strategy #3.</p>
<h2>#3 Be Your Authentic Self, Utilize Communication Skills</h2>
<p>When you’ve realized your symptoms have become unmanageable and there is seemingly no escape, it’s time for the ultimate strategy: authenticity and healthy communication skills.</p>
<p>Utilizing these skills will leave you with your pride intact and a strong sense of self, both of which are critical to a healthy mental state. Being your authentic self means following your gut and refusing to mask your feelings. If a situation is making you uncomfortable, avoid burying your head in the sand. It might sound scary, but it can be very freeing to unapologetically practice authenticity.</p>
<p>There is a right and wrong way to do this, and that’s where healthy communication comes into play. Try to use “I” statements that focus on you instead of whomever you’re addressing. This can help to lower defensiveness. Instead of saying, “You are such a jerk! I can’t stand you. You really need to change,” try, “When I was in your situation, it was hard for me to change. I was able to start making changes by…”</p>
<p>Another way to be a champion of communication is to eliminate cognitive distortions whenever possible. These are common maladaptive ways of thinking that all of us sometimes engage in. Two of the most popular are “Mind Reading” and “Fortune Telling,” both of which involve predicting negative outcomes and assumptions about what others are thinking. Eliminating these thoughts helps tremendously with development of healthy communication and lowering your own defense mechanisms. Find a full list of cognitive distortions <a href="http://www.apsu.edu/sites/apsu.edu/files/counseling/COGNITIVE_0.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> that you can identify and eliminate to help you master this holiday season.</p>
<p>Dealing with mental illness can make holidays more stressful, but it doesn’t have to. Practice these tips on your own or with a therapist!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Planning to do anything — even something fun and relaxing for the holidays — takes work and sometimes causes stress. Then you might want a vacation from the vacation.</p>
<p>Spending at least a day doing nothing is essential to having a restful holiday where your mind and body power down. But that’s only the beginning of why making time to do nothing over the holidays is great for your mental health.</p>
<p>Then there’s learning how you will actually do it and grappling with the definition of “nothing.” We’re aware of the irony of spending time strategizing how you will do nothing, but a quick read will be worth the reward.<span id="more-3410"></span></p>
<h2>What Does ‘Nothing’ Mean?</h2>
<p>Spending a day doing nothing means only concerning yourself with sleeping, eating and going to the bathroom. That’s it. It’s up to you whether reading, going on social media and watching your favorite shows are part of nothingness. If these activities have been stressful or made you feel bad, cut them out of your idle time!</p>
<h2>Burnout is Real — Doing Nothing Will Put Some Aloe Vera on that Burn</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3412 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/burnout-secondary_275_JR.jpg" alt="The Big Bang Theory burned" width="445" height="275" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/burnout-secondary_275_JR.jpg 445w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/burnout-secondary_275_JR-300x185.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px" /></p>
<p>Doing nothing gives you a chance to realize how burned out you are. It’s like going to the gym and waking up sore. Once you feel that ache, you can embrace it and let the nothingness soothe you.</p>
<p>Here is the short list of physical and mental health benefits of taking some time to waste some time:</p>
<ul>
<li>happier mood</li>
<li>decreased heart rate</li>
<li>replenishes oxygen and glucose to the brain</li>
<li>better digestion</li>
</ul>
<h2>You’ll Be More Productive Later On</h2>
<p>Did you know J.P. Morgan, someone you might imagine was busy 365 days a year, actually took two months of vacation every year?</p>
<p>“I can get done in 10 months what I could never do in 12,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Returning to work rested will make you more productive during those hours. It’s all about quality over quantity, so don’t try to chip away at work during your “doing nothing time.”</p>
<h2>It Might Provide Your Best Idea Yet</h2>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-3419 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/incubation-idea_275_JR.jpg" alt="incubation good idea light bulb" width="412" height="275" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/incubation-idea_275_JR.jpg 412w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/incubation-idea_275_JR-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our minds need time to incubate and hatch our best ideas. Being idle is a chance for that eureka moment.</p>
<h2>It’s a Chance to Get to Know Yourself</h2>
<p>When people sit around and let their worries flutter way, the introspection begins. This is a chance to learn new things that make you happy, relieved, relaxed and enlightened. It could be staring at a garden, taking a walk, listening to a podcast or setting a personal record for sleeping in.</p>
<h2>How to Ensure You Have Time to Chill</h2>
<p>Part of making time to be idle is saying “no” to people. If someone calls during your “do nothing day,” maybe don’t pick up unless it’s an emergency. Only say “yes” to once-in-a-lifetime invites.</p>
<p>Your time is valuable, so spend some of it treating yourself to the gift of complete inactivity.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-3414 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/office-space-secondary_275_JR.jpg" alt="Office Space doing nothing Peter" width="367" height="275" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/office-space-secondary_275_JR.jpg 367w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/office-space-secondary_275_JR-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 367px) 100vw, 367px" /></p>
<p>It’s the only gift that rivals our <a href="https://giftcard.talkspace.com/" target="_blank">holiday gift card</a>, but only if you <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/12/right-way-send-someone-talkspace-e-gift-card/" target="_blank">give it the right way</a>.</p>
