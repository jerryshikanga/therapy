				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re anything like me, you have a routine set in place from the moment you wake up.</p>
<p><i>Open eyes. </i></p>
<p><i>Check the dog&#8230;yep, still breathing. </i></p>
<p><i>Roll over and check on my boyfriend — yup, he’s still breathing, too. </i></p>
<p><i>From there, I immediately grab my phone and open each social media app to see what breaking news I’ve missed over the last, oh, six hours, and then begin my day. </i></p>
<p>Some of my routines, the morning workout, might be beneficial, but the more I work on my mental health, the more I realize that some of my <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/ways-youre-making-life-harder-than-needs-be/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">daily habits</a> could potentially be harming my well-being. Charles Duhigg, author of <i>The Power of Habit </i>and former business writer for the New York<i> Times</i>, writes that “Routines are the organizational analogue of habits,” and that starting new habits can be as difficult as breaking bad ones — but that harnessing the power of routine can have powerful effects on both productivity and our mental state.</p>
<p><span id="more-10569"></span></p>
<p>Below, we’ll discuss a few of the most common habits, how they might be harming your mental health, and how to improve them.</p>
<h2>Scrolling our Instagram Feed</h2>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it crazy how scrolling across your Instagram feed is an autopilot response when you first wake up, when you’re commuting on public transit, killing a few moments during lunch, or just sitting at your desk? I catch myself doing this regularly during any lull in my day. While this may seem like a typical habit, it could be a <a href="http://time.com/4793331/instagrawm-social-media-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">contributing factor to your depression and brain fog</a>. When you scroll through your insta-feed as often as I do, it can cause you to compare your life to the lives of others, your body to the next Insta-fit model, or your mellow Friday night to someone else&#8217;s night out on the town.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/managing-social-media-intake-without-quitting/" target="_blank">Social media</a> depression is more common that many realize. It&#8217;s easy to feel down about your life when you are scrolling through everyone else&#8217;s highlight reel.</p>
<h2>Complaining to Everyone (and Yourself)</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s healthy to express yourself, even if you’re feeling frustrated or upset, but negative thought patterns can be destructive. The reason: negative thoughts breed more negative thoughts, which leads to a negative attitude and cynical outlook on life.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to be mindful of how often we&#8217;re complaining to others as well. While some commiseration is healthy, too much can lead to negative ruminations. Complaining can be a difficult habit to break, especially if your friends or co-workers thrive on lamenting to one another during a coffee break. It&#8217;s important to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/women-s-mental-health-matters/201509/7-ways-deal-negative-thoughts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">stop these negative thoughts </a>as they happen to break the cycle. Practice gratitude, by thinking of the things that you’re thankful for (sounds cliche, I know), or jotting down positive mantras in your planner or journal.</p>
<p><a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/online-therapy-with-a-licensed-therapist?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_MID&amp;utr_adgroup=midpost-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=10569&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/5-daily-habits-that-are-actually-hurting-your-mental-health/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4880 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png" alt="affordable blog purchase CTA" width="660" height="240" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png 660w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a></p>
<h2>Weighing Yourself Every Morning</h2>
<p>Staying active and maintaining a healthy weight is an excellent goal, but there is a fine line between monitoring your weight and becoming obsessed with the numbers on the scale. Weighing yourself daily often leads to<a href="http://time.com/4106738/weight-scale-body-issues/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> obsessive thoughts</a> about weight fluctuation. What seems like a normal part of your morning can, if engaged routinely without care, lead to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/how-to-stop-obsessive-thinking/" target="_blank">obsessive thoughts</a> about your body image and weight fluctuations.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve struggled with this since I was a teenager, and have had to break the cycle with the help of my therapist and an accountability partner. Our weight can change daily based on food intake, water weight, hormone shifts, and even the time of day, so cut yourself some slack and ease off the scale!</p>
<h2>Using Your Phone Before Bed</h2>
<p>If your cell phone is the first thing in your hand when you wake up and the last thing in your hand before your head hits the pillow, you may find yourself battling restlessness and insomnia. This is because our phones<a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> stimulate our brains</a>, keeping the mind active and alert for up to two hours from the last time you last used your cell phone.</p>
<p>Combat restlessness and overstimulation by stopping the use of your phone at least an hour before you fall asleep. Replace that time spent scrolling by reading a book (not on a tablet), coloring in an adult coloring book, meditating, or journaling.</p>
<h2>Drinking Caffeine Before Your Commute</h2>
<p>Does your high-traffic commute down the central expressway or public transportation trigger <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/commute-tips-to-let-go" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">nervousness and anxiety</a>? Your morning cup of joe may be the culprit. While caffeine increases alertness and focus, it can also stimulate <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/how-to-get-rid-of-anxiety-separating-good-bad/" target="_blank">anxiety symptoms</a> such as heart palpitations, elevated temperature (ever feel like you&#8217;re getting a hot flash on the train?), uneasiness, and shortness of breath.</p>
<p>Commuter&#8217;s tip: hold off on the double espresso until you&#8217;re at your office and have navigated the morning rat race. Replace your usual commuters beverage with something calming, like an herbal tea or bottle of lemon water instead.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to break these small, yet impactful daily habits that may be impacting your mental health. The best way to recalibrate your daily routine is to maintain a state of mindfulness so that you can easily correct whatever habit you’re trying to break. By committing to a healthier routine — with fewer interruptions, distractions, and a little less <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/why-reach-for-phone-constantly/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">stimulation</a> — you’ll be giving yourself a more balanced, less chaotic lifestyle.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are several weeks into 2018 and this is as good as time as any to check in with yourself about your mental health goals. It can be difficult to begin and maintain progress through your goals, especially this time of year, as we all try to regain our footing with our day-to-day schedules and responsibilities.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s incredibly important to take some time to reflect and re-group to see where you are with your mental health resolutions. Taking time to assess your progress is an invaluable part of the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/12/getting-2018-smart-goals-mental-health-resolutions/" target="_blank">goal-setting process</a>. Moving forward takes routine, evaluation, and consistent checking in.</p>
<p>So, how are you doing with your goals? Here are a few questions that you may want to begin by asking yourself.</p>
<p><span id="more-8918"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>How have I been able to work towards my goals so far?</li>
<li>What has worked so far? What hasn’t? And what needs to be changed?</li>
<li>Looking at my mental health goals long-term, do they follow the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/12/getting-2018-smart-goals-mental-health-resolutions/">SMART model </a>or are there things that I need to change to make them more efficient?</li>
<li>For the progress that I’ve made (and will make), how can I reward myself or create intentional opportunities for positive reinforcement?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.livestrong.com/article/1007023-operant-conditioning-can-affect-adolescent-development/" target="_blank">Positive reinforcement </a>is, by far the best way that we can do to motivate and make new behavior stick. As a therapist, I find that too often my clients struggle with finding motivation to work towards their goals and keep the process moving. Often they’re self critical and get down when there are setbacks. What they often miss are opportunities for rewards or reinforcement that are well thought out and planned throughout their goal-achieving process.</p>
<p>When most of us set goals, especially ones related to mental health, we envision attaining the goal as THE reward. While this may or may not be true, it can be hard to maintain motivation and patience as you do the very challenging work of improving one’s mental health. Therefore, why not periodically set up some small rewards along the way that will help you feel good, even if you have slip ups or get discouraged?</p>
<p>For example, if you’re hoping to get better control of your anxiety and self-critical thoughts, that can be tough work! Perhaps part of your plan is to check in with your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/" target="_blank">online therapist </a>regularly or read a self-help book to help you achieve that goal. Everyday life can certainly be disruptive in reaching your goal, which means it&#8217;s going to take intense concentration and focus to get to the end goal of managing your thoughts differently.</p>
<p>Therefore, setting up some small treats for yourself along the way might be helpful in sustaining your motivation and energy. For instance, you might gift yourself a nice dinner out after attending therapy for a month or working through the first quarter of your self-help book. Halfway through your process, you might schedule a massage or take a mental health day from work (or both!) so that you get some extra rest and downtime. No matter what rewards you put into place, you will be practicing self-care along the way and working towards your goal of treating yourself better. It’s a win-win.</p>
<p>And let’s not forget that if your mental health resolution progress has already slowed, it’s OK. Many of us are in the same boat. The good news is that every moment presents a new opportunity to start anew. You don’t have to be held prisoner by missteps. It’s never too late to regroup and start again.</p>
<p>After all, you deserve it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taking care of our mental health requires a 360-degree approach to our overall wellness. It’s important to look at everything you can do to feel well and healthy.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Food is the most widely abused anti-anxiety drug in America, and <strong>exercise is the most potent yet underutilized antidepressant</strong>” &#8211; Bill Phillips, Author and Entrepreneur</p></blockquote>
<p>Here are the top five benefits of exercise that will have you lacing up your sneakers before you read the final sentence.<span id="more-3546"></span></p>
<h2>Reduces Stress and Alleviates Anxiety</h2>
<p>Exercise can help manage physical and mental stress.</p>
<p>Working out increases levels of norepinephrine, the chemical in your brain that moderates the brain’s response to stress. So in addition to helping you burn through the feelings of being stressed out, exercise helps you manage your response to stressful situations.</p>
<p>Brain chemicals, including norepinephrine and endorphins, that are released during and after exercise can have a calming effect for people who experience anxiety.</p>
<h2>Boosts Happy Chemicals</h2>
<p>Endorphins, the powerful chemicals in your brain that are released during exercise, boost your spirits and create feelings of happiness and levity.</p>
<h2>Boosts Brainpower, Sharpens Memory and Prevents Cognitive Decline</h2>
<p>Exercise can help protect the brain against cognitive decline as we age. Working out boosts the chemicals in the brain that support and prevent degeneration of the hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for memory and learning.</p>
<p>Research shows cardiovascular exercise can create new brain cells and improve overall brain performance. And the same brain chemicals that boost your mood can also help you concentrate and feel mentally sharp.</p>
<h2>Improves Sleep</h2>
<p>Sometimes lingering stress and anxiety interferes with our ability to sleep. Regular exercise, even short bursts of movement in the day, can help you relax into a more easygoing sleep pattern.</p>
<h2>Fuels Energy, Improves Focus and Drives Productivity</h2>
<p>People who take time for some kind of physical activity on a regular basis have more energy and are more productive than those people who are more sedentary.</p>
<p>Make a plan to exercise this week. Your body, mind and mood will thank you!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Imagine someone you love dearly &#8211; your child, parent, sibling, or another relative &#8211; being diagnosed with cancer. It’s hard to place yourself in that position, and to think about what you would do if it were to happen. What support would we need in place? What would we do if that were our family member?</h2>
<p><em>&#8211; by Carrie Miller, LCSW / Talkspace Therapist</em></p>
<p>Childhood cancer is a topic that is close to my heart, as my now 6 year old nephew is a survivor of <a title="Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia" href="http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/acute-promyelocytic-leukemia" target="_blank">Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia</a>. He was diagnosed at the age of 2. The moment that my sister and her husband got the news that “something isn’t right”, their hearts sank. They were terrified and had questions that the doctors could not yet answer for them; they were stuck in a hospital two hours away from home and had to leave another child with the grandparents to be there. The worst part was they were not sure about what came next. Calls went out to other family members, friends, and anyone else who could send support and offer a helping hand.<span id="more-2842"></span></p>
<h4>In times like these, when our worst nightmares come to fruition, what can others do to provide support to the family and friends of a loved one with cancer in the most practical way?</h4>
<p><strong>How can a therapist, extended family member, friend, doctor, or clergy member provide the most valuable support to those who are supporting their loved one during such a vulnerable time?</strong></p>
<p>I can imagine that any parent who has a child (or loved one) diagnosed with cancer is feeling beyond terrified. A cancer diagnosis, especially for many children, often does not have a positive outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most people are more familiar with adult forms of cancer, and may not be aware of the fact that <strong>the “cure rate” or remission rate for childhood cancers is much lower. This has to do with the fact that research for childhood cancers is <a title="Filling the Funding Gap" href="http://www.stbaldricks.org/filling-the-funding-gap/" target="_blank">highly underfunded</a></strong>. The following is information I would like to share with you in regards to the number of diagnosed cases, the most common types of childhood cancers, and their survival rates.</p>
<p>The good news is that the survival rate has increased from 10% in 1965 to nearly 90% in 2015. However, for some types of childhood cancers the rates are much lower. That being said, the number of diagnosed cases has not declined in nearly 20 years, with roughly <a title="Childhood Cancer Statistics – Graphs and Infographics" href="http://curesearch.org/Childhood-Cancer-Statistics" target="_blank">43 children</a> being diagnosed with cancer per day.</p>
<h4>The <a title="The National Children's Cancer Society " href="http://www.thenccs.org/childhood-cancer-facts?gclid=Cj0KEQjwy7qrBRC4lp7_hM3dgIoBEiQA72pCngwNOYPJA2YmQtkVCaLqZGDVvXPN4uXGpo5lws_dAUEaAu1s8P8HAQ" target="_blank">causes</a> of most childhood cancers are unknown, and they are not strongly linked to the environment or lifestyle choices, as it is with many adult cancers, which make them very difficult to treat.</h4>
<p>As a <a title="Cancer in Children" href="http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancerinchildren/detailedguide/cancer-in-children-types-of-childhood-cancers" target="_blank">reference</a>, the following is some information on a few of the most common types of childhood cancers. Leukemia (cancers of the blood and bone marrow) accounts for 30% of all childhood cancers. Next, brain and central nervous system tumors make up about 26% of childhood cancers. Then, Neuroblastoma, cancer that starts in early forms of nerve cells, makes up about 6% of all childhood cancers. Lastly, Lymphoma which is a cancer that begins in cells of the immune system called lymphocytes and causes lymph nodes to swell – in particular, non-Hodgkin Lymphoma accounts for about 5% of childhood cancers.</p>
<h4><strong><em>How Can You Provide Support?</em></strong></h4>
<p><strong>The path can be lonely for those who have to walk it alone or with limited support systems. </strong></p>

<p>There are things that they will need that, before their child or loved one was diagnosed with cancer, they may have never thought twice about. The laundry, for example, or help preparing meals. Something as simple as having 10 extra minutes to play with their child, who is not sick in the hospital, can be of immeasurable benefit.</p>
<p>Too often, parents are also isolated within the confines of the hospital, so that their child can receive the much needed medical attention for long periods of time. This can become quite lonely. So, how can you provide support?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>If you are a friend or an extended family member, you can offer to visit your family in the hospital if you have some extra time. Small gestures of support like this are especially meaningful and appreciated.</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>You could also ask if you can provide meals for their home. Often times, when you are caring for a loved one with cancer, you spend many days and nights in the hospital and don’t have the time or energy to cook meals. This kind gesture can be especially helpful.</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Offer to do a load of laundry for them. These are also things that tend to go undone when the family is caring for someone who is very ill. It might seem silly to ask, but the extra support would be very much appreciated.</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Just be there with them. If you are wondering to yourself, “What do I say to them? How can I possibly say anything helpful or supportive?” It’s okay. There are no magic words you can utter during these times that will ease the pain and anxiety they feel. Your presence and support speaks volumes and means more than any words you could offer.</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Social workers can offer support by assisting family members with tasks such as connecting with support groups, financial assistance (i.e. Medicade, Social Security Disability), or other supportive services, like music, movement, talk therapy, or art therapy if needed.</h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s the little things that count: bringing them a home-cooked meal, donating a gift card if finances are tight, offering to sit with them at the hospital so they don’t feel isolated, asking if they need help caring for their other children, or letting them know that you are keeping them in your thoughts and prayers.</p>

<p>These things mean a lot to families who feel depleted and frightened of the uncertainty that lies ahead. Simply extending your hand, and being with them in their most difficult moments, without saying a word, can be just the support and assurance that they need.</p>
