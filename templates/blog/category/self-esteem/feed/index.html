				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Confidence is elusive for many people. There are many factors that can undermine confidence, but most of them are related to your past experiences in the world — first as a child and then as an adult — and how these experiences have led you to think of yourself.</p>
<p>There are many successful, intelligent people who think that they are “losers,” believing they’ll be discovered as inadequate by those around them. If this describes you, you may be wondering how to release these negative thought patterns and grow more confident.</p>
<p><span id="more-11371"></span></p>
<h2>How to Increase Your Confidence</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for constructive ideas on how to make lasting changes to your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/5-ways-improve-body-image-confidence-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confidence</a>, here are few ways to do so&#8230;</p>
<h3>Look at things objectively</h3>
<p>The first step to increasing your confidence is to take an objective look at your strengths and weaknesses. Often, you can utilize objective measures for this.</p>
<p>For instance, if you’re <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxious</a> about your job performance and feel like you’re always disappointing your team or company, take a hard look at your performance evaluations over the years. Many times, people with low confidence <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/09/imposter-syndrome-prevents-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">underestimate their actual achievement levels</a>. Looking at objective data can help you understand what you actually need to work on, versus where you’re already doing well.</p>
<p>For some people, it can be reassuring to look at past successes. Continuing with the example above, they arrive at a more rational thought process, thinking “Well, I have always done well on presentations in the past, never gotten much negative feedback at all, so there’s no reason to this that this upcoming presentation will be any different.”</p>
<h3>Assess your current relationships</h3>
<p>Next, you need to look closely at who you surround yourself with. If there are many <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/6-traits-toxic-people/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toxic people</a> in your life, you may need to think deeply about how they are impacting your self-esteem and general emotional health.</p>
<p>For example, if a woman who feels terrible about her <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/09/talk-about-looks-damaging-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">body image</a> sees her mother multiple times a week, and her mother always comments about her weight, this relationship could be sabotaging her chances of increasing her body confidence.</p>
<p>In this case, there are multiple approaches that she could take, including openly and assertively <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/guide-setting-healthy-boundaries-relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">setting boundaries</a> with her mom about which topics, like her weight, are off the table. Another approach might be limiting contact to once a week and seeing if there is any corresponding change in her <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/self-esteem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-esteem</a> levels.</p>
<h3>Address your past</h3>
<p>Also, it is essential to look back into your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/turn-childhood-hardship-success-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early life</a> and think deeply about what messages you received about your capabilities when growing up. Often, people with low confidence have grown up in households where they were implicitly or explicitly told that they were incompetent.</p>
<p>For instance, a boy could have been told by his dad that he was “book smart but not street smart.” Even if this was not said with bad intentions, it likely shaped how this boy thought about throughout his childhood, and later as an adult. He may feel that he can’t do more practical things, and should stick to the realm of academic achievement.</p>
<p>Figuring out what’s at the root of his lack of self-confidence in this area can be transformative, and allow him to finally try things that are outside of his comfort zone.</p>
<h2>Therapy as a Solution for Confidence Issues</h2>
<p>Therapy can be extremely useful in helping you discover the origin of your confidence issues. A skilled <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">therapist</a> can also work with you on creating small, incremental goals that help you to slowly build your confidence and your experience of mastery in the world.</p>
<p>Don’t let low self-confidence undermine your life. The best gift you can give yourself is the ability to understand yourself clearly, through introspection and therapeutic work. This can lead to self-awareness of what you’re already good at, and openness to tackle areas of your life that may need some work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m a pretty confident gal. Actually, that’s an understatement. I am a seriously confident woman. I think I’m gorgeous, exceptionally talented, super interesting, and not least of all, <i>very</i> humble.</p>
<p>I’m lucky to have a fantastic mom, who always modelled body confidence, never talked about weight, and told me I was the most beautiful woman in the world (well, except for my equally beautiful sisters). My partners have never made me feel bad about my body. I go for a “queer, curvier <a href="https://fr.lumas.com/pictures/vittorio_de_sica/mara_of_rome_sophia_loren/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sophia Loren in 1964</a>” vibe, and I’m pretty pleased with the results.</p>
<p>And yet&#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-10705"></span></p>
<h2>Internal and External Pressures</h2>
<p>And yet, I am a woman in contemporary American culture with a BMI over 25 (the dreaded <a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/body-mass-index-bmi#lp-h-2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">boundary</a> between “normal” and “overweight”). And yet, shopping for pants is an unpleasant affair, with every resisting zipper a judgement. And yet, when my doctor told me it couldn’t hurt for me to lose a few pounds, I said, “Listen lady, if I have to choose between my <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/why-weight-loss-resolutions-are-dangerous-to-mental-health/" target="_blank">mental health and losing weight</a>, I will choose my mental health every time.”</p>
<p>It really does feel like this is the choice.</p>
<p>Trying to lose weight — trying to do anything much to alter my appearance, in fact, besides my usual makeup-pencil skirt-rhinestone routine — <i>stresses me the heck out</i>. I like to exercise (when it’s fun stuff, like Zumba, and not boring stuff, like jogging). I like to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/how-to-eat-your-way-to-mental-health/" target="_blank">eat fruits and vegetables</a>. But if you put me in a room full of women talking about their diets, counting calories, or shaming themselves for eating too many Christmas cookies (&#8230;no such thing?), insecurity alarm bells start screeching in my head.</p>
<p>What gives?</p>
<h2>The Root of Decreasing Body Satisfaction</h2>
<p>Turns out, I’m not alone. The majority of Americans feel somewhat dissatisfied with their bodies, with only 28% of men, and 26% of women feel “extremely satisfied” with their appearance, and only half <a href="http://time.com/4352400/men-women-body-image/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reporting</a> that they’re “somewhat to extremely satisfied” with their weight.</p>
<p>Social pressure can make this worse. “Fat talk” and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471015314001548" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">comparing ourselves to others</a> have been <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/eat.10171" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">repeatedly</a> shown to increase and <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/213a/9cf598aa01e8ac38bf410f4d3a2aac202770.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">normalize</a> body dissatisfaction. Meanwhile, exposure to traditional and social media is significantly related to decreased body satisfaction in both <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stacey_Tantleff-Dunn/publication/247839476_The_Impact_of_Media_Exposure_on_Males%27_Body_Image/links/02e7e53a9f7cd8d443000000.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">men</a> and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eat.22141" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">women</a>.</p>
<p>Fat shaming, though often described in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/04/question-being-fat-battling-better-healthcare" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">faux-benevolent</a> language of “concern” about fat people’s health, actually has a negative effect on fat people’s <a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2017/january/fat-shaming-linked-to-greater-health-risks" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">physical and emotional</a> wellbeing — in turn decreasing the likelihood that they’ll lose weight even if they want to.</p>
<p>The best kind of body talk? No body talk at all, say experts.</p>
<h2>The Talk on “Body Talk”</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/23/moms-daughters-influence-body-image/2690921/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">experts</a> on raising children with healthy body image, parents shouldn’t talk about their children’s weight, but they also shouldn’t shame themselves or model harmful dieting practices. Instead, they should emphasize healthy eating, healthy physical activity, and positive personality traits in order to <a href="http://www.pbs.org/parents/parenting/raising-girls/body-image-identity/raising-a-girl-with-a-positive-body-image/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">teach a more holistic relationship</a> with the body.</p>
<p>If you already have a negative relationship with your body, <a href="http://self-compassion.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Daye.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">research has shown</a> that some kinds of talk can help: specifically, self-compassion and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-how-is-it-conducted-online/" target="_blank">cognitive behavioral therapy</a>. Writing in <i>Psychology</i>, therapist Vivian Diller <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/face-it/201202/3-ways-raise-your-beauty-self-esteem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">recommends</a> paying attention to and transforming negative thoughts as one way to improve our “beauty self-esteem.” She suggests looking in the mirror and noticing what we think about ourselves, positive and negative. Then, rewrite negative dialogues as though you were talking to your child or best friend — to someone who you believe is beautiful and perfect just the way they are.</p>
<p>This research makes a lot of sense to me. The (relatively infrequent) occasions when I do feel self-conscious about my looks aren’t when I’m in a bikini on the beach, or in dance class wearing only a sports bra, or naked with a partner. <i>Living </i>in my body is sheer joy: my legs stretch, my thighs pump, my hips shake. There is nothing better than walking down a street with the sunshine on my face, eating a perfect peach.</p>
<p>Hearing other people complain about their bodies, on the other hand, is the surest killer of personal confidence. It’s only when I see pictures of other women complaining about their “flab,” or sharing weight-loss strategies, or shaming themselves for eating dinner that I pay attention to the so-called flaws in my <i>own </i>body.</p>
<p>In these moments, I’m reminded that the body isn’t the problem: society is.</p>
<h2>We Must Learn to Recognize Our Own Beauty</h2>
<p>The body is not to be agonized over, picked apart, punished, obsessed about. It is meant to be enjoyed. As John Mayer famously said in a slightly different context, the “body is a wonderland.” We can eat delicious things, exchange backrubs with friends, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/5-reasons-masturbation-destressing/" target="_blank">masturbate</a>, and dance. We can make children, climb mountains, and swim seas.</p>
<p>We’re born at home in our bodies. Babies kick and gurgle and feed, delighted by the colors and textures of the world. Toddlers run around naked without fear or shame, jumping and dancing and eating just for the love of it.</p>
<p>Society takes that pleasure away from us. But that’s not inevitable. Developing a more body-positive society begins with each one of us. By finding joy in our own bodies, we give others permission to discover that childlike wonder for themselves.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever noticed how easy it is for us to feel down on ourselves? We generally don’t have a problem feeling guilty about what we perceive as poor performance. Whether the misstep is big or small, punishing oneself seems to come naturally for many. But when it comes to feeling proud about accomplishing something, it is easy to let the moment slip through our fingertips.</p>
<p>This discrepancy is a problem, as it decreases our motivation and makes it that much harder to achieve long-term successes.</p>
<p><span id="more-10496"></span></p>
<h2>The Importance of Celebrating Small Wins</h2>
<p>Celebrating small wins is an important way to track incremental achievements and work toward much larger goals. Plus, it makes you feel good more often.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/05/the-power-of-small-wins" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study</a> of how everyday life inside organizations can influence a person’s performance, researchers analyzed nearly 12,000 diary entries from 238 employees across seven companies. They found that capturing small wins every day enhances a worker’s motivation. Simply recording progress in some way helps to boost self-confidence and can be put to use toward future successes.</p>
<h3>How our Brain Rewards us for These Victories</h3>
<p>There is science behind this thought process too. When you accomplish something, it activates the reward center of our brains, allowing us to feel a sense of pride. Specifically, the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/ways-stomach-microbiome-impacts-mental-health/" target="_blank">neurochemical dopamine</a> is released and energizes us with feel-good emotions. This chemical helps you to experience the feeling of getting rewarded, and can hook you on wanting to achieve even more.</p>
<p>These modest <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/control-emotions-cognitive-behavioral-therapy/" target="_blank">behavior changes</a> set off a positive chain reaction for even bigger developments later on.</p>
<p><a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/online-therapy-with-a-licensed-therapist?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_MID&amp;utr_adgroup=midpost-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=10496&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/why-you-should-celebrate-small-wins/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4880 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png" alt="affordable blog purchase CTA" width="660" height="240" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png 660w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a></p>
<h2>Small Wins to Get You Started</h2>
<p>To set off the positive domino effect, start by celebrating small wins each day. Listed below are just a few examples of simple ways you can start to think small.</p>
<h3>1. Straighten up your bed before you leave the house</h3>
<p>When you complete this simple task, it incites a nice burst of dopamine first thing in the morning. This sparks the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/healthy-morning-routine-benefit-mental-health/" target="_blank">initial feeling of accomplishment</a>, which is carried throughout the day. The other positive is that your room will be ready for relaxation when you return in the evening.</p>
<h3>2. Will it take less than two minutes? Check it off now</h3>
<p>When you are able to cross <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/how-setting-micro-goals-can-increase-happiness/" target="_blank">minor to-do’s off your list</a>, do it. This basic act can help build momentum and propel you forward to accomplish much larger tasks later on. The other positive is getting that surge of dopamine each time something is crossed off your list, no matter how minor.</p>
<h3>3. Take time to daydream</h3>
<p>Taking time to reflect internally is linked with your emotional well-being. This can help you come up with creative ideas and consolidate memories. . As long as the reflection is constructive, it is a small way to have a positive impact.</p>
<h3>4. Improve your posture</h3>
<p>It only takes a moment, but straightening your posture throughout the day can help you feel present and accomplished, whether you are seated at your desk or on the move.</p>
<h2>Don’t Forget to Celebrate!</h2>
<p>Each time you set a small goal like the ones listed above, take the time to pause and celebrate when you actually achieve one. You may want to consider some light bragging to mark the achievement, to help reflect on how far you’ve come from the start of a project.</p>
<p>Even if they take just 5 to 10 minutes, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/checking-in-on-your-mental-health-resolutions/" target="_blank">small wins</a> can stack up over time and become significant markers of progress and happiness.</p>

<p>I sat back in my chair, quickly allowing a movie reel of life events that could potentially cause her to ask me such a thing. I quickly realized her pointed question was entirely valid.</p>
<p>I was straddling a thin line between breaking through in my career and remaining stagnant. I had an inbox overflowing with opportunities to guest speak, press and media interviews, and a book pre-order list a mile high — all of which I had yet to reply to.</p>
<p>I sat back, reflected quickly, then replied with a snarky rebuttal:</p>
<p>“I’m a self-saboteur, you know.”</p>
<p><span id="more-10468"></span></p>
<p>Is it just me, or has society glamorized self-sabotage? Social media posts and memes mock our seemingly inherent need to destroy the good things in life. Pop songs romanticize being afraid to be happy. And how many romantic comedies depict a female co-star who is unsatisfied with her life, spurns happiness, and sabotages her potential love interests?</p>
<p>It’s everywhere, and somewhere along the line it was determined that self-sabotage is not only typical but humorous. When we actually experience it, however, it can leave us feeling victimized and helpless.</p>
<h2>What is Self-Sabotage?</h2>
<p>Psychology Today defines self-sabotage as behavior that “creates problems and interferes with long-standing goals.”</p>
<p>Self-sabotage can be any sort of behavior that blocks success in any category of your life, such as your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/5-ways-exercise-is-great-for-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">health and fitness goals</a>, success at work, your daily routine and productivity level, and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/relationship-how-to-maintain-independence/" target="_blank">within relationships</a> both romantic and platonic — it can even include your relationship with yourself.</p>
<p>Let’s detail some common self-sabotage scenarios, to help understand how we can avoid this cycle in the future.</p>
<h2>Self-Sabotage and Success at Work</h2>
<p>You know you have a deadline coming up that will be crucial to meet if you want that year-end bonus. You have your calendar and project management tool set with reminder after reminder, but you keep justifying it to yourself that you’ll “get to it later.”</p>
<p>The part of you that yearns to succeed in your career sets up these calendar reminders, but the part of you that is apprehensive or afraid to move forward at your job procrastinates so that you miss these crucial deadlines.</p>
<p>Everything you had to succeed was there, so why sabotage what should have been an easy win?</p>
<h2>Self-Sabotage and Success with Your Wellness Goals</h2>
<p>Most of us know what it takes to obtain a better level of fitness and strength. Even if this area of expertise is not our forte, there are thousands of resources available to us online, at the bookstore, and on social media channels.</p>
<p>We know what it takes to not pack on extra weight by sticking to the plan our trainer set for us. Yet, one might find themselves having that extra doughnut at your office’s lunch break, or cancelling your fitness class the night before because you Netflix binged until 2 a.m.</p>
<p>Why do we do this to ourselves?</p>
<h2>Self-Sabotage in your Mental Health Journey</h2>
<p>Whether you have a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/" target="_blank">Talkspace therapist</a>, an in-office therapist, or are just working on your mental health privately, we each have goals in our self-help and self-awareness journey. These goals allow us to take the next step in achieving a higher level of mental wellness and self-actualization.</p>
<p>You know what it takes to keep your stress and anxiety in check, yet you reach for the extra cup of coffee, don’t get enough sleep, text back that toxic ex, or don’t eat right during a crazy day. Most of these behaviors cause you to feel awful the next day.</p>
<p>So why didn’t we take that moment to breathe and recalibrate our mind?</p>
<h2>Quitting the Self-Sabotage Cycle</h2>
<p>The first step in <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/4-signs-youre-self-sabotaging-how-to-stop/" target="_blank">stopping the cycle of self-sabotage</a> is to recognize you’re doing it.</p>
<p>The second step is to spend some time figuring out why you allow self-sabotage to take place.</p>
<p>We know what it takes to stop an unhealthy pattern, behavior, or cycle — so why do we continue to do it? For some, it may be fear of change or more responsibility. For others, it may be the fact that they don’t value themselves enough to make positive changes. For many of us, it’s that we become so discouraged living in this vicious cycle that we feel too overwhelmed to make any changes.</p>
<p>The third step is to recognize when this behavior is taking place so you can cut it off before the downward spiral begins. Self-sabotage is like any other bad habit, it needs to be worked through, and the bad habit “starved” for you to start to see the positive changes.</p>
<h2>If Self-Sabotage is Affecting You, Make a Change</h2>
<p>Self-sabotage is more common than most of us realize, and it creeps into every avenue of our life, including the most pivotal ones. Regardless of how self-sabotage has affected each of us, the avenues to correct this and change course towards a healthier, more successful life applies to each scenario.</p>
<p>If you need help breaking free of self-sabotage, consider talking with a therapist. They&#8217;re equipped with the tools and training to reduce negative thought patterns that stand between you and your success.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It happens to everyone: something makes you feel so terrible, so embarrassed and ashamed — and you feel you will never be able to live it down. Sometimes you may not even have done anything, but someone condescended to you, wrote a clipped email or called you out on your behavior in a way that led to your feeling hopeless or wanting to hide.</p>
<p>Often it feels like no matter what you do in the midst of shame, you can’t move past <em>that</em> <em>feeling</em>, and you start thinking about other ways that you have disappointed or embarrassed yourself or others. This is called a shame spiral.</p>
<p><span id="more-9250"></span></p>
<h2>So&#8230;What is the Shame Spiral, Exactly?</h2>
<p>When you feel ashamed like this, do you ever feel like you&#8217;re unable to fully be present in the situation you&#8217;re in? Do you have trouble looking others in the eyes, thinking about what a terrible person you are?</p>
<p>These are common reactions to shame. People mired in shame spirals tend to isolate, cutting themselves off from the support of family and friends. Ironically, this prevents them from feeling better, and keeps them mired in shame.</p>
<p>In worst case scenarios, this type of shame can lead to a depressive or even suicidal episode. Shame certainly triggers unhealthy eating behaviors among those who tend toward <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/06/eating-disorders-story-awareness/" target="_blank">eating disordered behavior</a>. A binge episode is often caused by shame, as is any self-punishing behavior, like a period of restricting food. Cutting or other self-harm is also often triggered by a feeling of overwhelming shame.</p>
<p>Anxiety or PTSD worsens because of shame. In fact, there is no mental or emotional issue that is not exacerbated by shame.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/07/why-do-highly-sensitive-people-engage-in-routines/" target="_blank">Sensitive people are more susceptible</a> to shame spirals than others. Since they feel things so deeply, their shame can feel more severe and life-altering. People who tend toward depression and anxiety are also more deeply affected by shame, as they find themselves ruminating over perceived mistakes or reprimands, turning it over and over in their minds, and feel more responsible for their &#8220;wrongdoings&#8221; as a result. People who were raised by parents who use shame as a disciplinary tactic as also much more deeply wounded by shame as adults.</p>
<h2>How to Deal with the Shame Spiral</h2>
<p>In order to extricate yourself from a shame spiral, it is essential to do the thing that you least want to do: think openly about what happened.</p>
<p><strong>1. Don&#8217;t ignore what happened.</strong></p>
<p>When you feel shame, the natural tendency is to bury the shameful episode, remark, or interaction deep in your subconscious. Yet, as you know if you’ve ever experienced debilitating shame, this never works. The shame keeps coming back and preventing you from fully engaging in your life.</p>
<p>However, if you think, talk, or write about whatever it is that made you feel ashamed, you will notice something surprising. After the first few minutes of talking about it, or even the first few seconds, you start to feel much less ashamed. It&#8217;s just true!</p>
<p><strong>2. In the midst of shame, try to trust that shame will dissipate.</strong></p>
<p>This happens all the time in therapy, and it&#8217;s magical to see. A client can come in with something that feels shameful and awful, and if they finally get over the hump of not being able to mention it out loud or in writing, their shame decreases steadily over time. Speaking about a shameful thing to a kind, objective person, whether a therapist or a friend, can almost immediately give you some distance and objectivity yourself.</p>
<p>For some clients who feel shame recurrently on different occasions, their trust in the ability to let go of shame gets better with time. It&#8217;s all about approaching it with an attitude of experimentation.</p>
<p><strong>3. Write it out.</strong></p>
<p>If you can’t or won’t discuss your shame with an outsider, even a kind therapist, then writing, or even thinking openly about your shame, can be of almost equal utility. Writing is a way to get some healthy distance from your negative thought patterns, and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/finding-inner-peace-mindfulness-5-senses/" target="_blank">practice mindfulness in a simple way</a>. Put simply, putting your experience down in words helps you stay more present with the reality of whatever your situation is.</p>
<p>For instance, you would force yourself to write a few paragraphs about how you feel about <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/12/mental-health-in-bed-cheating-and-forgiveness/" target="_blank">your partner cheating on you</a>, or your coworker pointing out that you gained weight, or your horrible blunder at work. It is almost guaranteed that after 20 minutes of writing, you will be able to move back and see this mistake or episode more objectively, recognizing that while it feels awful and unbearable right now, it may not feel that way tomorrow, and almost definitely will not in a week, month, or year.</p>
<p>If you find yourself trapped in a shame spiral, don’t let it sabotage your mental and emotional health. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/unlimited-messaging-therapy/" target="_blank">Reach out to a therapist</a>, friend, family member, or even an online forum, and unburden yourself by sharing your thoughts with them. Shame thrives in secrecy, and often can’t survive in the open.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inside every human being is a desire to pursue wild ambitions and discover new possibilities. There’s a would-be entrepreneur, motivational speaker, freelance writer, stage performer, or off-the-grid traveler in all of us.</p>
<p>But unfortunately most people spend their lives in a routine, nondescript comfort zone because they’re too intimidated to chase a goal that seems uncertain and prone to fail. According to a 2016 survey, an estimated <a href="https://www.couponbox.com/us/press/fighting-fear-the-7-billion-dollar-price-tag/" target="_blank">34.2 million Americans</a> experience some type of phobia. The most common is a fear of personal failure, which most of us define broadly as unemployment, financial ruin, and isolation from others.</p>
<p>Also called “atychiphobia,” this fear of failure often becomes so debilitating it can hinder a person from attempting any goal that is not a guaranteed success. It feels safe and secure, but functioning in this state of rigidity will hold you back from opportunities, experiences and overall happiness.</p>
<p>Here are five potential indicators that a fear of failure has come between you and the life of purpose, excitement, or satisfaction you dream about.<span id="more-6618"></span></p>
<h2>You Procrastinate or Avoid Responsibility</h2>
<p>Did you know there’s a direct correlation between the fear of failure and a person’s ability to manage assignments within the time allotted? According to Adam McCaffrey, a researcher whose work was discussed in <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dont-delay/200902/fear-failure" target="_blank">Psychology Today</a>, those who panic at the idea of failing exhibit a lower sense of self-determination that often causes a lack of motivation to finish deadline-driven projects. It squelches the confidence to take on major responsibilities. If you feel immobilized to perform tasks out of concern that you won’t succeed, this fear of failure can inhibit your productivity.</p>
<h2>You Feel Discontent in Your Career Path</h2>
<p>At some point in your career, you’ll feel disengaged and antsy; ready for something new, but not paralyzed without knowing where your next step should be. Author and entrepreneur, Daniel Gulati, <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/01/why-you-wont-quit-your-job" target="_blank">reported</a> that job dissatisfaction rates are well above 80 percent, but that most people are unlikely to quit a current profession and seek out their real passion instead. He ascribes this trend to a behavior known as “risk-aversion.”</p>
<p>This theory of risk aversion suggests individuals are conditioned to choose safety and familiarity over ambiguity and unpredictability, often to the detriment of their own happiness. If you allow extreme caution to keep you stuck in a mediocre or creatively stifling position, this fear of failure can stagnate your career growth.</p>
<h2>You Worry About Disappointing Others</h2>
<p>Prolific keynote speaker Mike Robbins points out in a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-robbins/disappointment_b_1354461.html" target="_blank">HuffPost article</a> that the effort to avoid disappointing people can negatively impact the outcome of a decision or paralyze someone from making any decision in the first place. Those who define failure in terms of letting others down ignore their own aspirations because they’re too focused on cooperating with the opinions of everyone else.</p>
<p>Robbins argues that too much emphasis on outside voices will deter a person from experiencing fulfillment and authenticity. If you avoid disappointment, this fear of failure can harm both your relationships and self-awareness.</p>
<h2>You Experience Physical Effects of Stress</h2>
<p>When people spend all of their energy fixating on the possibility of defeat, they risk suffering both physically and mentally. Our bodies manifest stress and anxiety in a wide <a href="http://www.fearof.net/fear-of-failure-phobia-atychiphobia/" target="_blank">variety of ways</a>, including <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/anxiety-attack-vs-panic-attack-one/" target="_blank">panic attacks</a>, headaches, sweating, muscle spasms, insomnia, and gastrointestinal distress.</p>
<p>An outward sign of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/how-to-get-rid-of-anxiety-separating-good-bad/" target="_blank">anxiety</a> should not be disregarded, but rather, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/7-self-care-tips-for-when-stress-affects-your-body/" target="_blank">taken care of</a> before it escalates into a more serious condition. If you have extreme reactions to stress, this fear of failure can jeopardize your health over time.</p>
<h2>You Aren’t Proactive About Your Future</h2>
<p>In an <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stan-popovich/how-to-overcome-the-fear-_1_b_7886360.html" target="_blank">article for HuffPo</a>, Stan Popovich, author of A Layman’s Guide to Managing Fear, discusses that people tend to overanalyze future events because they’re unable to predict what might happen. This pattern leads to feeling powerless.</p>
<p>Without immediate assurance and instant gratification, the unknown becomes a source of distress for many individuals. If you sidestep thoughts, plans or conversations about the future, this fear of failure can sabotage both your current goals and future prospects or opportunities.</p>
<p>Before you can overcome a phobia, it’s crucial to understand the reason it exists in the first place. Consider working with a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a> to uncover the causes of your anxieties regarding failure. Once you commit to taking risks that are important to you, you’ll discover a stronger, bolder, and happier version of yourself.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Self-awareness is an extremely pivotal trait to possess in life, and way too often we overlook its value. When you become self-aware, you become conscious of your problems and emotions. And the sooner you are aware of those, the sooner you can work toward fixing them.<span id="more-3753"></span></p>
<p>Being self-aware forces you to slow down and observe yourself, like an outsider. We get so caught up in our actions, thoughts, opinions and feelings that we forget to make sense of it all. We forget to take a step back, to dig a little deeper into who we are. We forget to ask ourselves important questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why did I react that way?</li>
<li>Why does that specific thing bother me so much?</li>
<li>Why haven’t I gotten over that <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/09/the-post-breakup-guide-to-dealing-with-social-media-and-your-ex/" target="_blank">breakup</a> yet?</li>
<li>Instead of accepting every little thing that goes through our mind, why don’t we ask ourselves about it a little more?</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there’s a fine line between good mindfulness and bad. Being hyper-conscious of yourself, your actions and how others perceive you has a familiar name: anxiety.</p>
<p>You don’t want to be anxious, insecure and overly critical of yourself in a desperate attempt to be self-aware. Allow yourself to have a clear and tolerant understanding of who you are.</p>
<p>A good form of self-awareness shouldn’t be damaging. It should be healing, enlightening, uplifting. Self-awareness is not obsessive and harmful overthinking. It is being able to recognize an aspect of your being and use that information in a beneficial way.</p>
<h2>Self-Awareness Helped Me Become Less Fearful</h2>
<p>When you are cognizant of who you are, you have an easier time coming to conclusions and making vital connections and discoveries. I am an extremely fearful person, and not only about real threats. I fear zombies and monsters and paranormal entities, all things I know don’t exist.</p>
<p>This was a reality I accepted for a long time because I didn’t take a moment to become curious about it. And that’s where self-awareness sparks from: curiosity about who we are.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until I went to therapy that I thought to actually question why I’m that way instead of accepting it. Self-awareness was the first step toward my cure. When I became paralyzed with fear, unable to step outside my bathroom door in fear of what was lurking on the other side — instead of succumbing to it — I stopped and pondered:</p>
<p>Why the hell am I so scared? What is it I’m scared of? I know those things don’t exist, so why are they still making my heart race? Do I not feel safe for some reason? Am I taking one issue of my life and allowing fear to be its vehicle?</p>
<p>When I became curious about my fear, that’s when it would dwindle. That’s when I would feel like I had a handle on my issues.</p>
<h2>Therapy Is the Quickest Path to Self-Awareness</h2>
<p>Because of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/therapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a>, I understand myself much better than before. I understand how my mind works, where my emotions come from, why I’ll act on certain things and not others. By knowing who I am, it makes it easier to heal, to learn lessons.</p>
<p>For the longest time I thought my fear was unreasonable, silly, arbitrary. But once I knew myself better, I discovered it wasn’t any of those things. It was the opposite: There was an understandable reason why certain things frightened me. And the more you understand about yourself, the more you understand about other people; the more you can sympathize and empathize; the more insight you gain into problems and their solutions.</p>
<p>With mental illness, being mindful can be especially hard. You might suffer from <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a> but feel frustrated because you can’t wrap your head around why you have depression. You put blame on things, find scapegoats, make excuses without knowing what’s going on in your head.</p>
<p>Having a mental illness can sometimes feel like a phantom making decisions for you. You know you have to get out of bed and go to work, but some mornings your depression makes you feel like you physically can’t. Your nagging anxiety about work can keep you from enjoying yourself and relaxing when you get home each evening.</p>
<p>You don’t want these things to affect your daily life, but they do. They have an invisible yet powerful hold over you.</p>
<p>But you can come to understand these things and feel as though you actually wield some power over it. By understanding who you are and how your mind works, you become the powerful one, not your illness.</p>
<p>Therapy can help you get to that point, and will keep you on the right path. Therapists are your coaches, making sure you exercise your mindfulness regularly and appropriately. They will hold your hand while you explore your emotions and actions, your past and present, all while getting to know yourself. And getting to fully know who you are is a beautiful, cathartic thing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The words “judge” and “judgment” have negative connotations and tend to place people in a no-win situation. You don’t want to be judged, yet you want to be able to tell if someone is judging you. Even when we know discovering the truth might hurt, curiosity wins.</p>
<p>Judgment, however, is not necessarily something to worry about. There are positive, neutral and negative forms of it. Whether it’s <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/">therapy</a> or an actual courtroom, the key is understanding which one you are dealing with and learning how to respond.<span id="more-3568"></span></p>
<h2>Defining Judgment: The Good, The Bad and The Meaningless</h2>
<p>When you cross the street, you look both ways and decide whether to continue walking. That’s a judgment.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re judging others, or feeling judged, at its core, a judgment is an opinion or decision based on thoughts, feelings and evidence. We make hundreds of them every day.</p>
<p>“Within the first seven seconds of meeting someone, our brain makes 11 different decisions about them including their intelligence, socioeconomic status, education, competence and trustworthiness,” said corporate image consultant and personal brand strategist <a href="http://www.stylecounselatl.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Anna Hinson</a>.</p>
<p>This is a subconscious process people cannot control. You most likely won’t be able to detect many signs during these seven seconds.</p>
<p>There are positive judgments, too. If you saw someone give food to a homeless person, you would instinctively make a positive judgment about his or her character. Judging only becomes a problem when we make unnecessary, hurtful or unfair judgments based on little evidence.</p>
<h2>Things That Make People Feel Like They Are Being Judged Negatively</h2>
<p>When people make you question your character, intelligence, beliefs, decisions or preferences in a way that causes shame, they can make you feel judged in a negative way. They might not intend it, but the feeling of judgment is still hurtful. Looking out for these common situations will protect you. Judging someone else creates the same feelings in others.</p>
<h3>Tons of Advice and No Empathy</h3>
<p>Receiving far more advice than empathy makes people feel judged, said <a href="http://giantstepscoaching.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">therapist Bradley Foster</a>.</p>
<p>People often believe talking about what you are doing wrong and how they would handle the situation differently is helpful. In reality, it makes you feel inferior. It’s better to begin with acknowledging the person’s struggles and conclude with concise advice that doesn’t involve “I would have done it this way.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.birminghammaple.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Therapist Carrie Krawiec</a> suggests people watch out for an excess of “should” language as well.</p>
<p>Most people think they know the right way to do things, Krawiec said, but they don’t consider factors unique to the individual.</p>
<p>With an attitude like that, it’s easy to drop “should” a dozen times before offering any empathy.</p>
<h3>Their Opinion is Different</h3>
<p>Sometimes a simple difference in opinion can make people feel judged. Maybe the person talked about their opinion in way that made yours seem silly by comparison. Feeling judged is rarely an enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>People often do not have an objective sense of what judgment is, said <a href="http://losangeleswestsidetherapy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">therapist Jeanette Raymond</a>. This is especially true when dealing with people they are emotionally attached to.</p>
<p>“Client&#8217;s often mistake a lack of acceptance as &#8216;judgment,&#8217;” Raymond said.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember people are capable of disagreeing without disrespecting. Someone can express their opinion without belittling yours.</p>
<h3>When People Are, Without a Doubt, Judging You</h3>
<p>There’s a big difference between accidentally judging someone and going out of the way to judge. People use the latter to deliberately make others feel shame.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of things people might say when doing this:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re going to have another doughnut? Really?</li>
<li>It sounds like you didn’t try hard enough.</li>
<li>You’re going out in that.</li>
</ul>
<p>And then there are the visual cues or actions to look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>the “head to toe” glance followed by a glare or frown</li>
<li>seeming uncomfortable and wanting to leave</li>
<li>a sigh or groan in response to something you’ve done</li>
</ul>
<p>There are hundreds of these visual cues, but you will not pick up on most of them. They occur too quickly or outside of your periphery.</p>
<p>Before you start looking for them, think about whether they matter. Do you feel like what you’re doing is wrong? That question is usually more important than what other people think.</p>
<h2>Judgment in Therapy: The Big Worry for Prospective Clients</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Therapy</a> is one of the most common environments where people are terrified of being judged negatively. It’s natural to worry when you’re revealing your fears, trauma and secrets.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/08/the-different-types-of-therapists-and-counselors-the-complete-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">therapists</a> are trained to refrain from judging clients in a way that is not productive or unnecessarily hurtful.</p>
<p>Therapist and professor <a href="https://twitter.com/Nikki13green" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Nikki Martinez</a> teaches courses where she helps therapists in training learn to manage their instinct to judge (they are human, after all).</p>
<p>Therapists cannot be effective until they own their biases and prejudices, Martinez told Talkspace, but this should not change the experience of therapy.</p>
<p>“I break the ice by using humor, normalizing, and letting them know there is nothing they can say to me that will change my opinion of them,” Martinez said.</p>
<p>When these efforts fail and clients are feeling judged, Martinez recommended they take one of three options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let the therapist know you feel he or she has judged you in a negative way. Try to work through it and come to an understanding if you like your therapist and want to continue.</li>
<li>Find a new therapist by asking for a referral or doing the research yourself.</li>
<li>In extreme situations, you can file an ethics complaint.</li>
</ol>
<p>As humans, we are guilty of judging others and sometimes ourselves. Therapists are no exception, but a good therapist will keep their thoughts of judgment from interfering with making progress.</p>
<h3>Redefining Judgment in Therapy and the Benefits of Forms of Negative Judgment</h3>
<p>Like judgment outside of therapy, judgment in the context of therapy is not innately negative. Depending on the definition, it is necessary and crucial for the patient to make progress.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.drhokemeyer.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Therapist Paul Hokemeyer</a> defines judgment as an “educated decision that leads to a reparative outcome” for the client. A diagnosis is a form of judgment, and diagnosis is necessary for the therapist and client to make progress.</p>
<p>Therapists need to judge themselves too, although not in the way you might think.</p>
<p>“In other words, I need to judge how I feel in their presence,” Hokemeyer told Talkspace. “Am I excited and overstimulated? This is evidence the patient is suffering from mania or anxiety,” he said, offering an example of judging his feelings to work towards a diagnosis.</p>
<p>Then there are times when judgments that might temporarily make the client feel bad are actually furthering progress.</p>
<p>“The goal of psychotherapy is not to coddle patients but rather to challenge them to become better, higher functioning human beings,” Hokemeyer said. “The purpose of moving them towards discomfort, however, is not to make them feel bad but rather to guide them into new experiences and insights.”</p>
<p>Discomfort, however, is different than shame. Any judgment that makes clients feel shame has no place in therapy. And any judgment outside of therapy that makes you feel shame is something you should confront or talk about.</p>
<h2>Dealing with Judgment: What to Do After the Verdict Comes In</h2>
<p>Even the harshest forms of judgment do not have to cripple you. The therapists we spoke to had several recommendations on how to respond to negative judgment.</p>
<h3>Ask Them to Spell It Out</h3>
<p>When judging others in a hurtful way, it’s usually indirect. Maybe it’s some backhanded comment or expression they think you don’t see. They don’t actually tell you they’re judging you.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to take your self-esteem back is to confront them by asking whether they intended to judge you. If they didn’t intend to judge, you can resolve it and let them know it still hurt you.</p>
<p>If they admit to judging, you can ask why they need to do that. This puts them in a position where they have to question these negative behaviors and reduces the chance they will judge others again.</p>
<h3>Own It!</h3>
<p>When people judge you in a hurtful way, they threaten your identity. The key is being open to helpful feedback while believing there is nothing fundamentally wrong with you.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Own your identity and don&#8217;t let someone else define what is acceptable.” &#8211; <a href="http://www.kristenleecosta.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Kristen Lee Costa</a>, Therapist, Author and Speaker</p></blockquote>
<h3>Accept the Judgment and Move On</h3>
<p>When people worry about judgment, they often make the mistake of believing they can prevent it from happening. Maybe they can reduce the chance of judgment to zero by dressing conservatively and staying quiet.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t work because human nature is to judge, <a href="http://www.fashionpsychologyinstitute.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">fashion psychologist Dawnn Karen</a> told Talkspace. Here&#8217;s the attitude she recommends:</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be judged. What can I do about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>If you keep the wisdom from these experts in mind, knowing when someone is judging you — positively or negatively — will become an opportunity to grow stronger and fortify your mental health. That’s the only judgment we have.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paul hated the holidays. It wasn’t only keeping up with appearances. Paul couldn’t keep up with his mind and feelings.</p>
<p>When our minds are racing, we get angry and scared and try to rescue ourselves by “snapping out of it.” But what if doing that shoves us on to the treadmill of our thoughts and emotions?</p>
<p>If you feel like you can’t keep up, how about taking a little time to give thanks. Gratitude actually takes us to a place of safety. Too often, we give thanks for other people and what we have. Perhaps this year, we could cultivate gratitude for ourselves. Here are some questions to reflect on.<span id="more-3295"></span></p>
<h2>What changes have I made this year that I’m thankful for?</h2>
<p>If you think you haven’t made any changes or are too stuck to change, think again. We are always evolving —  right down to every cell in our body. Think about what changes you’ve made towards becoming a better version of yourself this year. The fact that you’re here reading about wellbeing is a stride. After all, many of us go through our lives with little awareness of mental health.</p>
<h2>Can I see my negative emotions in a different way?</h2>
<p>Depression, Anxiety &amp; Company. Negative emotions have a bad reputation. We pretend they don’t exist at times, but at other times we’re swept away by them. What if I told you  negative emotions exist for a reason. Evolutionarily, depression signals when to retreat so we can conserve our resources and recharge. Anxiety protects us by preparing us to fight, run away or plan to solve a problem. <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/negative-emotions-key-well-being" target="_blank">They are fundamentally useful</a>. But when things get difficult in our lives — because something bad has happened or we’ve done something we’re not proud of — these negative emotions morph into Depression, Anxiety &amp; Company-On-Steroids. They worsen when we fight them, so we feel trapped in quicksand. What can we do instead? Thank our negative emotions for trying to protect us, and give ourselves permission to feel them. We are human after all.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-3318 alignleft" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/quote-1-Perpetua_275_JR.jpg" alt="Perpetua Neo quote 1 thanksgiving" width="183" height="275" />I like what Zen monk and meditation teacher<strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPVr6w_P67c" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thich Nhat Hanh </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">advises: cradle our emotions and take care of them. That way, we learn to understand where they come from and how to help ourselves. When we face our fears squarely, we grow as people.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What painful lessons am I now thankful for?</h2>
<p>To be alive is to taste the full spectrum of emotions and experiences. We cannot select what’s good and avoid the bad. Rather, it’s about knowing that when bad things happen, we’ll be able to overcome them. They say hindsight is 20/20; sometimes our best friend is Cognitive Photoshop. When the pain has bubbled over and we’ve rebuilt our lives, we can see things in a different perspective. And when we reflect on the painful lessons we’ve grown to be thankful for, we become more resilient and better able to overcome — because life will always happen.</p>
<h2>What have I shed that I’m grateful for?</h2>
<p>As we grow, we lose things that no longer serve us. These can be habits, beliefs and emotions. Sometimes they’re physical, things like excess weight, illness and pain. Often, we’re so caught up in what we lack and what we haven’t yet gained that we forget what we’ve released.</p>
<h2>Do I hold myself to harder standards than I treat others?</h2>
<p>We’re often harshest to ourselves. When I ask my clients how they would treat their friends or their children in the same scenario, with wide eyes they declare “Of course not!” Yet, we’re uncompromisingly difficult with ourselves. We can give thanks by treating ourselves kindly, by allowing ourselves to be vulnerable and feel, just like every other human being. Who do I love and protect? Can I love and protect myself in the same way from now on?</p>
<p>If you’ve answered “yes” to the previous question, this reflection can help you practice giving love to yourself. Think about how you respond kindly and with care to anyone —  your child, cat or friend. Connect to that place inside you where the love and safety comes from. And when you notice you’re being harsh to yourself, tell yourself “I deserve to treat me kindly.” Breathe gently into yourself as you connect into the place of love and safety.</p>
<h2>Are the good things I do really “stupid” or “irrational”?</h2>
<p>Too often, we dismiss the things we do as “stupid”, “little” or “irrational”. I know, society teaches us to be bigger, stronger and faster than our competitors. It’s always about newer and shinier toys. That’s where we learn to put a metric on what we do.<a href="http://www.elephantjournal.com/2015/10/chopping-off-that-invisible-yardstick-the-one-mindset-change-we-need/" target="_blank"> How about seeing it this way– a good thing is a good thing.</a> Let’s not give it a size. Instead, can we be thankful for these things we are able to do? If you treated yourself kindly today or if you didn’t label your kind action as “small” or “stupid”, give thanks for that.</p>
<h2>What do I love about myself?</h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-3320 alignleft" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/quote-2-perpetua_275H_JR.jpg" alt="joy quote thanking yourself" width="183" height="275" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As a <a href="http://www.perpetuaneo.com" target="_blank">psychologist and coach</a>, I believe we’re all worthy. We just need to remember that. Sometimes, stepping back and reflecting on what we love about ourselves can help us to reconnect with our sense of worth without worrying about society’s values or obsessing over what we lack. What do you like when you look in the mirror? What about your personality do you love? What talents and abilities are you grateful for. What have you achieved that you’re most proud of? If you were to choose the one thing about yourself that brings you great joy, what would it be?</p>
<h2>How can I create joy in my life?</h2>
<p>My favorite meditation is smiling meditation. Smiling is a quick hack that sends our brains signals to feel peaceful and safe. As you breathe, feel yourself giving a relaxed smile. Widen your smile until you feel it connect with a place inside where you feel calm and warm. Shift your attention to your eyes, basking in the feeling of warmth. Allow your eyes to smile. And as you continue to breathe in and out, connect with a sense of your whole body smiling.</p>
<p><strong>How will you practice gratitude for yourself today? </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The truth is self-esteem is made up; it’s a construction.</h2>
<p><em>&#8211; by Ken Fields, MA, LMHC / Talkspace Therapist</em></p>
<p>Unlike a part of our bodies or something in the natural environment, our belief in ourselves is not a real thing &#8211; it has no objective existence of its own. We can all agree on a person&#8217;s height, weight, or even on how fast he or she can walk a mile. But, there is no standardized way for us to objectively measure self-esteem.<em><span id="more-1227"></span></em></p>
<p>We may think that a person with a successful career, who seems to be productive and wealthy, also has &#8220;high&#8221; self-esteem. But that may not be the case at all. Think about it, those who strive for superiority can be attempting to overcome deep-seated feelings of inferiority. And it’s very possible that their success is a way of compensating for their &#8220;low&#8221; self-esteem.</p>
<p>Here’s another example: Imagine a student who gets straight A&#8217;s year after year. Do you think the student’s achievements reflect his or her high self-esteem? Or do they indicate the student’s fear of punishment for not living up to a particular standard? Similarly, can the student’s grades be indicators of his or her competitiveness?</p>
<p>Self-esteem is internal and cannot be gauged by the external factors in our lives. To really understand this, try to envision a financially struggling mother of five children who is happy, patient, giving, and relatively unburdened by the evident stressors in her environment. What do you think her self-esteem is like, especially based solely on this information?</p>
<p>Self-esteem can be determined, in part, by how we interact with and respond to the situations and circumstances of our lives. Generally, we can say that people with high self-esteem are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding and supportive</strong></li>
<li><strong>Independent and cooperative</strong></li>
<li><strong>Eager to learn new information</strong></li>
<li><strong>Able to change their beliefs and behaviors based on new information</strong></li>
<li><strong>Trusting of their capabilities</strong></li>
<li><strong>Problem solvers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Able to set healthy boundaries and dabble in constructive assertiveness</strong></li>
<li><strong>Have a positive attitude</strong></li>
<li><strong>Have an internal locus of control</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>People with low self-esteem can generally be characterized as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overbearing and demanding</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dependent and selfish</strong></li>
<li><strong>Afraid of risk and challenges</strong></li>
<li><strong>Resistant to change and growth</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mistrusting of their capabilities</strong></li>
<li><strong>Comfortable blaming others for their problems</strong></li>
<li><strong>Easily manipulated</strong></li>
<li><strong>Possessing a negative attitude</strong></li>
<li><strong>Having an external locus of control</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The higher the self-esteem, the less a person needs to seek out validation from others. That&#8217;s because people who know their value and self-worth realize that it can only really come from them. Allowing their self-esteem to be influenced by other people takes away a lot of their power, making them easy to manipulate.</p>
<p>Individuals with low self-esteem believe they can &#8220;win&#8221; someone’s approval, thereby establishing their self-worth. But, even if this tactic proves to be successful, the rewards never last for very long; those who give their approval and validation can easily take it away. This can further weaken a person’s sense of personal power and control over his or her life, which can then yield resentments, frustrations, anger, depression, pessimism, and a negative attitude in general.</p>
<p>In his classic <em><a title="Paradise Lost" href="http://www.amazon.com/Paradise-Lost-Dover-Thrift-Editions/dp/048644287X" target="_blank">Paradise Lost</a>, </em>English poet John Milton stated ,&#8221;The Mind is its own place and can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.&#8221; Which will you choose?</p>
<p>We are not born with high or low self-esteem, but we can decide to find value and meaning in our lives, regardless of our circumstances; we can choose to be kind, loving, and understanding towards others and ourselves. And we can most certainly choose to change in any way we see fit.</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s our ability to make choices and decide on a course of action that gives us power, and that power makes us free from the opinions of other people, in-effect elevating our self-esteem.</h3>
