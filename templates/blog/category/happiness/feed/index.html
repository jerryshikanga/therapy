				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Science knows the secret to happiness — and it’s a lot more simple than you’d think.</p>
<p>That, at least, was the message of a recent <i>New York </i>article that summarized the scientific consensus on what makes humans happy. And, well: turns out that you could probably guess the answers. Beyond having your basic needs met, money, as your mom probably could have told you, does not buy happiness — though it can buy free time to do what you want, which does make you happier. Gratitude is good. Social connection is important. Doing things for others makes us feel better about ourselves.</p>
<p>This is all well and good for the long term. Sure, we all plan to incorporate more family time into our days, take up a hobby, and give back. But when you’re having a crappy day, it’s not enough to plan for the future — you want to know how can the research on happiness can make your day better <i>now</i>.</p>
<p><span id="more-10574"></span></p>
<p>You’re in luck. Here are five ways you can turn your day around right now. That’s right: we mean <i>right now</i>.</p>
<h2>1) Breathe</h2>
<p>We get it: you’re busy. So busy, in fact, that while it may be great to go to the spa, go for a run, or even take a twenty-minute snooze, you hardly have time to run to the bathroom. But there is still one thing you can do to bring some calming vibes into a busy day: <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/03/how-you-can-beat-anxiety-with-mindful-breathing/" target="_blank">breathe</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/relaxation-techniques-breath-control-helps-quell-errant-stress-response" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Harvard Medical School</a> recommends a simple exercise to practice deep breathing. Sitting or lying down, simply practice breathing from — as any high school music teacher will tell you — the diaphragm. Allow your lower belly and chest to rise as you fill your lungs with air. If you’re breathing deeply, your stomach will expand outwards. You can practice this for a few minutes right now, closing your eyes and breathing deeply to feel more relaxed and refreshed.</p>
<p>C’mon — you definitely have time to <i>breathe</i>. You’re doing it anyway!</p>
<h2>2) Do something nice</h2>
<p>Nice guys do, in fact, finish last — because the mean guys die early. That’s right: research has found that <a href="http://time.com/4618363/longevity-care-grandparents-research/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">caring for others</a> actually helps people live longer. Acts of kindness can also <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/emotional-nourishment/201711/why-random-acts-kindness-matter-your-wellbeing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">improve our happiness</a> in the short term, giving what’s called a “helper’s high.”</p>
<p>So if your day is less than stellar, take a few minutes to help number one by helping someone else. Your random act of kindness could be tiny, like stopping to chat with a neighbor, making sure to leave your spouse a full tank of gas, or even (yup, we said it) calling your mother (we know you miss her too).</p>
<h2>3) Practice gratitude</h2>
<p>If you’ve ever sat at a Thanksgiving table as you go around and say what you’re each grateful for out loud, you may have felt a bit, well, awkward. But we bet you also developed a serious case of the warm and fuzzies as you realized how much there really is to be grateful for in life.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Science backs this intuition up</a>. Research has consistently found that practicing <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/11/dont-forget-to-thank-the-most-important-person-in-your-life-you/" target="_blank">gratitude</a> makes us happier and healthier. In one study, participants who wrote a sentence about what they were grateful for each day not only reported increased happiness than participants who wrote about their annoyances — they also exercised more and reported fewer visits to the doctor.</p>
<p>Turn your day around by taking a few minutes to list what you’re grateful for today. Whether it’s your health, your family, your dog, or the easy commute to work this morning, let it out. Even better? Write a thank-you or appreciation note to someone in your life, and send or deliver it in person today. While the purists would argue this should be handwritten, in a pinch we think a Facebook message works just fine.</p>
<p><a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/online-therapy-with-a-licensed-therapist?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_MID&amp;utr_adgroup=midpost-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=10574&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/5-ways-turn-day-around-now/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4880 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png" alt="affordable blog purchase CTA" width="660" height="240" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png 660w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a></p>
<h2>4) Turn off your phone</h2>
<p>You know the lingering exhaustion that lurks after yet another insomniac evening scrolling through feeds of your friends’ fabulous lives? Turns out that malaise isn’t just in your head: too much screen time really can make us depressed, <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320699.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">according to recent research</a> about teenagers’ smartphone use.</p>
<p>From the expectation of constant availability to stress about current events and self-comparison (<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/ritual-and-the-brain/201804/the-science-fomo-and-what-we-re-really-missing-out" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FOMO is real</a>), being plugged in can be exhausting. While the dream would be to unplug for the day — or heck, even the whole weekend — that may not be realistic, at least in daily life.</p>
<p>But we <i>can </i>choose to cultivate better phone habits overall. For example, we can turn our phones off to sleep, turn on “do not disturb” mode or keep them away from the bed. We can actually turn them off in the movies or at public events, and not just pretend to silence them. We can have a strict no-phones rule when having conversations or eating dinner with other people. And we can, for the love of all that is holy, quit bringing the phone with us into the bathroom. There are some things that just don’t have to go into your Snapchat story.</p>
<p>Want to boost your day now? Try leaving the phone behind and going for a simple walk around the block. Notice things: how do the trees look? Any nice smells coming from the bakery? At an even smaller scale, try <i>not </i>reaching for your phone when you have a minute of downtime, in an elevator or waiting in line, for example. Take that time, instead, to be present in your environment (and hey, why not try a moment of gratitude?). The real world, it turns out, is pretty interesting, too.</p>
<h2>5) Go the eff to sleep</h2>
<p>In the classic book <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-mystery-of-go-the-f-to-sleep-solved" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Go the F**ck to Sleep</i></a><i>, </i>that particular command is directed at children. But it’s pretty good advice all around. Not getting enough sleep turns humans into cranky, miserable seamonsters. It’s not just your partner telling you this because they find it unbearable to be around you when you’re tired (guilty): <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/sleep-and-tiredness/why-lack-of-sleep-is-bad-for-your-health/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">science agrees, too</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/the-surprising-new-connection-between-sleep-and-mental-health/" target="_blank">Lack of sleep</a> can lower your cognitive abilities, make you a terrible driver, lessen your immunity, have an all-around negative effect on your mental health, and to conclude, make you feel generally miserable. <a href="https://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20459221,00.html#lower-stress-0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Getting enough sleep</a>, on the other hand, improves your memory, sharpens your attention, improves your metabolism, and makes you feel a whole lot better about life.</p>
<p>These benefits count for naps, too. A <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/napping/art-20048319" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">daytime nap</a> can help you relax, improve your mood, and improve your cognition.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? A crappy day is the perfect invitation to take a nap. Aim for twenty to thirty minutes around mid-afternoon for maximum benefits. And if if it’s already night and you’re doing work that really can wait until tomorrow, what are you waiting for? Hit the hay now, and we promise, tomorrow will be much better.</p>
<p>And hey, if you find time for a little “roll in the hay” before you hit it, <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/02/why-sex-makes-people-happy.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">so much the better</a> for your happiness.</p>
<h2>Happiness Starts Now</h2>
<p>Happiness may seem like a big picture thing, but in reality, it’s all in the details. We all tell ourselves that we’ll be happy “when…” When we get that promotion. When we find the perfect partner. When we have a baby. When we buy a house.</p>
<p>The truth is, that “when” never comes. Even <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/winning-powerball-lottery-happiness-2017-8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">lottery winners</a>, as it turns out, aren’t all that much happier than the rest of us average shmoes. So while turning today around may seem like small fish compared to a lifetime of happiness, in reality, making small changes now is the best way you can cultivate real joy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is widely understood that what happens inside your brain influences what happens to your body, and consciously cultivating a positive outlook on life is no different. Looking on the bright side isn’t always easy, but there are some practical reasons why you should (and can) adopt an optimistic perspective.</p>
<p><span id="more-9735"></span></p>
<h2>Benefits of Being Optimistic</h2>
<p>When you have a positive mindset on what’s ahead, it is easier to feel more enjoyment in the present, and you will probably <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17165632?dopt=Abstract" target="_blank">live longer with far fewer health problems</a>. Research also shows <a href="https://www.dovepress.com/randomized-controlled-trial-of-a-positive-affect-intervention-to-reduc-peer-reviewed-article-OAJCT" target="_blank">a strong link between optimism and positive health benefits</a>, such as better weight control, healthier blood sugar levels, and a decreased chance for heart disease. That same study, conducted by Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, also suggests positivity can play “an important role in adaptation to chronic illness.”</p>
<p>Although the benefits are striking, it isn’t always easy to be positive. In fact, some may feel it is far easier to think of worst-case scenarios while finding faults and imperfections in everything. But what if you could turn your thinking around in just one day? According to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21450262" target="_blank">one study</a>, conducting a five-minute-long thought exercise each day — where you positively visualize your future self — can significantly increase optimism after both one day and two full weeks of practice. It might be just that simple.</p>
<p>There are other simple ways to train yourself to become more positive, with the goal of feeling more happy, content and calm each day — no matter what may be happening in your personal or professional life.</p>
<h2>1. Recognize and Reflect on a Positive Event Each Day</h2>
<p>This can take the form of a simple mental acknowledgement, a journal entry, or can even be brought up during a conversation among friends. Once this act becomes more comfortable, a daily gratitude journal is also a great way to promote consistently positive thinking.</p>
<h2>2. Identify a Personal Strength</h2>
<p>Rather than focusing on all the ways you may be falling short, or where you’ve went wrong over the course of a day, try recalibrating to notice your unique personal strengths and how you use them. Maybe it’s a hidden talent, area of expertise, or special personality trait.</p>
<h2>3. Set an Attainable Goal and Note Your Progress</h2>
<p>Nothing can send a person into a negative tailspin quite like falling short of a goal. To start feeling more confident and happy, set attainable goals (<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/how-setting-micro-goals-can-increase-happiness/" target="_blank">such as a micro-goal</a>) that you can achieve, celebrating each small increment of progress along the way</p>
<h2>4. Reframe Stressful Situations into Opportunities to be Positive.</h2>
<p>Perhaps you have heard the saying, “when one door closes a window opens.” It’s simple, but reappraising an event in a positive light can be an easy way to remember to find the silver lining in difficult situations. Maybe you missed your exit, for instance, but in taking the road less traveled, you are able to experience new places you would not have otherwise.</p>
<h2>5. Practice Mindfulness</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/mindfulness-therapy-improve-mental-health/" target="_blank">When you focus on the here and now</a> rather than the past or future, you open yourself up to better enjoying each day and new experience. Focus on finding pleasure in all the small moments throughout your day and consciously choose to acknowledge them.</p>
<h2>Put Optimism into Practice</h2>
<p>Change is never easy, but taking a little bit of time each day to recalibrate your mindset can have a serious long-term positive impact. The smallest adjustments to your thinking and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/07/why-do-highly-sensitive-people-engage-in-routines/" target="_blank">routines</a> can make you more a more optimistic person over time — whether it comes naturally to you or not.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s easy to feel pressure to make, and then meet, life-changing resolutions at the start of each year. Maybe you pledge to lose 50 pounds, get in a workout in every day or go completely sugar free. But once January wraps up, many find themselves unable to fully realize them, leaving a lingering feeling of discouragement and frustration in its wake. But there is another way — setting realistic micro-goals.</p>
<p>The idea is simple: For any goal you are aiming to accomplish, micro-goals break down the large task into manageable, bite-sized parts. Rather than thinking about nailing that big-picture accomplishment, stay focused on achieving small nuggets of progress and go after them one tiny increment at a time.</p>
<p><span id="more-9305"></span></p>
<h2>Understanding the Impact of Micro-Goals</h2>
<p>If you are aiming to run a 5K, for instance, instead of approaching the task as simply “finish a 5K race,” chunk up each of the initial steps into achievable micro-goals worthy of celebration. First, wake up at 6 a.m. Next, get changed and put on your running shoes. After that, go outside and begin running. This can continue on throughout your training period, and before you realize it, you’re forcing productivity and progress.</p>
<p>Studies show that setting micro-goals can <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201305/the-secret-achieving-big-goal-is" target="_blank">rewire</a> your brain by increasing dopamine levels each time one is set and achieved. According to <i>Psychology Today</i>, “everything from making your bed to doing all the dishes will give you the ‘ding-ding-ding’ feeling of having completed a task. Neurobiologically the satisfaction of completing a task creates internal rocket fuel that energizes you to keep working towards your larger goal.”</p>
<p>It is human nature to believe there is a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/11/dont-forget-to-thank-the-most-important-person-in-your-life-you/" target="_blank">better version of us</a> out there on the horizon — the challenging part is figuring out exactly what it takes to make it a reality. We may gravitate toward believing grand gestures or quick changes can transform our thinking, but it is actually daily choices, or micro-goals, that shift and reinforce brain change. And each time you make headway, it will start to shift your perspective.</p>
<p><i>Harvard Business Review</i> <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/05/the-power-of-small-wins" target="_blank">researchers</a> found that making small strides toward big progress can actually increase a person’s happiness. “The more frequently people experience that sense of progress, the more likely they are to be creatively productive in the long run,” the article states. It doesn’t matter if you are working toward a major scientific breakthrough or simply want to make strides toward living a healthier life, tiny wins can make a big difference in how you feel and perform.</p>
<h2>How to Start Creating Micro-Goals</h2>
<p>If you are unsure how to start setting up micro-goals, start with the question: What is the one thing that, if accomplished, will make my life better? Perhaps you find that <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/how-to-eat-your-way-to-mental-health/" target="_blank">establishing more healthy eating habits</a> will bring you happiness or that <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/5-therapist-approved-ways-de-stress-day/" target="_blank">journaling every day</a> will make you more mindful. Then, start to parse out those micro-goals, which are small steps that take 5 to 10 minutes to complete to help you arrive at that optimal future state. Each time you check one off, stop to appreciate your accomplishment.</p>
<p>Achieving big aspirations should not be a painful process that is easy to fail. By breaking down significant ambitions into manageable parts, the hope is that a fear of coming up short won’t hold you back. With a fresh perspective, you may even begin to enjoy the journey and appreciate the growth process.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you Google the phrase &#8220;how to be happy,&#8221; you&#8217;ll be met with about 207 million answers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-much-money-you-need-be-happy-according-science-income-satisfaction-well-being" target="_blank">There’s the recent study</a> that examined how much money a person needs to make to lead the happiest and most satisfied life possible ($95,000/year for overall satisfaction, and $60-75,000 for day-to-day happiness). There’s <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/10/take-this-quiz-to-figure-out-how-to-be-happier-at-work" target="_blank">a quiz</a> on how to be happier at work, infinite mommy blogs detailing how to find personal happiness as a mom, wellness publications offering unconventional ways to boost happiness, religious content exploring what happiness looks like as a Christian &#8230; you get the point. Everyone has something to say about what it means to be happy. As a result, happiness feels almost like a myth.</p>
<p><span id="more-9166"></span></p>
<p>With so many <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/happiness-overrated-according-therapist/" target="_blank">people seeking happiness like the holy grail</a>, a question arises. What is happiness? Is there a singular answer to that question?</p>
<h2>History of Happiness</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with a little history lesson about the secular, Western concept of happiness, and how it evolved.</p>
<p>The root of the word happiness, “hap,” comes from Old Norse and Old English and translates as “luck” or “chance.” In contemporary German, the word “gluck” simultaneously means both “luck” and “happiness.” In this way, the ancient origins of happiness as a state of being lay completely outside the control of humans — only fate could bestow happiness.</p>
<p>By the classical philosophical era, particularly in the time of Aristotle circa 350 BC, the idea had changed. Aristotle and his contemporaries believed that happiness could be cultivated, as Darrin McMahon, author of <em>Happiness: A History</em>, suggests in <em><a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/happiness_the_hard_way#gsc.tab=0" target="_blank">Greater Good Magazine</a>: </em>that is, happiness is “not as an emotional state but as an outcome of moral comportment.” Or, as Aristotle said, “Happiness is a life lived according to virtue.”</p>
<p>Out of this tradition of classical thought was born the concept of <em>eudaimonia — </em>the cultivation of happiness through having a purpose in life through continued personal challenge and growth. On the other hand, hedonic happiness focused more on feeling pleasure and positive emotions. Aristotle acknowledged that both these branches of well-being could bring a sense of happiness, but the pursuit of eudaimonia, something beyond just pleasure, dominated.</p>
<h2>Modern Happiness</h2>
<p>This tradition stood until the age of Enlightenment in the 17th and 18th centuries, around the time Thomas Jefferson famously wrote something you may already be familiar with: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.”</p>
<p>Yes, happiness became a right, something we’re all entitled to strive for, not through the course of a “well-lived life,” like in Aristotle’s time, but by seeking something beyond ourselves. Happiness became a <em>pursuit. </em></p>
<p>Fast-forward to today and we have the mistaken idea that happiness is indeed our “natural state.” Often to our detriment, we’re told to “put on a happy face” at all costs. Capitalism offers us countless products on our quest to attain that permanent state of bliss — anti-aging creams, the most flavorful coffee, the hippest pair jeans — and yet we inevitably come up empty. We learn, even as children, that “bad” emotions should be shunned.</p>
<p>Lost is the idea that happiness is something that takes a certain amount of work, that can be accompanied by struggle and painful emotions. We’ve forgotten the knowledge that accumulating quick bursts of pleasure alone can’t flip the switch on eternal bliss. Luckily, modern science is shifting our perspective to something a little more balanced, which leads me to my next point&#8230;</p>
<h2>Subjective Well-Being</h2>
<p>Scientists today have been collating the various traditions of happiness into what <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/application_uploads/Diener-Subjective_Well-Being.pdf" target="_blank">they have termed “subjective well-being (SWB),”</a> the current definitive answer to the question, “What is happiness?”</p>
<p>SWB takes into account those old ideas of pleasure (hedonia) and meaning (eudaimonia) along with some of the concepts of positive psychology, including positive emotion, engagement in life, meaning, positive relationships, and accomplishment, and boils happiness down to three markers: experiencing positive emotions, low levels of negative moods, and high life satisfaction. So there you have it.</p>
<p>Most intriguingly, research has found an even more specific formula to what brings most people happiness. <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/lifestyle/2015/07/pursuit-happiness-what-happiness-and-how-can-we-make-ourselves-happier" target="_blank">Per Tosin Thompson’s SWB research</a> for NewStatesman, 50 percent of our well-being is determined by our genes, 10 percent by our circumstances in life, and a full 40 percent is determined by what we choose to do in our daily lives. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/05/gratitude-is-not-just-another-nine-letter-word-right/" target="_blank">Spending that time practicing gratitude</a>, giving to others, making meaningful connections with friends and partners, and taking time to enjoy what’s pleasurable — watching the sunset, exploring nature, learning to knit — will all tip the scales toward happiness.</p>
<h2>Happiness vs. Other Emotions</h2>
<p>Before we go any further, let’s address the elephant in the room. It’s hard to talk about happiness without also addressing <em>unhappiness</em>. You’ve heard the phrase (or song), “Don’t worry, be happy.” As if wishing our fears, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/when-does-normal-anxiety-become-a-mental-illness/" target="_blank">anxiety</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/dealing-depression-need-know/" target="_blank">depression</a>, pain, disappointment, anger, or grief away are that simple, or even, quite frankly, a good idea. You’ll notice, however, SWB calls for “low” levels of negative affect, not “zero” negative feelings ever. It’s about balance.</p>
<p>The truth is that negative emotions don’t stand in opposition to happiness. In fact, the opposite of happiness isn’t unhappiness, it’s apathy, the lack of any feeling at all.</p>
<p>“[Happiness] is inclusive of our moods, whether they be happy, sad, frustrated, or other emotional states,” therapist Janet Zinn tells <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talkspace" target="_blank">Talkspace</a>. “Happiness is about acceptance, though not resignation, of ourselves, and our life, while looking to see how we can grow and learn.”</p>
<h2>Finding YOUR Happiness</h2>
<p>So what does all this mean for <em>your</em> happiness?</p>
<p>“Happiness really is an inside job,” Los Angeles-based therapist Sarah Schewitz adds. “You can change the way you think, you can change the way you feel, and be happier.”</p>
<p>Well, as SWB implies, really, that’s kind of up to you and how you spend your 40 percent, even in the most dire circumstances or when <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/good-mental-health-12-therapist-approved-tips/" target="_blank">dealing with a mental health issue</a> — you can at least increase your feelings of well-being (maybe by giving <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-its-like-to-use-talkspace-text-therapy-app-2015-3" target="_blank">therapy</a> a try( even if it’s a fractional amount.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;<a href="http://pubx.co/jALYWz" target="_blank">Why We Can&#8217;t Wait Around for That Big Happy Moment</a>&#8221; originally appeared on Shine, a free daily text to help you thrive.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Many people lose the small joys in the hope for the big happiness” &#8211; Pearl S. Buck</p></blockquote>
<p>It was a chilly evening in my cramped Brooklyn apartment, so I lit a candle and rolled out a yoga mat. I got into Child’s Pose, and, out of nowhere, I started crying. It wasn’t just a few tears I could dab away with my shirtsleeve—it was a snot-induced, ugly cry. I asked myself, “Why do I feel so unhappy?”</p>
<p>I think about happiness a lot, and I often wonder if I think about the emotion more than I actually feel it. On my tear-stained yoga mat, I realized that I hold out for happiness. Maybe I’ll feel it momentarily, but it’s fleeting. I’m always thinking of the bigger picture and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-beauty-in-the-beast/201010/waiting-happiness" target="_blank">waiting to be happy</a>.<span id="more-8504"></span></p>
<p><em>“I’ll feel happy when I land my dream job.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I’ll feel happy when I land my dream job, but what if that never happens?”</em></p>
<p><em>“I got the job, but why didn’t I feel happy?”</em></p>
<p>As I came out of Child’s Pose, I sat and stared into the flickering candle flame. My cat glared at me as I wiped away my salty tears. In that moment, I recognized that <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=8m0fDgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT8&amp;dq=little+happiness&amp;ots=UvvoouBMdO&amp;sig=C06BkkHfL1lWqrFE9n0WNvB3G4k#v=onepage&amp;q=little%20happiness&amp;f=false" target="_blank">I had made happiness my end goal</a>, but I didn’t bother to make it a daily goal. I was so focused on my big happiness goals that I was missing out on the little things that can make me happy right here, right now—no wait required.</p>
<h2>What’s Happiness?</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/happy" target="_blank">To feel happy</a> is to feel joy, delighted, pleased, or content. “Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” is in the <a href="http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/" target="_blank">Declaration of Independence</a>, so everyone is entitled to be happy, right? But is everyone happy?</p>
<p>It all depends on how you define happiness. You can see it as achieving your goals or reaching your dreams—something you’ve been working at for a while, like buying your first house or starting a non-profit. You can also see happiness as all the little things in life, like the look on your dog’s face when you come home or when you won’t be charged extra for guacamole.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It has been a long axiom of mine that the little things are indefinitely the most important.” &#8211; Arthur Conan Doyle</p></blockquote>
<p>Studies show that happy people cherish the little things in life, whether they’re tangible objects or memorable moments. When we take the time to appreciate smaller joys, it helps us realize what we’re grateful for right now and it brings happiness into the present. And when we really savor these little moments, it can increase our happiness levels, too.</p>
<h2>How to Find Happiness Today</h2>
<p>So, how can you start to find happiness every day rather than hold out for it? Here are three tips:</p>
<p><strong>1. What Makes You Happy?</strong></p>
<p>After my yoga-and-cry session, I started writing a list of things that make me happy <a href="https://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-1-thing-you-can-do-right-now-to-achieve-your-goals/?utm_source=Shine&amp;utm_medium=Blog" target="_blank">right now</a>. It’s not a list of things that <em>will</em> make me happy, it’s a list of things that do make me happy.</p>
<p>The more I looked at the list, the more I realized I could be so much happier on a daily basis by intentionally doing what makes me happy, whether it’s buying my favorite pint of ice cream or simply taking a walk and enjoying nature.</p>
<p>Try making your own version of this list and stick it on your wall, or type it into a note on your phone. You can turn to it whenever you need a mood boost ASAP. You can even make it a goal to check off one thing on that list each day to cultivate happiness.</p>
<p><strong>2. Gratitude Is the Attitude</strong></p>
<p>If figuring out what makes you happy is difficult, ask, “<a href="http://motto.time.com/4225493/neuroscience-happy-rituals/?xid=motto_socialflow_twitter" target="_blank">What am I grateful for?</a>” Sometimes, it’s the little things that matter the most and the things we often don’t notice.</p>
<p>Someone once told me they write down three things they’re grateful for before they go to bed. I started doing this whenever I’d remember, and now it’s become a part of my routine.</p>
<p>Try getting into a similar habit of recapping what you’re thankful for. It can range from a roof over your head to a reliable bike that gets you to work, or even that cool bodega cat that lets you pet her. The more you think about what you’re <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier" target="_blank">grateful</a> and thankful for, the more you’ll see the things that give you joy each day.</p>
<p><strong>3. You Do You</strong></p>
<p>Don’t put your happiness in someone else’s hands. If you’re always waiting on people to cheer you up and they never pull through, stop waiting.</p>
<p>You are in charge of your happiness—use one of the tips above to learn what makes you happy, and then take action. It may sound difficult, but it gets easier the more you try. I know it has for me.</p>
<p>After my tearful yoga session, I took a closer look at what would make me happy today—not down the road. I remembered a photo project I found online called <a href="http://theconfettiproject.com/" target="_blank">The Confetti Project</a>. It’s a photo series to showcase <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYfytNz3AbU" target="_blank">what humans celebrate</a>, created by Brooklyn-based photographer Jelena Aleksich.</p>
<blockquote><p>You are in charge of your happiness.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve always loved pretending to be a model and having friends take photos of my outfits, and I realized I really wanted to be a part of this project. So I went for it—I booked an appointment for a photo shoot with this photographer, knowing nothing beyond the fact that I’d get to throw confetti in my photo.</p>
<p>I sat down and had a heart-to-heart with Jelena before she took out her camera. She asked me what I wanted to celebrate, and the answer came to me instantly: happiness. We talked about happiness, what it means to me, and why I was there in her photo studio.</p>
<p>Then, I got to dig into her jars and buckets of confetti. I grabbed handfuls of rainbow-colored confetti and tossed it up in the air, forgetting all my worries from the day. I spun around in circles and danced around to loud music. In that moment, I felt <em>happy</em>.</p>
<p>I hadn’t felt happy in such a long time that I’d almost forgot what it felt like, that sensation when your chest is so full of joy. I needed that moment of release. I needed to let go of my <a href="https://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-1-question-that-helps-me-combat-negative-thinking/?utm_source=Shine&amp;utm_medium=Blog" target="_blank">negative</a> thoughts and start to live again. I was going through the motions of life but wasn’t really enjoying it. I walked out of that cathartic photo shoot not only with some great photos for my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stephaniejadewong/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, but with a new perspective.</p>
<blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);" data-instgrm-version="7">

</div>
</blockquote>
<p><script async defer src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script></p>
<p>It’s easy to forget the little things when we’re always thinking about the future. But the truth is, you can’t get to the finish line without traveling the whole path, through all the bumps in the road. I still have <a href="https://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-youre-building-your-future-self-today/?utm_source=Shine&amp;utm_medium=Blog" target="_blank">long-term goals</a> to accomplish and dreams I want to chase, but now, I’m reminding myself on a daily basis how important it is to stop and smell the roses—or throw the confetti.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="https://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-to-learn-to-love-your-dark-side/" target="_blank">How I Learned to Love My Dark Side</a> originally appeared on <a href="https://www.shinetext.com/?utm_source=Talkspace&amp;utm_medium=Syndication" target="_blank">Shine</a>, a free daily text to help you thrive.</em></p>
<p>I’ll be the first to admit it: I’m sensitive. Like, we’re talking so sensitive that I can get <a href="https://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-to-take-the-stress-out-of-pressure/?utm_source=Shine&amp;utm_medium=Blog" target="_blank">stressed</a> out from watching <em>The Great British Bake Off</em> because I see the stress in the competitors faces as they race to put a Victoria sponge cake in the oven.</p>
<p>I’ve had people in my life give me flack for being so sensitive, and often I’m self-conscious that I’ll come off as weak or unable to handle what obstacles come my way. That’s why I consider sensitivity my “dark side.”<span id="more-8401"></span></p>
<h2>Embrace the Dark Side</h2>
<p>Our dark sides are the emotions and qualities about ourselves that we wish would go away. It’s less about what makes us seem evil, and more about what we’re embarrassed of—what feels wrong to us. For me, it’s my sensitivity, but for others it could be their anger, competitiveness, or apathy.</p>
<p>It’s easy to want to run away from the worst parts of ourselves or to ignore them completely. But just as <a href="https://advice.shinetext.com/articles/fighting-our-negative-emotions-does-more-harm-than-good/?utm_source=Shine&amp;utm_medium=Blog" target="_blank">fighting your less-than-ideal emotions</a> does more harm than good, so does not embracing your dark side.</p>
<p>Not owning who we are—good and bad—is harmful to our health. In a study published in the <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-30458-001" target="_blank">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</a>, researchers found that participants who accept, rather than judge, their mental experiences may attain better psychological health. The reason: Accepting our emotional imperfections makes them feel less detrimental and all-consuming. You might not be 100 percent happy about them, but, with acceptance, you can learn to manage how they affect you.</p>
<h2>The Flip Side of Your Dark Side</h2>
<p>A key to embracing your dark side: Knowing that every dark side has a light side. When we accept the traits we might not love, that’s when that light side can shine through.</p>
<p>“Every aspect of ourselves has a gift. Every emotion and every trait we possess helps show us the way to enlightenment, to oneness,” explains life coach Debbie Ford in her book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Dark-Side-Light-Chasers/dp/1594485259/?tag=psychcentral" target="_blank">The Dark Side of the Light Chasers</a></em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Know that every dark side has a light side.</p></blockquote>
<p>When I embrace my sensitivity, I see that it gives me one of my greatest skills: my empathy. Being sensitive means that I’m empathetic to friends who are having a hard time and need advice. Being sensitive makes me a better creative writer, because I can imagine realistic characters and be sensitive to how they’d react in situations. Basically, my sensitivity makes up some of my favorite parts of myself.</p>
<p>Perhaps your anxiety makes you cautious, which in return makes you the most prepared out of your friend group. Maybe you’re extremely judgemental, but that helps you from associating with people that weren’t right for you anyway. When we reflect on our dark sides, we can always a bit of light that exists.</p>
<h2>How to Pinpoint Your Dark Side</h2>
<p>In her book, Ford gives exercises to help you recognize what your specific dark side may be—and its “light side” counterpart.</p>
<p>To find your dark side, imagine a reporter wrote a newspaper article about you. Think: What five things do you hope the reporter <em>wouldn’t</em> say about you, and what five things would you be OK with the reporter saying?</p>
<p>After deciding your 10 qualities, she asks readers to reflect on each statement. Are the first five you wrote down things you see as “wrong”? Are the second five you wrote down things you see as “right”? Ford says to write down how you judge each of the ten statements. Then, consider: Where did those judgements come from? Why do you have them?</p>
<p>If the newspaper exercise seems too much, you can also ask yourself about which traits you see in others that you dislike. Why? Do you do these same things?</p>
<p>When exploring your judgements and what you see as “wrong,” you’ll hopefully begin to see a connecting theme in what you wish to suppress and hide about yourself. Once you’ve spotted your darkness, you can take the next step to seeing the light.</p>
<h2>How to See the Light</h2>
<p>Once you’ve recognized your dark side, Ford suggests making a list of all the times that your disliked emotion has been helpful to you. Once you have five to 10 solid examples, take the time to reflect over them and to notice patterns and similarities between examples. Like I did with my sensitivity, try to find the good in the dark.</p>
<p>Once you pinpoint your dark and light side, it’s helpful to know what triggers them. If you tend to be selfish, when does that happen? Are you triggered by threats to your resources, like seeing a friend devote time to their newest bestie? When you are confronted with your triggers, how do you react? Are there ways to react in a positive way? By asking yourself these questions and more, you can learn how to navigate tricky situations that confront you with your triggers.</p>
<p>Once you recognize your triggers, this also helps you communicate to loved ones how you might react in a certain situation. With my sensitivity, for example, I let people close to me know it’s often how I react in situations. I don’t apologize for it—I simply make others aware so they can better navigate our relationship. When we better understand ourselves, it only makes it easier on our loved ones to better love us.</p>
<blockquote><p>When we embrace our imperfections, we’re embracing being human.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just as the Pixar movie, Inside Out, reminded us that a healthy life includes joy <em>and</em> sadness, sometimes we need anger or disgust to communicate our true feelings and to get the support we need.</p>
<p>When we embrace our imperfections, we’re embracing being human. I’m learning to be proud of my sensitivity. After all, good things don’t have to be perfect. And now I know that our worsts parts are also some of our best parts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Often times people come into <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a> hoping to finally tackle issues like <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxiety</a> or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a>. Clients have come into my office wishing for me to share my keys to &#8220;happiness.&#8221; Sometimes they are disappointed to find I actually don&#8217;t think happiness is a reasonable goal.</p>
<p>There is a lot of information, particularly in the <a href="http://ppc.sas.upenn.edu/" target="_blank">positive psychology movement</a>, about finding the keys to happiness. You can use affirmations and daily validations to help lift your mood. You can organize your life and change your behavior, all in an effort to secure this feeling of happiness.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of validity to those suggestions. Nonetheless, I think it&#8217;s a bit of a stretch to search for &#8220;happiness&#8221; to begin with.<span id="more-5531"></span></p>
<p>Popular culture tells us happiness looks one specific way. What does happiness look like exactly? If you believe some advertising and commercials, happiness looks like a beautiful young woman with flowing blonde hair riding a bike in perfect, sunny weather. For others happiness looks like the jubilation we witness in our children&#8217;s faces as they open presents on Christmas morning.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t fit that mold of what happy looks like, you may feel like you&#8217;re failing. You might internalize that failure to mean something negative and dark about yourself. Somehow you must be inherently flawed and unable to feel happy. We easily forget that happiness is fleeting, not a constant state. The concept of “hedonic adaptation” helps explain this. Essentially the concept relates to how people adapt to new stimuli — whether good or bad — but always recentering to an emotional baseline. The famous <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/690806" target="_blank">study of lottery winners</a> returning to their pre-winning emotional state is only one example of how chasing “happiness” can lead to frustration.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that you’re not the one who is failing. It&#8217;s our culture that&#8217;s failing us. Because we have such a limited and rigid view of happiness that we all struggle to live up to, whenever we don&#8217;t fit this mold we find ourselves riddled with anxiety and struggling with despair. Happiness isn&#8217;t a fruitful goal at all.</p>
<p>I think we should be more focused on attaining peace.</p>
<h2>Peace Above Happiness</h2>
<p>Whereas happiness is a state of mind that exists moment by moment, I like to think of peace as a never-ending thread that can exist in your day-to-day life. When we feel peace, there is a sense of comfort and emotional security even when we are faced with difficult times.</p>
<p>Think about how hard it can be to try to be &#8220;happy&#8221; when you&#8217;re going through a divorce. How can you feel &#8220;happy&#8221; when you&#8217;ve recently lost a loved one to a serious illness? It&#8217;s common for those around us to push us to heal and be happier quicker than is reasonable.</p>
<p>Inner peace can give us a sense of acceptance no matter what comes our way. With inner peace, even if negative emotions pop up, we&#8217;ll be able to deal with them and power through.</p>
<p>Achieving a sense of peace requires both effort and time. One of the best ways I have found — and that I encourage my clients to use — is mindfulness. Mindfulness can not only reduce anxiety in the moment, but can also help produce an overall greater sense of inner peace and balance.</p>
<h2>Mindfulness as a Key to Peace</h2>
<p>Daily meditation or exercises like progressive muscle relaxation can be great tools in reducing your daily anxiety levels and preventing the impact of stressors on your day-to-day experience. Once these practices become routine, you may find yourself living more in the moment and enjoying life just a little bit more.</p>
<p>If you find yourself struggling with persistent feelings of anxiety and depression, I would recommend that you give yourself 10 minutes per day you can use to meditate, draw, create, or simply breathe.</p>
<p>Allowing yourself to have this quiet time for reflection can be the first step in achieving a sense of peace and emotional security that&#8217;s going to help you tackle life&#8217;s events as they come. You can also consider working with a therapist, who may have additional suggestions for finding peace and stability. They can act as a coach or advisor, while providing a useful sounding board during stressful times.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Weight loss/fitness is the most popular New Year’s resolution and the one the highest number of people give up on soon after they proudly declare it. Wouldn’t you rather pick a New Year’s resolution that’s easy to stick to?</p>
<p>Do you want your resolution to make you happier in two seconds or less? You can, right now. But you need to do something very simple:</p>
<p>SMILE!<span id="more-3438"></span></p>
<p>Maybe, even as you read that word, you smiled! And maybe you noticed at that moment you smiled, you felt a bit better. Maybe you even acknowledged you can be happier.</p>
<p>So, smile. Often.</p>
<p>Smiling is something you can do consciously and purposefully, and it has an impact on how you feel. Studies have shown <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/48815454/ns/health-mens_health/t/smiling-may-lower-your-heart-rate/#.Vo11KJMrKkc" target="_blank">smiling can reduce heart rate</a>. Smiling can also be an <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/simply-smiling-can-actually-reduce-stress-10461286/?no-ist" target="_blank">effective antidote to stress</a>. Try it out yourself. When you are in a stressful situation, put on a smile and feel the difference. The phrase ‘grin and bear it’ has some validity.</p>
<p>This might be even easier depending on your gender and nationality. Women smile more than men and the English smile less than many other groups because of their ideas about the virtues of the “stiff upper lip” and not appearing emotional. Children smile roughly 400 times a day, adults only 20 times a day. It’s time to embrace your inner child.</p>
<p>There are so many ways to do it, too. Take a look at people smiling, see if you can notice <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/10/the-7-types-of-smiles-and-how-people-perceive-them/" target="_blank">different types of smiles</a>. There is the ‘felt’ smile, which is a genuine, spontaneous expression of happiness. There is the ‘dampened’ smile, which is when a person tries to suppress a big grin. There is the ‘compliance’ smile in which we show we are in agreement, even though we might have preferred another option. Then there is the ‘listener response’ smile, which says, “I hear you, continue.”</p>
<p>All of these will help you because the simple act of smiling produces a lot of positive brain chemistry. When a person smiles, regardless of which type of smile, the brain releases endorphins. People refer to endorphins as ‘happy chemicals’ the brain produces naturally. These happy chemicals then lead to more smiling, which produces more happy chemicals and leads toward more smiling. It doesn’t matter if you ‘fake’ a smile. The muscle movements involved in smiling are the same, and the happy chemicals start to flow. Just as you can imagine drinking a glass of lemonade and beginning to salivate, you can pretend to smile and generate happy chemicals that further support smiling.</p>
<p>Happy people smile more. And if we smile more, we will be happier. So, be happier this New Year. Smile more!</p>
