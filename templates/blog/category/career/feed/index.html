				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people struggle with the fear of success, fear of closeness, or fear of happiness. Let’s say your father suffered from depression and ranted about the workplace being a dog-eat-dog environment where everyone has to watch his back.</p>
<p>As a child, you, like all kids, want to think of your father as intelligent and perceptive. You listened to him and thought that his worldview made sense. Even if you later realized, as an adult, that your father was a very negative and depressed person, his impact on your own worldview may be very difficult to change.</p>
<p>Although it isn’t rational, many people subconsciously steer themselves away from experiences where they feel good about themselves, or where they end up feeling happy. But why is this and what can you do about it?</p>
<p><span id="more-10889"></span></p>
<h2>The Root of Fears of Success and Happiness</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/negative-thinking-got-you-down-heres-how-to-shift-your-thoughts/" target="_blank">negative</a> or depressive worldview is often at the root of the fear of feeling good. There is a psychological phenomenon called <strong>confirmation bias</strong>, which means that people subconsciously seek out experiences that confirm the way that they already think of themselves and the world.</p>
<p>If you grow up in <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/when-does-family-drama-become-toxic/" target="_blank">a home where everyone felt and acted very negative</a>, then it is probable that you currently view the world and yourself through a negative lens. This means that you are likely drawn to experiences that end up making you feel bad about yourself, or that confirm your preconception that the world is a bad place.</p>
<h2>How a Negative Worldview Affects You in the Workplace</h2>
<p>When you go to work, you may subconsciously be looking around for evidence that others are out to get you or want to harm you in some way.</p>
<p>You may steer clear of evidence that would run counter to this worldview, which would mean that you don’t try that hard to socialize with people in the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/millennials-guide-mental-illness-workplace/" target="_blank">workplace</a>, and instead keep your guard up. You may turn down invitations to happy hour, and instead stick to your familiar mantra that you can’t trust anyone and you wouldn’t have enjoyed hanging out with those people anyway.</p>
<h2>Fear of Happiness in Relationships</h2>
<p>In another common example, people who don’t think highly of themselves end up with partner or even <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/types-friends-bad-mental-health/" target="_blank">friends who treat them poorly</a>. If you think that you aren’t deserving of respect or love, then you subconsciously are attracted to people who act disrespectfully and unkindly.</p>
<p>When people with low self-esteem meet potential partners who treat them well, they often say they aren’t attracted to these people for some reason or other. In actuality, the reason for the lack of attraction may be the fear of finally feeling happy, finally letting your guard down…only to be blindsided by rejection or failure.</p>
<h2>Unhappiness as a Vicious Cycle&#8230;</h2>
<p>If you are used to feeling bad about yourself, then it is more comfortable and easier to continue putting yourself in unfulfilling situations. Taking the risk of aiming higher may feel too intimidating, as it could lead to potential disappointment.</p>
<p>This is why so many people <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/4-signs-youre-self-sabotaging-how-to-stop/" target="_blank">self-sabotage</a> their chances for romantic, career, or social success. It is more familiar to lurk on the outskirts of life than to take a running jump into the middle of it, and potentially fail dramatically.</p>
<h2>… and How to Break this Cycle</h2>
<p>If you struggle with the fear of success, or the fear of happiness, a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/10/heres-makes-good-therapist-17-signs-look/" target="_blank">good therapist</a> can often help you understand why you keep getting in your own way. Often, when you work on your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/self-esteem/" target="_blank">self-esteem</a> and are better able to respect and love yourself, opportunities for happiness and success will seem to almost magically arise.</p>
<p>In fact, this isn’t magic, but just the same opportunities that arise for everyone, that have been there all along, but that you were refusing to allow yourself to see and act on.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For as long as I remember, I’ve wanted to be a journalist.</p>
<p>Even before I knew of Sex and the City’s Carrie Bradshaw, The Devil Wears Prada’s Andy Sachs or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days’ Andie, I knew I was destined to chase deadlines. So, when I graduated during the recession of 2008 and was given my first full-time editorial opportunity, I knew how much of a privilege it was. I was elated to be fulfilling a 10-year dream.</p>
<p>Even though it was a <i>very</i> junior position for a <i>very</i> small magazine publisher, I knew it was an important stepping stone, and I wanted to give it my all. So, I took on <i>everything</i>.</p>
<p>You need your three-hour interview transcribed? I’m on it. Six pieces need to be written and published by Monday? Don’t ask anyone else, my weekend is yours. Slowly, I began to be seen as the one in the office you could count on doing what you didn’t want to do.</p>
<p><span id="more-10895"></span></p>
<h2>Why Being a “Yes” Person is Detrimental to Your Career</h2>
<p>A few months into the job, the editor-in-chief of the company asked me into his office. My anxious brain was on fire — was I being promoted (ideally, to his job) or was I being fired?</p>
<p>He sat me down and said, “Ladan, you need to learn how to say ‘no.’ You can’t <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/why-successful-people-struggle-with-mental-illness/" target="_blank">succeed personally and professionally</a> otherwise.” I was shocked — I’d been working around the clock to be the “yes girl,” and instead of my work being rewarded, it was being reprimanded?</p>
<p>Mike had a great point, as those older and wiser than us tend to It was a point that has helped me more than any feedback in my career so far.</p>
<p>While you may think you’re being a go-getter — nose to the grindstone, doing good work and always with a can-do attitude — others may see your willingness to take everything on as pushover behavior. This leads people to pass off their work onto you, causing you to take blame or work harder than you have to. Being taken advantage of can make you feel stifled in the workplace and lead to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/how-staying-in-a-job-you-hate-affects-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">career stagnation</a>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://courses.talkspace.com/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_MID&amp;utr_content=affordable&amp;utr_adgroup=midpost-cta&amp;WPpost_id=10895&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/09/assert-yourself-at-work/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4880 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/e-course-blog-cta.png" alt="talkspace guide to overcoming stress at work CTA" width="660" height="240" /></a></p>
<h2>How to Be Assertive at Work</h2>
<p>The key is to stand up for yourself and be assertive, which is easier said than done. But Leigh Steere, co-founder of <a href="http://www.managingpeoplebetter.com/mpb/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Managing People Better</a>, a management research company, offers three quick ways to start developing this skill in your career.</p>
<h3>1. Use “I” statements</h3>
<p>Using “I” statements creates clarity in your workplace desires, and leaves less room for behavior that can be used to take advantage of you.</p>
<p>Take this statement, for example: “When I hear blonde jokes in the break room, I understand that the intent is humor, but it’s humor at someone else’s expense. Let&#8217;s change the topic.”</p>
<p>In this example, the speaker states the problem in a matter-of-fact way and makes a specific request. There is no name-calling, no blame — just a simple statement and a simple request.</p>
<h3>2. Frame the topic by highlighting benefits for the employer</h3>
<p>By phrasing your desires in way that signals you’re team player, or have everyone’s best interests in mind, you open yourself to more respect from colleagues or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/boss-affecting-mental-health/" target="_blank">management</a>. It shows you consider the bigger picture, and the potential impact on your workplace and its business objectives.</p>
<p>For example: “Currently, our team calls out questions across our workspace. This means everyone is hearing every question, which is distracting. I would like to brainstorm alternatives as a team that could help boost our group&#8217;s productivity.”</p>
<p>Again, the speaker states the problem matter-of-factly and makes a specific request. By suggesting a course of action and a possible business advantage, the speaker comes across as a problem-solver, not a whiner.</p>
<h3>3. Make your reason clear</h3>
<p>Being more specific about the reason for your requests or feedback reveals to others the full context of your needs. This clarity helps reduce subsequent questioning, which can lead to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/09/imposter-syndrome-prevents-success/" target="_blank">doubts about your capabilities</a> or ability to communicate effectively in the workplace.</p>
<p>For example: “I need access to the file room in order to complete XYZ parts of this project. Can I borrow the key?”</p>
<p>Notice how this is a simple statement and specific request, not a complaint.</p>
<h2>How to Apply Your Assertiveness</h2>
<p>While it’s not an easy behavior change, with some simple steps and practice, you can get much more comfortable with the idea of speaking up for yourself. The key is prep and practice.</p>
<p>“When wanting to find ways to assert yourself at work, it’s important to start with prep work,” said <a href="http://embracingjoy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Melissa Divaris Thompson</a>, a licensed psychotherapist in New York City.</p>
<p>“First, get clear about what you want. It’s important to first know what you want and need and why. Getting clear about why this really matters will help you stick your ground later on, Thompson says. “Second, practice. Find a trusted friend and practice talking about what you need before you assert yourself at work. If a face-to-face is too scary for you to start, consider an email to lay it out. It’s important then to follow up in person. This way you won’t change your mind mid conversation and you can be clear and direct in your email.”</p>
<p>Thompson also recommends to just do it — no matter how you assert yourself, you may make someone irritated. People will choose to respond to you in any way they choose, even if you present your needs perfectly.</p>
<p>Just remember that no matter what level, you have a right to assert yourself at work in a respectful clear and grounded way.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Work. It wakes us in the middle of the night, it consumes a majority of our days, and yet we rely on it to provide for the actual life we want to lead. Given its significance and presence in your life, it’s sad to experience work as empty or, worse, dreadful — sapping energy from your soul.</p>
<p>But so many workers do. According to a 2015 Gallup survey, <a href="https://www.inc.com/sonia-thompson/68-percent-of-employees-are-disengaged-but-there-i.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">less than a third</a> of employees are fully engaged in their jobs.</p>
<p><span id="more-10823"></span></p>
<p>The study also found that it doesn’t matter how big your paycheck is — money alone isn’t always a sustainable <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/maintain-motivation-depressed/" target="_blank">motivational driver</a>. And it doesn’t matter what your title is — a label often has no connection to meaning or motivation. So, how is it that some people can be extremely well-paid and work in pampered settings but feel disengaged, while others can work in far less than ideal situations and feel fulfilled?</p>
<h2>Finding Meaning in Our Work</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.karencarlucci.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Karen Carlucci</a>, a licensed clinical social worker and therapist in New York City, it’s all about meaning.</p>
<p>“Meaning is what gives us drive, and people often find meaning in their work when they experience being needed and appreciated,” she said. “This fosters a sense of purpose which can develop in any job within any work environment. The job itself is not as important as the rapport with the boss and co-workers and how one’s work is received. Once a sense of purpose is established, motivation to commit to a job and do it well will follow.”</p>
<p>How can you find meaning in your job and work more happily on a consistent basis? Here are a few ideas to get you started:</p>
<h3>1. Seek out meaning</h3>
<p>Identify what you are passionate about. Figuring out what you care about will give you direction and a feeling of purpose. Jennifer Way, CEO of <a href="https://waysolutions.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Way Solutions</a>, an HR consulting and career management company, recommends asking yourself these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What initially attracted you to the role?</li>
</ul>
<p>Refocusing on what initially interested you about the role can help reframe any negativity you might have about your position.</p>
<ul>
<li>How are you a key contributor?</li>
</ul>
<p>What gifts and talents are you utilizing in your current role? What value do you bring to your role? Focusing on the contribution you’re making can help you feel a connection to the “greater good.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there projects at work that interest you?</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there a project coming up that you might be interested in being a part of? This can challenge you to think outside your current role, spark your imagination, and introduce you to other co-workers that you don’t typically interact with.</p>
<p><a href="https://courses.talkspace.com/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_MID&amp;utr_content=affordable&amp;utr_adgroup=midpost-cta&amp;WPpost_id=10823&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/09/find-meaning-at-work-tips/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4880 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/e-course-blog-cta.png" alt="talkspace guide to overcoming stress at work CTA" width="660" height="240" /></a></p>
<h3>2. Build out relationships</h3>
<p>According to Gallup, people who have a best friend at work are <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/good-relationships.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">seven times more likely</a> to be engaged in their jobs. But no pressure for this person to be a <i>best</i> friend: Gallup found that people who simply have a good friend in the workplace are more likely to be satisfied.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to find more meaning in your job, schedule some time to work on <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/relationships/" target="_blank">building relationships</a> — even if it’s just 30 minutes a week.</p>
<h3>3. Look outside</h3>
<p>If a work bestie doesn’t seem to be an option, you can always look outside your office walls.</p>
<p>“A sense of community professionally doesn’t have to be limited to the workplace,” Jennifer Way said. “Research professional networks outside of your workplace where you can connect with others in your profession. Are there people in your industry you’d be interested in having lunch or coffee with on a regular basis?”</p>
<h3>4. Change your attitude</h3>
<p>Having a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/12/this-simple-attitude-change-will-dramatically-improve-your-quality-of-life/" target="_blank">good attitude</a> at work is extremely powerful and can be a precursor to feeling happier in your role. While it’s often easier said than done (and easier for some roles than others), a good attitude is something that can come with practice and mindfulness. Consider working on your interpersonal skills — if you learn to consider others more thoughtfully, they will respond in a kind way and make your work more satisfying.</p>
<h2>Work Is About Fulfillment, No Matter the Reason</h2>
<p>Ask yourself: Do you love your job? Or do you dread Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday (and perhaps even those hours before lunch on Friday)? If you want to find meaning in it, remember to look beyond the mundane tasks and focus on the end result that will bring you fulfillment — even if it’s just the paycheck.</p>
<p>“It is absolutely ok for someone to go to work just for the paycheck,” Carlucci said. “What finding meaning at work really comes down to is values. What are our must haves? What gets us out of bed in the morning day after day? What do we care about most? If the answer is money regardless of where and how we earn it, that’s fine. The important thing is to recognize our core values and honor them. That will lead us to a more aligned work life and yield the meaning to forge ahead.”<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You go forth into the world to follow your dreams and shine your beautiful light — only to feel like a fraud on the inside. You begin working on something, and self-doubt and anxiety creep into your brain. So, you choose over preparation and exert overreaching effort. You may even accomplish your goal through luck. But truly, you just want relief, and it comes only temporarily, until you push back any form of positive feedback — resulting in a loop back to anxiety and feeling like a fraud.</p>
<p>This is the cycle of imposter syndrome.</p>
<p><span id="more-10805"></span></p>
<p>The invasion of imposter syndrome can affect the progression of your career and personal life. Some people are more vulnerable than others, such as those with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxiety</a> or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a>; severe cases of imposter syndrome and its depressive effects may even lead to suicidal behaviors or self-harm. You may also harm yourself emotionally or spiritually through <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/4-signs-youre-self-sabotaging-how-to-stop/" target="_blank">self-sabotage</a>. You may feel paranoid, emotionally distressed, isolated, and invisible.</p>
<h2>Imposter Syndrome Places Limits on Your Life</h2>
<p>Experiencing imposter syndrome means, on a daily basis, you face the distortion of thought that you may be lazy, unintelligent, or incompetent. You fear you’ve taken “fake it until you make it” too literally and wonder when you’ll actually succeed. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/12/this-simple-attitude-change-will-dramatically-improve-your-quality-of-life/" target="_blank">Self-doubt</a> and negative self-talk affect your day-to-day life as you undercut your value.</p>
<p>In severe cases, when the effects of imposter syndrome snowball, your performance at work may fall so low that your worst fears come true — your hesitance, avoidance or constant apology result in self-sabotage.</p>
<p>It may be that you’re afraid of judgment from an authority figure. Physical reactions to stress include shaking, startled reactions, dry mouth, and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/the-surprising-new-connection-between-sleep-and-mental-health/" target="_blank">insomnia</a> — look for these signs as you note triggers.</p>
<p>You may also overcompensate in self-harming ways by setting poor boundaries, taking on more work than you should, staying late. This creates tension in your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/working-hard-burning-out/" target="_blank">work-life balance</a>, adding to your stress.</p>
<p>Imposter syndrome places limits on your potential and ability to live your life enjoyably, with satisfaction and to the fullest.</p>
<h2>What Research Says About Imposter Syndrome</h2>
<p>In the 1970s, Suzanne Imes and Pauline Clance discovered the phenomenon when <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1979-26502-001" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">their research</a> found many high-achieving women felt like frauds. The syndrome, however, affects both women and men.</p>
<p>Follow-up studies report <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_ladder/2016/04/is_impostor_syndrome_real_and_does_it_affect_women_more_than_men.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">no differences in imposter feelings</a> among women and men. Imposter syndrome affects multiple demographics and backgrounds — workers in various industries say they feel like frauds. Unfortunately, people still talk about it as a women’s issue because women are more likely to speak up about their experiences of feeling like imposters.</p>
<p>People like to say millennials are narcissists, but <a href="https://thehustle.co/why-70-percent-of-millennials-have-impostor-syndrome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">70 percent of them feel like imposters</a>. Also, people who feel the need to continually challenge themselves may be more at risk for imposter syndrome.</p>
<h2>Effectively Overcoming Imposter Syndrome</h2>
<p>You can find relief for imposter syndrome through mentoring, self-help, or counseling like that provided by <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)</a>.</p>
<p>Opening up to those you trust in your social and professional circles may also help. Has a friend previously expressed feeling like a fraud to you? Do you have a mentor you can turn to with your feelings of doubt? Your life and job have unique demands, and you need someone you can relate to who will help ground you.</p>
<p>Start by challenging your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/negative-thinking-got-you-down-heres-how-to-shift-your-thoughts/" target="_blank">negative self-talk</a> and worst-case scenarios. Accept them and develop a plan of action to strategize proactive steps to head off this negativity. Track your successes and compliments. Return to these when you feel less than confident about your abilities.</p>
<p>Imposter syndrome is a psychological phenomenon keeps you from internalizing your accomplishments. When others provide proof of your success or competence, or give you praise, you dismiss it as timing or luck. You may not feel deserving of praise, but the truth is that everyone feels like a fraud at some point.</p>
<p>Once you recognize these feelings, you can take steps to make things better and feel like the success you truly are.</p>

<p><span id="more-10531"></span></p>
<p>Statistics pile onto the correlation between mental illness and success. A 2008 <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1136888" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study</a> published in the <i>University of Cincinnati Law Review</i> suggests that CEOs may be at twice the risk of developing <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/dealing-depression-need-know/" target="_blank">depression</a> compared to the general population. University of California San Francisco researcher Dr. Michael Freeman found in 2015 that <a href="http://www.michaelafreemanmd.com/Research_files/Are%20Entrepreneurs%20Touched%20with%20Fire%20(pre-pub%20n)%204-17-15.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">49 percent</a> of entrepreneurs who started a company have experienced a mental illness. The organization Help Musicians UK found in a 2016 <a href="https://www.helpmusicians.org.uk/assets/publications/files/1st_nov_can_music_make_you_sick_part_1-_pilot_survey_report_.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">survey</a> that 71.1 percent of musicians reported <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/anxiety-attack-vs-panic-attack-one/" target="_blank">panic attacks</a> or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/different-types-anxiety-disorders-classified/" target="_blank">anxiety</a> while 68.5 percent struggled with depression.</p>
<p>Whether they’re savvy businesspeople, creative artists and writers, or high-performing individuals, why do so many successful people struggle with mental illness? The answer may pose a bit of a chicken and the egg conundrum — which came first? The mental illness or the success?</p>
<h2>Connecting Success and Mental Illness</h2>
<p>When we look closer, one reason that mental illness and high achievement might go hand-in-hand has to do with what it takes to be successful in the first place.</p>
<p>“Many of the characteristics needed to be a successful entrepreneur align with some symptoms of mental illness,” <a href="http://laconciergepsychologist.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dr. Crystal I. Lee</a>, owner of LA Concierge Psychologist, tells Talkspace. “For example, those with bipolar disorder think big and reach for the stars. They can be visionaries that think outside of the box and create highly ambitious goals and plans.”</p>
<p>Accordingly, qualities that describe a great entrepreneur or creative person, someone willing to take the risks often necessary to achieve success, overlap with mental health conditions. Freeman, as a result of his study, identifies for <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2016/02/10/technology/silicon-valley-depression-austen-heinz/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CNN</a> “creativity, extroversion, open mindedness, and a propensity for risk” as some of these characteristics. Dr. David Linden, a neuroscience professor at Johns Hopkins’ School of Medicine, adds to the list in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2013/08/06/why-the-brains-of-high-powered-people-may-be-more-prone-to-addiction/#303065543736" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Forbes</i></a>, “obsession, dedication, novelty-seeking, [and] strong drive for success.”</p>
<p>Many of these same traits are hallmarks of a variety of mental illnesses and addictions, such as obsession with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/ocd-versus-everyday-worries/" target="_blank">obsessive-compulsive disorder</a> or risk and novelty-seeking with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/know-kind-bipolar/" target="_blank">bipolar disorder</a>. Though having these characteristics of course doesn’t always signal a mental health condition, in some cases they could be the very reason people with mental illnesses excel at their chosen calling.</p>
<p>“As we can see with some highly successful people, people can absolutely thrive while struggling with their mental health,” says Lee. “It&#8217;s important to see that they&#8217;re able to be successful because their environment capitalizes on the individual’s strengths…It&#8217;s a matter of the environment (i.e., job) matching the strengths of the individual.”</p>
<h2>Pressures of Success</h2>
<p>There’s more to the story, however. Success comes with a price, whether it’s high-stakes financial responsibility, performance expectations, or a level of fame and public scrutiny. All that stress and pressure on top of growing demands can lead straight to the beginnings of larger issues.</p>
<p>“On a practical level, it’s very difficult to balance a demanding career and your well-being,” <a href="https://melodywilding.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Melody Wilding</a>, a licensed social worker and career coach who works with high-achievers, tells Talkspace. “As you rise higher, you also face greater pressure to perform, which can lead to self-doubt. The flip side of being smart and accomplished is that it’s easy to fall into traps of overthinking and worrying.”</p>
<p>Success can also breed isolation and self-neglect. When a business venture really takes off, it requires a lot of time and headspace to manage. That can push aside many of the social connections and centering moments that would otherwise support our mental health.</p>
<p>“When you start having elitist big jumps upwards, then things change,” psychologist Deborah Serani told <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2015/01/26/why-the-super-successful-get-depressed/#5fe992c12b1a" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Forbes</i></a>. “There’s a lot of disconnect from simple things, like sitting down for dinner with your family…That’s the stuff that brings texture and joy to life, and people may lose a lot of that richness when they’re consumed with a business 24/7.”</p>
<p>If left unchecked, the balance between success and mental health may tip from stress and burnout to a full-blown mental illness.</p>
<p>“Being at the top meant there is little time for self-care, family time, or moments of stillness — a recipe for burnout,” says Lee. “The incredible stress of being a successful person can actually trigger episodes of mental illness.”</p>
<p><a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/online-therapy-with-a-licensed-therapist?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_MID&amp;utr_adgroup=midpost-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=10531&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/why-successful-people-struggle-with-mental-illness/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4858 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/darkblue_toughtime.png" alt="tough time blog purchase CTA" width="660" height="240" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/darkblue_toughtime.png 660w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/darkblue_toughtime-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a></p>
<h2>The Stigma of Getting Help</h2>
<p>Getting help for mental illness still carries a stigma across the board, but for successful people who feel pressure to stay on top, admitting it’s time to get help can be an even bigger hurdle. This may be another reason why so many successful people struggle with mental illness.</p>
<p>“People who are highly accomplished fear being perceived as weak or incapable. They pride themselves on being able to ‘do it all’ — it’s part of their identity,” says Wilding. “Because of this, they tend to have a harder time asking for help. They tell themselves to toughen up and work harder, which only makes things worse.”</p>
<p>Still, for those who are struggling, it’s critical to reach out for help. A mental health professional is best equipped to help us heal and get our stride back. Mental illness isn’t usually something we can or should handle alone. And though access to quality mental health care has a financial barrier for many, those who are successful may face others treatment challenges.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s harder for them to access quality care. They don&#8217;t necessarily have time to go out and see a therapist, and they end up suffering in silence,” says Lee, who runs a concierge practice.</p>
<h2>Redefining Success</h2>
<p>Whether it’s the fact that successful careers favor characteristics shared with many mental illnesses, the stress and pressure of success itself, or the strong stigma against seeking help, there’s also an opportunity to revolutionize the way we think about mental health as a society. Personal disclosure is always a choice, but when successful people open up about their own struggles, it can have a big impact on those around us.</p>
<p>“When people see people who are leaders in their industry harnessing their illness&#8217; strengths and/or rising above the struggles, it gives people another understanding of what it means to live with mental illness,” says Lee. “It gives people hope and it humanizes the struggle for those who don&#8217;t struggle and never have. It&#8217;s no longer this scary thing; it&#8217;s a person they know of and might even admire.”</p>
<p>As for how we can support those who are successful navigate mental illness — and all of us who struggle with anything, really — it may just come down to re-defining what success means.</p>
<p>“For too long I think we have defined success in terms of status and money alone,” Wilding says. “But true success is being comfortable in your own skin and understanding who you are.”</p>
<p>Those are words of wisdom we can get behind.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One-third of our life is spent at work. That’s nearly <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/disturbing-facts-about-your-job-2011-2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">90,000 hours</a> of life. Suffice it to say that if you are spending that much time at work, it needs to be a positive environment that does not compromise your mental health. And the relationship with your boss is maybe the most vital piece for a healthy workplace.</p>
<p><span id="more-10542"></span></p>
<p>In fact, it can make it or break your work experience. There’s a thin line between a boss being a weak leader or incapable of managing a team, and being toxic and draining. Both can impact your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/how-staying-in-a-job-you-hate-affects-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">mental health</a>. Another type of boss is one that has zero boundaries in the name of being “friends” with you. An example of this would be listening to your boss dish at the office to you about their marriage, kids, wild nights out, and personal life. We don’t always peg that type of employee/boss relationship as harmful to our mental health, as many times we perceive it as the fact that they are trusting us with valuable info, but it can take a toll and can lead to uncomfortable or inappropriate situations.</p>
<p>If any scenarios below sound familiar it may be time to recalibrate your relationship with your boss so that it doesn’t negatively impact your mental health. If you have been in therapy or are familiar with self improvement, you are familiar with the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3061314/3-ways-to-set-work-life-boundaries-with-your-overbearing-boss" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“B” word — boundaries</a>.</p>
<p>Many times, we are intimidated to establish <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/guide-setting-healthy-boundaries-relationships/" target="_blank">boundaries</a> with someone once a negative pattern has been initiated, but it’s never too redefine or re-establish boundaries — in the long term, they’ll keep you happier, and more productive at work.</p>
<h2>Dealing with the Uncommunicative Boss</h2>
<h3>Defining Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Nonchalant</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Lack of direction</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Fears confrontation</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This type of boss perhaps means well, but they have difficulty leading and managing a team — and especially in communicating their expectations clearly. Perhaps it’s because they feel inferior, or perhaps it’s because they’re afraid of not being liked by everyone on the team. Reality alert: this isn’t your problem, and you need to establish boundaries so that they don’t punt on their authority and responsibilities, while trying not to get their hands dirty.</p>
<p>Additional work put on your plate results in more stress and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/different-types-anxiety-disorders-classified/" target="_blank">anxiety</a>, which directly impacts your mental health. It’s important to be honest and upfront with your boss and let them know when something is their responsibility or your need help with something. It’s important to recalibrate expectations and workloads so that responsibilities and duties are not being shifted due to their poor leadership skills. It’s never an easy conversation to have, but your boss/employee relationship (and your mental health) will be better for it.</p>
<h2>Dealing with an Authoritative Boss</h2>
<h3>Defining Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Harsh </em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Abrasive</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Intense</em></li>
</ul>
<p>A boss with extreme mood swings, outlandish expectations, and intensity can be one of the most difficult, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/cutting-edge-leadership/201802/the-10-habits-highly-toxic-bosses" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">toxic types of bosses</a> to work with. This boss’s overly demonstrative, bullying ways can sometimes verge into emotional or verbal abuse and can actually be the most detrimental to your well-being.</p>
<p>This type of boss causes us to undervalue ourselves, putting self-love and self-care on the back burner. Resetting boundaries with this person can be tricky but is essential to maintaining your mental health — and self respect. The best way to reset this relationship is to do the work expected of you, and help colleagues do the same, but maintain firm boundaries in regards to tasks and hours.</p>
<p>If your bosses behavior doesn’t improve after setting a meeting to go over your concerns, it may be time to bring in your HR department and explain how the bullying management style is affecting your mental health. With luck, the matter will then be dealt with professionally and anonymously. Talk to your therapist if you have any questions or concerns on how to facilitate these conversations tactfully and professionally.</p>

<h2>Dealing with an Unprofessional Boss</h2>
<h3>Defining Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Divulges too much of their personal life (or asks for the details of yours)</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Passive aggressive</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Views employees as peers</em></li>
</ul>
<p>TV&#8217;s most loved boss, Michael Scott, may make us laugh during a TBS Office Marathon, but when you&#8217;re dealing with this person IRL, it&#8217;s a whole different ball game. This type of boss views his or her employees as peers (or pals) and treats them as such, which crosses all sorts of boundaries. We may find it flattering at first — it feels good to have your co-worker, who is also your boss, divulge things to you that could make you feel like you&#8217;re a confidant or favorite.</p>
<p>However, as these boundaries shift and lines are blurred, you may find yourself drained by the conversations and baggage they decide to place on your &#8220;mental&#8221; desk. This is a disservice to you, can be detrimental to your mental health, and can cause us to feel anxious at work and after-hours, as though you always need to be on call and available to help them.</p>
<p>Remember, you are not your boss’s therapist. You are their employee and have not been hired to be a helpline or source of support. Your boss has people outside of the workplace for that — friends, family, hopefully a therapist. The best way to combat this sort of inappropriate boss-employee relationship is to begin to reset boundaries as the transgressions happen, letting them know that you’re not comfortable being their confidant.</p>
<p>Navigating your boss-employee relationship can be a tricky thing. It&#8217;s always tricky to reset boundaries with anyone in a position of power or authority in any work environment, but it is essential nonetheless. As you establish limits in the workplace, you will see a positive change in your mental health with your career, impacting other areas of your mental health journey and your life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s no wonder that work stresses so many of us out. Americans work longer hours with less vacation time<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=93364&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> than anyone in the developed world</a>. This can make it difficult to balance work life with family life, friendships, and your own emotional and physical self-care.</p>
<p>For some of us, this stress can take a real toll on our performance at work, and when stress reaches a breaking point, some of us are apt to “lose it” — perhaps lashing out at colleagues, acting unreasonably, or losing our tempers.</p>
<p><span id="more-10527"></span></p>
<p>While this behavior is regrettable, it is important to have some self-compassion. Many times, people “lose it” at work because of factors that are beyond their control, explains says Talkspace therapist Jill Daino, LCSW from New York.</p>
<p>“Being under <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/5-therapist-approved-ways-de-stress-day/" target="_blank">unreasonable stress </a>over a period time — working long hours, rushed deadlines, changing expectations, a verbally demeaning boss, someone else getting credit for your work — are just some examples of an environment that can lead to someone losing it,” says Daino.</p>
<p>When you combine a stressful environment like that with stresses from your personal life, this is when things can get out of hand, and your emotions are more likely to boil over and affect others, Daino explains.</p>
<h2>What To Do After You’ve “Lost It” At Work</h2>
<p>The good news is there are things you can do to do repair the damage after you’ve lost your cool at work. And you might find that with a little effort, your work relationship will actually become stronger in the end. We caught up with a few <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/08/the-different-types-of-therapists-and-counselors-the-complete-guide/">Talkspace therapists </a>to discuss some possible strategies.</p>
<h3>1. Acknowledge your mistake, and then move on.</h3>
<p>After a “cooling off” period, it’s important to try to find a way to apologize to those impacted by your behavior. This isn’t an easy thing to do, but in the end, it will make everyone involved feel a lot better, and be able to work together more cohesively.</p>
<p>Talkspace Therapist Christine Tolman, LPC from Connecticut and Idaho, recommends a clear, concise apology, but doesn’t recommend you dwell too heavily on the event.</p>
<p>“Acknowledge that you have done something wrong, apologize as appropriate, and let it go,” she suggests. “You don’t have to hang on to every wrong you have done. If you have sincerely apologized and made an effort to change your habits so it doesn’t happen again, then move on.”</p>
<h3>2. Have a direct and honest discussion with those impacted by your behavior.</h3>
<p>Rachel O’Neill, Ph.D., an Ohio-based licensed professional clinical counselor and Talkspace Therapist, recommends that you make a point of directly addressing those who you impacted — and doing so as promptly as possible.</p>
<p>“It can be tempting to try to have these conversations via text or email but, if possible, try to arrange a face-to-face meeting for your conversation,” she says. Additionally, O’Neill says that you should be mindful that the person you “lost it” at may have their own “unresolved feelings” about the event. It’s important to accept that, and not try to push their feelings aside.</p>
<h3>3. Discuss the work circumstances that have been causing you stress.</h3>
<p>Jill Daino suggests an approach that involves a more in-depth conversation with those your behavior impacted. She recommends you “sincerely and professionally express your regret” as a first step. You want to take responsibility for the stress or hurt feelings you caused.</p>
<p>At the same time, says Daino, this might be a chance to discuss the working conditions that have been stressing you out. If possible, she says, use this discussion as an “opportunity to discuss the stressors that led to ‘losing it’ so that you can learn from this experience.” In fact, doing this can be a way for you not only to repair any personal or professional relationships, but find ways for those relationships to grow.</p>

<h2>How To Prevent Yourself From “Losing It” In The First Place</h2>
<p>Obviously, you want to do what you can to ensure that you don’t “lose it” at work again. And according to the Talkspace therapists, prevention is key — and this means taking care of your mental and emotional well being before things spiral out of control. Here are some simple ways you can attend to your mental health so that you are less likely to “lose it” at work in the future.</p>
<h3>1. Engage in regular self-care.</h3>
<p>In order to make “self-care” work, you need to make it a priority in your life, and do it regularly. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/self-care-stop-stress-secrets/" target="_blank">Self-care </a>can make your emotions less volatile and can feed your soul, which increases your overall happiness and well-being.</p>
<p>“Take regular breaks, eat healthy foods, exercise if you can. Meditate at your desk. Take a walk at lunch,” suggests Christine Tolman.</p>
<h3>2. Take three slow deep breaths.</h3>
<p>It sounds like a cliché at this point to tell someone to take a deep breath. But there is science behind the fact that deep <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/03/how-you-can-beat-anxiety-with-mindful-breathing/">breathing</a> can mitigate the “fight or flight” hormones that course through your body when angry or on edge.</p>
<p>“Taking 3 slow deep breaths, in through your nose and out through your mouth, can slow your pulse enough to allow you to take control of your emotions,” explains Tolman.</p>
<h3>3. Take a step back, and remove yourself from the situation if possible.</h3>
<p>Another option during the heat of the moment is simply to take a step back when you find yourself starting to “lose it” — maybe even a literal step out of the room.</p>
<p>Jill Daino recommends counting to 10 before you speak, and taking a deep breath during this pause. Then, if it’s possible, excuse yourself to the bathroom or another room — perhaps with a trusted friend who can listen to your concerns. This “break” can help tremendously.</p>
<p>“The goal is to create a pause for you to mentally gather yourself so that instead of ‘losing it’ you can handle the situation in a more effective manner,” Diano says.</p>
<h3>4. Practice mindful emotional awareness.</h3>
<p>Rachel O’Neill recommend having regular “check-ins” with yourself throughout your work day. By practicing <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/mindfulness-therapy-improve-mental-health/">mindfulness</a>, you can ask yourself some key questions, like: “Do you notice any stress within your body? Do you have a headache? Do you appear to be overly tense?”</p>
<p>If the answer to these questions is yes, this might be a cue that you are starting to experience a higher level of stress and that it’s time to take a pause. “This could be a good time to take a brief 2-5 minute break, do some deep breathing exercises, get up and walk around, or remove yourself from the stress-producing event, to the extent possible,” says O’Neill.</p>
<p>None of us wants to “lose it” at work — but it happens — and is more common than you might think. And while “losing it” is never the answer, sometimes it can be used as an opportunity to become more honest with ourselves and others about what is stressing us out — and this can be a positive first step toward real change.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Losing a job — or even leaving one voluntarily — can take a huge toll on your mental health. First and foremost is the stress and worry about how you will stay afloat financially. Your daily routine also gets thrown off, and your self-esteem and identity might take a hit as well. And if you have family or a spouse to support, it can be easy to fall into the trap of guilt and shame over the inability to provide income in the short-term.</p>
<p>Unemployment means living with an uncertain future, and this alone can trigger depression and anxiety in many of us. But you should know that almost all of us have been there at one time or another, and you are not alone. Most importantly, there are actionable things you can do to protect your mental health.</p>
<p><span id="more-10452"></span></p>
<h2>Considering Your Mental Health During a Difficult Time</h2>
<p>Remember: If your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/mental-health-counselor/" target="_blank">mental health</a> is at risk, you will not be able to pursue employment opportunities with vigor and confidence. It’s vital that you do what you can to nurture your emotional well-being at this time.</p>
<p>“Feelings of uncertainty are a difficult part of being unemployed, but the key is to control what you can control and let go of the rest,” says Amanda Rausch, a LMFT in Washington state. Rausch recommends that you be proactive in whatever way that you can, but also keep in mind that however difficult this period in your life is, it’s temporary.</p>
<p>“The law of impermanence is currently working in your favor and the only certainty you can truly rely on is uncertainty,” Rausch says.</p>
<h2>Unemployment Allows You to Redefine Yourself</h2>
<p>One of the things to be mindful of is how unemployment might be causing self-esteem issues for you, especially since people often <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/how-staying-in-a-job-you-hate-affects-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">define themselves by their jobs</a>. Rausch suggests trying to find ways to redefine your identity, and to look for ways to keep your outlook positive and empowering.</p>
<p>“Define yourself by traits, not titles,” Rausch advises. “For example, a businessman is not defined by the title he receives at work, but the traits that got him that title are what build his self esteem (organized, responsible, honest, driven). Titles are fleeting, but traits cannot be taken away from you.”</p>
<p>Additionally, says Rausch, try not to let unemployment itself define who you are. “How you make the most of your time between jobs is within your control,” she assures.</p>
<p><a href="https://courses.talkspace.com/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_MID&amp;utr_content=affordable&amp;utr_adgroup=midpost-cta&amp;WPpost_id=10823&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/mental-health-while-unemployed-ways-to-support/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4880 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/e-course-blog-cta.png" alt="talkspace guide to overcoming stress at work CTA" width="660" height="240" /></a></p>
<h2>Ways to Maintain Mental Health While Unemployed</h2>
<p>Rausch has some other fantastic tips for maintaining your mental health <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/12/9-tips-managing-gaps-resume-due-mental-illness/" target="_blank">while unemployed</a>.</p>
<h3>1. Make Daily Task Lists</h3>
<p>Make actionable lists of what you can do each day to secure future work, like tuning up your resume, contacting recruiters, browsing job postings, and pinging friends and former colleagues who might be able to help.</p>
<p>“Dedicate a set amount of time to [the employment search] each day,” says Rausch. But, once that dedicated time is over, let it go for a bit. “Redirect your mind and focus until the next designated time,” she says.</p>
<h3>2. Dedicate Time to Things You Enjoy</h3>
<p>Make lists of things that you didn’t have to time to do when you were working, and dedicate some time to those too. This way, you can make the most of your new-found free time, Rausch suggests.</p>
<p>You shouldn’t feel guilty about taking care of important personal business, starting a new hobby, or spending time with friends you haven’t seen for a while. Your life is yours, and you can use this time to fulfill the emotional and practical needs that may have been neglected while you were employed.</p>
<h3>3. Practice Self-Care</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/when-self-care-becomes-problematic/" target="_blank">Self-care</a> is more important now than ever, explains Rausch. But practicing self-care doesn’t have to cost extra money that you may be wary of spending right now.</p>
<p>“Taking bubble baths, organizing your home, taking walks, and remembering to breathe all help maintain mental health,” says Rausch.</p>
<h3>4. Seek Support</h3>
<p>Most importantly, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/how-to-ask-for-help-mental-health-care/" target="_blank">get support</a>. Begin — or keep going — to therapy, if at all possible. And don’t forget the helpers who are already in your life, many of whom would love to support you if you’d reach out and tell them what’s going on.</p>
<p>“Do not isolate,” Rausch says. “Reach out to those who support you. Know you are not alone.”</p>
<h2>You’re Not Alone, and Everything Will Work Out</h2>
<p>It’s easy to feel that you are the only one facing the stressors that periods of unemployment present. But you definitely are not alone. You may feel that there is very little that you can control right now, but the fact is there is a lot you <i>can</i> do — both to secure a new job, and protect your mental health in the process.</p>
<p>Everything <i>will </i>work out as it should in the end, so have a little faith, take an extra bubble bath (or three: who’s counting?), and hang in there. The best is yet to come.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Studies show it, anecdotes illustrate it, and entire movements are built around it: When it comes to professional and even personal success, historically marginalized people — women, racial minorities, sexual minorities, people with disabilities, and others — are judged negatively for their strengths.</p>
<p>Whether it’s women <a href="https://www.salon.com/2018/03/26/are-smart-women-scary-study-suggests-women-are-punished-for-academic-success-with-lower-pay/" target="_blank">being punished</a> for academic success or people of color <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/9/18/16307782/study-racism-jobs" target="_blank">being judged less competent</a> than their less-qualified white peers, discrimination continues to hamper us, from the classroom to the boardroom.</p>
<p><span id="more-9516"></span></p>
<p>With so many people around us <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/10/06/inclusion-diversity-employers-race/" target="_blank">questioning our worth</a>, it can be hard for women and historically marginalized people to maintain confidence in ourselves, even though we work our butts off and <i>know </i>we’re just as capable as the “good ol’ boys.” This, in turn, can lead to imposter syndrome: The persistent feeling that we don’t really deserve our success or that we’re just “faking it.”</p>
<h2>What is Imposter Syndrome?</h2>
<p>Imposter syndrome <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_ladder/2016/04/is_impostor_syndrome_real_and_does_it_affect_women_more_than_men.html" target="_blank">isn’t an actual psychological diagnosis</a>, it’s more a pattern of thinking. And it’s not just women and marginalized people who feel like frauds: People from every demographic suffer from imposter syndrome.</p>
<p>But for women and historically marginalized people, imposter syndrome can be <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/11/05/imposter_effect_women_feel_like_frauds_at_work_because_they_are_high_achieving.html" target="_blank">particularly lethal</a>, amplifying discriminatory messages we continue to receive in the workplace: subtle, daily reminders that others consider us “less-than” or that our accomplishments aren’t really ours.</p>
<p>Having others doubt our abilities to the point that we doubt ourselves can really do a number on our mental health, lowering self-confidence and hampering professional success. It’s truly unfair that marginalized people in particular have to deal with a history of discrimination that isn’t our fault. While it’s not our responsibility to change the world, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/02/self-awareness-will-make-your-life-better-heres-how-to-get-it/" target="_blank">we <i>can</i> change how we value ourselves</a>. And by kicking our own imposter syndrome to the curb, we can level the playing field for others.</p>
<p>Fighting imposter syndrome starts by recognizing that negative self-evaluations just aren’t true, and flipping that script to turn our perceived weaknesses into strengths. Next time you’re plagued with self-doubt, here are a few tips.</p>
<h2>It’s not you</h2>
<p>Let’s get one thing straight: Imposter syndrome isn’t just a personal problem. It’s an historic result of who gets to be in power and define success, based on categories like gender, race, sexuality, and ability.</p>
<p>People from groups who have historically dominated your field may doubt themselves, but they don’t have their abilities questioned in the same way women and minorities do. They can move more fluently through the workplace, academic, or political environments, because it was built primarily with them in mind. They don’t face the same kind of <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3031101/the-new-subtle-sexism-toward-women-in-the-workplace" target="_blank">daily discrimination</a> you might.</p>
<p>Next time you feel self-doubt wiggling in, remind yourself: The problem. Is. Not. You.</p>
<h2>Flip the script</h2>
<p>Whenever you feel that your gender, race, sexuality, ability, or other permanent characteristic make you less worthy of your position compared to the “big guys” — and yes, they normally <i>are</i> guys — remind yourself: You <i>deserve</i> to be here.</p>
<p>You are a person with inherent value and worth because you worked your butt off to achieve success <i>and </i>overcome obstacles on the way. Not only have you conquered the normal obstacles that everyone faces to get ahead in their education and field, you’ve also had to demonstrate the grit, determination, and competence to get ahead in a field where the barriers to entry may be high.</p>
<p>This is an asset, not a hindrance. It gives you insights and perspective people who come from more “conventional” backgrounds simply wouldn’t think of. Your difference isn’t your drawback: It’s your secret superpower.</p>
<h2>Team up</h2>
<p>One tricky problem women and racially marginalized people often face in the workplace is that we can be <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/10/being-black-work/409990/" target="_blank">punished or censored </a>for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2015/dec/03/why-the-angry-black-woman-cliche-has-no-place-at-work" target="_blank">speaking up and claiming space</a>, while men and people from a majority group may be rewarded. This can create a ton of anxiety, as we navigate the tricky balance between asserting ourselves but not wanting to appear “too” assertive. While it’s frustrating and definitely unfair, remind yourself (again and again and again) that you know what you’re talking about, and can find allies in your workplace who will back you up.</p>
<p>Get in touch with a prospective mentor who may have had a similar experience to yours. Team up with a workplace peer, or offer to help out someone just starting out. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/how-to-know-if-a-company-will-be-a-good-place-for-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">Finding allies for mutual support</a> will not only encourage your confidence, it will boost each of you up, giving others around you models of success. Plan together so you can support each other’s ideas at key meetings, and give each other genuine compliments and loving criticism.</p>
<p>An ally in the struggle can help reflect a more realistic self-image back at you, when everyone else may be giving you a distorted one.</p>
<h2>Pass it on</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, the imposter syndrome we feel as women and marginalized people isn’t just an individual problem, it’s a reflection of what kind of environments we study and work in. When we think of our imposter syndrome as a collective problem and not an individual one, we can take the blame off ourselves. And while the tendency for women and minorities to be the <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/news-flash-women-are-sick-of-being-the-office-mom" target="_blank">go-to people</a> in the office for “<a href="https://business.vanderbilt.edu/news/2018/02/26/tokenism-in-the-workplace/" target="_blank">diversity</a>” is exhausting and unfair, lifting up other women and marginalized people in the workplace not only helps them — it helps us.</p>
<p>So go ahead: <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/5-ways-improve-body-image-confidence-mental-health/" target="_blank">Love yourself</a>. Remind yourself of the fight you’ve put up to get where you are. Compliment your own work. Remember that your differences are strengths. When you quash that voice inside you that says you’re not good enough, and let yourself shine, you give others permission to embrace yourselves for what you are. The real deal.</p>

<p>Every boss has his or her moments when grumpiness or a negative attitude takes hold, causing them to lash out. Our superiors are human, after all, and they are entitled to bad days just like anyone else.</p>
<p>But have you ever worked for someone who seemed to constantly run hot and cold: charming and funny one second, then vicious and manipulative the next? If a power-wielding bully dominates your workplace, you could very likely be working for a psychopath.<span id="more-66145"></span></p>
<p><span id="more-9393"></span></p>
<p>You probably spend a great majority of your life at the office, and if just one psychopath inhabits your workplace, it can mean a very confusing and uncomfortable situation. People that work for psychopaths are subject to more bullying and stress, and the organizations that employ them are riddled with conflict, high turnover, reduced <a class="recomendedHyperlink" href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/how-to-be-productive-at-work-9-ideas-for-tackling-your-to-do-list-in-less-time" target="_blank">productivity</a>, and absenteeism.</p>
<p>If psychopaths are so toxic, why do companies hire them in the first place?</p>
<p>Psychopaths woo with their persuasive charm, charisma, intelligence, and risk-taking nature. On paper these qualities paint the profile of an ideal CEO.</p>
<p>While these bombastic personalities can lurk in any office environment, psychopaths are particularly drawn to high-powered, fast-paced careers such as lawyers, salespeople, journalists, media personalities, police officers, and business executives. In fact, <a href="https://www.inc.com/steve-blakeman/5-signs-that-your-boss-might-actually-be-a-psychop.html" target="_blank">recent studies</a> find the rate of psychopathy among corporate professionals is 1 in 5 or 21 percent.</p>
<p>While the social ruthlessness of psychopaths may help them quickly ascend the corporate ladder, their reign can be very demoralizing for staff that end up terrified to face their boss every day.</p>
<p>So how do you know if you’re working for or with a psychopath? What are the signs and symptoms to watch out for?</p>
<p><strong>1. They are charming.</strong></p>
<p>Psychopaths are known to be extremely charming upon first impression. When they meet someone for the first time they come off as friendly and charismatic, the exact type of person that everyone likes to be around. While initially you have may been excited to work for such a strong leader, over time you’ve seen their charm wear off. They now make you constantly feel as if you’ve done something wrong. You may be stuck in a <a href="https://melodywilding.com/5-ways-not-to-handle-criticism-and-what-to-do-instead/" target="_blank">cycle of self-doubt</a> and insecurity, feeling like you need to get back on your boss’s good side.</p>
<p><strong>2. They are control freaks.</strong></p>
<p>If you feel like your every move is being tracked and micromanaged, it probably is. Psychopathic bosses do everything they can to keep others in an <a href="https://melodywilding.com/6-ways-you-can-stop-being-a-people-pleaser-that-dont-involve-shouting-no/" target="_blank">inferior, weak position</a>, often stripping employees of any decision-making power. For example, your boss may tie your hands by requesting you get direct approval from him to move forward on the tiniest aspects of projects, or risk his rage and punishment.</p>
<p><strong>3. They are narcissists.</strong></p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, psychopaths are not devoid of emotion — rather, self-serving emotions (not prosocial ones) drive them. They feign concern for others, appearing helpful and compassionate, only to exploit you later. Self-absorbed and arrogant, a psychopathic boss believes undoubtedly that they are the team’s critical linchpin — all others are disposable. This is seen when they callously trash friendships or working relationships, and fire people without any good reason.</p>
<p><strong>4. They are masters of deception.</strong></p>
<p>Psychopaths operate from a warped moral code and experience little to no guilt or remorse over telling lies. These bosses are skilled at <a href="https://melodywilding.com/4-times-you-should-say-no-to-additional-responsibilities-at-work/" target="_blank">avoiding accountability</a> and have a Teflon-like capability to deflect blame. They lie, omit information, rephrase the truth, and misrepresent facts. They take credit for ideas that they did not come up with.</p>
<p><strong>5. They avoid responsibility.</strong></p>
<p>Psychopaths have an overblown sense of entitlement. They often cast themselves in the role of victims, clearing themselves of any liability. They never take responsibility for wrongdoing and can easily shift the blame to others and keep their reputation unsullied. Because psychopaths are adept at manufacturing evidence that points the finger at someone else, they make excellent attorneys.</p>
<p><strong>6. They take extreme risks.</strong></p>
<p>These people move at lightspeed without any consideration for the consequences. Research shows that high-risk behaviors more intensely trigger reward areas in the brains of psychopaths than in the normal population, meaning the thrill of danger far outweighs <a href="https://melodywilding.com/how-to-up-your-tolerance-for-ambiguity-and-future-proof-your-career/" target="_blank">practical considerations</a> and safety. While this impulse helps psychopaths perform under pressure and makes them particularly suited for high-stress <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/jobs" target="_blank">jobs</a>, it comes at the cost of making unwise investments, and taking illegal shortcuts to get their way.</p>
<p>If you find that your boss does resemble many of these signs and symptoms of psychopathology, it may be time for you to assess your situation. If it isn’t possible for you to change jobs (or move to a different department in your current job), educate yourself on psychopathy so you can anticipate your boss’s manipulative behavior.</p>
