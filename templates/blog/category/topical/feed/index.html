				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to Thanksgiving traditions, my family does not hold back. From our morning brunch, to afternoon disc golf, to folding napkins into turkeys set around the dinner table, we love our annual traditions.</p>
<p>Last year we tried something new. We wrote notes to each present family member with what we appreciate about them and took turns reading the notes aloud. There were laughs, there were tears, and most of all, there was a deep sense of gratitude. This may be our best tradition yet.<span id="more-11348"></span></p>
<h2>The Story Behind Gratitude</h2>
<p>The concept of gratitude has captivated the hearts and minds of philosophers and spiritual teachers for centuries. From Cicero, to the Buddha, to Adam Smith, gratitude was thought to be essential to individual and societal well-being.</p>
<p>These ancient philosophers were onto something because <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11316013" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">recent scientific studies</a> suggest gratitude is <a href="&quot;https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/4-mental-health-benefits-of-gratitude-to-keep-in-mind-this-thanksgiving/“" target="”_blank”">good for our health</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11316013" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">good for society</a>. Studies suggest grateful people are <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/sbp/sbp/2003/00000031/00000005/art00001" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">happier</a>, <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-13991-003" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">healthier</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399908004224" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">more well-rested</a>, <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-01140-012" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">more motivated to exercise</a>, and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1475-6811.2010.01273.x" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">have stronger relationships</a>. Let’s dive into why.</p>
<p>Here are six key insights about gratitude and our brains, according to science:</p>
<h2>1. Gratitude Makes Us Feel More Connected</h2>
<p>Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4588123/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">neuroscientists can see</a> that the same regions of the brain associated with socialization and pleasure light up when someone experiences gratitude. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/4-mental-health-benefits-of-gratitude-to-keep-in-mind-this-thanksgiving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gratitude</a> can even impact arousal levels. This may explain why gratitude plays such an important role in relationships.</p>
<p>“When we are truly grateful, we tend to look for ways to demonstrate it, along with love or affection,” said Cynthia Catchings, LCSW-S, MSSW, CFPT, a Virginia-based licensed Talkspace therapist. “We also have to remember the law of attraction,” Catchings added. “When we are grateful, we invite the universe to manifest more of what we like, need, or enjoy.”</p>
<p><b>Try this</b>: Tell someone you love three things you appreciate most about them.</p>
<h2>2. Grateful People Are More Generous</h2>
<p>Neuroscientists <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811915011532" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">found</a> that grateful people show greater neural sensitivity in the medial prefrontal cortex (the area of the brain associated with learning and decision-making). These findings suggest the more grateful a person feels, the more they will express gratitude.</p>
<p>This may shed light into what psychologist Paul Piff and his colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley, <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-14101-001" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">discovered</a> about how the most generous people are not necessarily the most wealthiest.</p>
<p><b>Try this</b>: Research a new charity to support, organization to volunteer at, or offer a smile to a stranger.</p>
<h2>3. Gratitude Comes From The Heart</h2>
<p>Neuroscientists <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811915011532" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">studied</a> the motivation behind gratitude and found that people who donated to a cause did not do so because they felt they “should.” Rather, research suggests grateful people are motivated to do something nice out of the goodness of their heart. When it comes to teaching children about gratitude, Catchings suggests journaling and drawing as helpful ways to demonstrate gratitude and observe feelings and behaviors.</p>
<p>“We can teach our <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/childrens-mental-health-worry-take-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">children</a> to be mindful of their emotions and use positive thoughts that lead them to being grateful,” Catchings said, “When children learn to think while being aware of who or what makes positive aspects in their lives&#8230;they learn to appreciate what is given to them and what they have instead of concentrating on what they do not have.”</p>
<p><b>Try this:</b> Write an old-fashioned thank you note.</p>
<h2>4. Gratitude Can Be Learned</h2>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/have-you-heard-of-neurocounseling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neuroplasticity</a> (our brain’s ability to constantly create new neural pathways), we have the power to train our brains to seek out moments of gratitude. This is good news for anyone who was worried they would be stuck in a glass-half-empty mentality forever. With conscious practice, you have the ability to rewire your brain. Instead of defaulting to what’s not working, you can focus on what is.</p>
<p><b>Try this</b>: As soon as you wake up, write down one thing you are excited about for the day.</p>
<h2>5. Gratitude Relieves Stress</h2>
<p>Cultivating gratitude through practices such as meditation has been shown to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28698643" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reduce heart rate</a>. These findings suggest that paying attention to what you are grateful for can not only help you cope with daily stressors but can also lead to a longer, healthier life.</p>
<p>Many therapists, including Cynthia Catchings, have reported the loving-kindness <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/meditation-science-eases-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meditation</a> as particularly effective in evoking feelings of gratitude. As Catchings said, “loving-kindness meditation, also known as metta meditation, teaches us that by practicing it, we first learn to love ourselves unconditionally and then we learn how to extend that unconditional love to everyone around us.”</p>
<p>“People with self-esteem issues or survivors of domestic abuse benefit the most from metta meditation,” she continued, “but at the end, it can help everyone, since we can learn how to more deeply feel true self-compassion.”</p>
<p><b>Try this</b>: Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and think about the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>One thing you appreciate about yourself</li>
<li>One thing you appreciate about a loved one</li>
<li>One thing you appreciate about someone you don’t know very well</li>
</ol>
<h2>6. Gratitude Is Not The Magic Bullet</h2>
<p>There are times when gratitude may not be appropriate.</p>
<p>“Gratitude might not be appropriate when it is inauthentic,” Catchings said, “When we are dealing with abuse, trauma, or death expressing gratitude can be taken as inadequate or false.”</p>
<p>Instead, a <a href="http://www.talkspace.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">therapist</a> might utilize mindfulness if a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/09/different-types-therapy-psychotherapy-best/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">positive-oriented approach</a> like gratitude does not feel beneficial.</p>
<p>Personally, when I was going through a traumatic experience, it made me feel worse to hear the advice “you just need to focus on the positive” or “you need to find the lesson in all of this.” I found it comforting to learn that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11811629" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">research tells us </a>being a grateful person does not mean you are happy all the time. Rather, grateful people may be more accepting of the entirety of their emotional experience.</p>
<p><b>Try this:</b> Think about one person (including yourself) who has showed up to support you through a difficult experience and tell them how much it means to you.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it’s not about how consistently you write in your gratitude journal or how many minutes you meditate on gratitude each morning.</p>
<p>Gratitude is about noticing the little moments. It’s about appreciating the people around you. It’s about remembering the power of two simple words: thank you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We can all agree that being a teenager has always been tough. Hormones are changing, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/10-signs-social-anxiety-according-therapist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social anxiety</a> has kicked into high gear, and peer pressure is exerting itself from every angle.</p>
<p>But teens today are facing unique challenges. From <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/managing-social-media-intake-without-quitting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media addiction</a> to social isolation, vaping to the opioid epidemic, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/7-ways-to-deal-with-cyberbullying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cyberbullying</a> to gun violence, Gen Z-ers are coming of age in a whole new world. Most concerning, it’s showing up in their mental health.</p>
<p><span id="more-11321"></span></p>
<p>While today’s teens are the most “connected” generation, research also shows that they’re the loneliest. From 2000 to 2015, the percentage of teens who <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">hang out with their friends almost every day has decreased by over 40 percent</a>. In fact, it’s been discovered that loneliness is <a href="https://www.webmd.com/balance/news/20180504/loneliness-rivals-obesity-smoking-as-health-risk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">as dangerous as smoking 15 cigarettes a day</a>, making it more lethal than the obesity epidemic.</p>
<p>But what makes the mental health crisis for adolescents so acute? How are the problems facing today’s young people different than those facing previous generations? And most importantly: what can we do about it?</p>
<p>These were the questions we sought to answer at our 3rd annual conference <b>Mental Health and Youth: Breakdown or Breakthrough</b>.</p>
<p><iframe width="660" height="371" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dTEK1oBjipg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>The Day’s Key Topics</h2>
<p>The conference was held at the TimesCenter in New York City and featured a first look at the documentary <i>Weight of Gold</i>, with special guests world champion swimmer <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/michael" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Phelps</a> and figure skater Sasha Cohen. The conference also brought together a wide-range of panelists: clinicians from NYU, Columbia, and Harvard as well as technology thought leaders, authors and publishers, and politicians.</p>
<p>Panels included topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p1KCXWbjmU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Early Onset Adulthood</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooITARfCRU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Connected but Alone: Coming of Age in the Social Media Era</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpTXj-bvGg0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Fireside Chat: A Conversation with World Champion Swimmer, Michael Phelps</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyN8r-9iL1A" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Cyberbullying to Gun Violence: How Teens are Coping with Trauma</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_NJiRvktmc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Ready to Leave Home and Face the World</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvaS1eN7Fdw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Weight of Gold: How World-Class Athletes and High-Performance Individuals Connect To Their Mental Health</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The event also served as an opportunity to highlight the dire need of teens underserved by the mental health community. As many as <a href="https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-By-the-Numbers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">half of all lifetime mental illnesses develop by age 14</a>, but only a fraction of those kids and teens receive care.</p>
<p>With the hope of helping to mitigate it, we announced a partnership with <a href="https://giveanhour.org/talkspace-launches-new-platform-offering-affordable-mental-healthcare-for-teens-partners-with-give-an-hour/" target="”_blank”">Give an Hour</a>, a non-profit mental health organization that provides free access to care for populations that desperately need it. Together, our organizations are offering 500 months of free therapy to teens in need of behavioral health care.</p>
<h2>Announcing Talkspace for Teens</h2>
<p>And, finally, Talkspace announced that it will be providing services, with parental consent, to teens between the ages of 13-17. Now, with <a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/talkspace-for-teens">Talkspace for Teens</a>, young people can receive the benefits of professional counseling without having to divulge sensitive problems to teachers or friends.</p>
<p>Receiving mental health care will no longer necessitate leaving school early or missing activities — Talkspace for Teens provides adolescents a new kind of space online, one where they can express themselves authentically, securely, and confidentially.</p>
<p>The conference was a day to discuss some of the most pressing questions facing young people — a fascinating, deep dive into the relationships between mental health, social media, substance abuse, and gun control. Our hope is that it provided some solutions as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If these past few years of political turmoil and divisiveness in America have significantly increased your stress levels, you are far from alone. Whatever your political beliefs, the current political climate in America is so divided — and downright terrifying at times — it is completely understandable to have strong feelings about it.</p>
<p>Add in the effects of a 24-hour news cycle, and the never-ending onslaught of social media, and you have a recipe for increased mental health risk.</p>
<p><span id="more-11217"></span></p>
<h2>Statistics Related to Mental Health and Politics</h2>
<p>Those who work in the mental health field can attest to this. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Therapists</a> have seen a huge spike in mental health disorders related to politics, as well as an increase in patients looking for help. In 2017, The American Psychological Association (APA), which conducts an annual “<a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stress poll</a>” saw the largest 10 year spike in stress among Americans. Of those surveyed, 57% reported stress about the political climate; 66% about our nation’s future; and 49% about the previous presidential election.</p>
<p>Americans are losing sleep, too, according to <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/personal-finance/smart-money/money-worries-survey-august-2018/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">a poll</a> from this past summer. One in seven — or 34 million of us — are suffering from politics-related insomnia. And it’s no wonder. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/05/11/hate-crime-rates-are-still-on-the-rise/?utm_term=.7fc540dce0be" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Hate crimes </a> are at a 10 year high. Many of us are worried about being able to afford health insurance now, and for the long haul. We are terrified that our basic civil rights might be stripped at any time, that we’ll be banned or deported, and that democracy as we know it might be in the toilet.</p>
<h2>Politics Are Personal</h2>
<p>Politics is deeply personal these days. Many of us have lost friendships and or had to distance ourselves or cut ties with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/when-does-family-drama-become-toxic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">family members</a> whose beliefs offend us. Racism and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/history-hysteria-sexism-diagnosis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexism</a> — even among our loved ones — feels more out in the open now. Or, we have become more aware of it. Old and new wounds have been opened, many that feel irreparable.</p>
<p>If you, like me, already had a mental health disorder (<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/anxiety-attack-vs-panic-attack-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety and panic disorder</a> in my case), you have likely needed to practice an unduly amount of self-care just to keep everything in check. Perhaps you started therapy again. Or maybe you have needed to stay out of the political arena just to make it through your days (no shame in doing what needs to be done to stay healthy and well!).</p>
<p>First of all, let’s all let out a big, cleansing, well-deserved <i>sigh</i>. It is not your imagination: Things really have been this stressful. I have never in my lifetime felt this uncertain and terrified about my country. I know so many of you are feeling that way too. <i>Group hugs all around</i>.</p>
<h2>How Voting Supports Our Mental Health</h2>
<p>But do you know what is the antidote to feeling this desperate and beaten down? VOTING! Doing something — anything — to make your feelings about what is happening in this country known is vital. It’s not only good for the future of this country, but for your mental health.</p>
<p>Part of what feels so difficult about the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/how-we-can-heal-after-this-horrible-election-cycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political times</a> is we find ourselves disempowered and helpless. Although voting won’t necessarily fix all the problems we have, it is a chance for us to make our voices heard, and to tap into a feeling of empowerment and choice.</p>
<h2>How You Can Get Involved in Political Change</h2>
<p>Besides making sure that you get yourself to the polls or get your mail-in ballot into the mailbox ASAP, there are so many other ways you can get involved this political season.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participate in a <a href="https://postcardstovoters.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">postcard mailing campaign</a>, encouraging all your fellow Americans to vote.</li>
<li>Donate what you can to political candidates whose views align with yours. Every little bit counts.</li>
<li>Ask your friends and neighbors if they are voting.</li>
<li>Offer to drive people to the polls who have no way of getting there (or alert them to the generous folks at Lyft and Uber who are offering free rides to the election).</li>
<li>Phone bank for political candidates. You can do so for candidates outside your state.</li>
<li>Sign up to do some political canvassing in your neighborhood.</li>
</ul>
<p>If that list sounds daunting to you, remember that you don’t have to do all, or any of these. But you might find that just doing one or two items spread out over the next week will feel really good. Again, just taking action, big or small, is an incredibly healing gesture, and will do wonders for your wellbeing.</p>
<p>Most of all, <i>vote</i>. Tuesday November 6th, rain or shine. <a href="http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/vote18" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Do the research</a> to find the candidates and initiatives committed to protecting and expanding your access to mental healthcare. Vote like your mental health depends on it. Because it does.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is <b>World Mental Health Day</b>, an opportunity for organizations and individuals around the globe to bring awareness to mental health and surrounding challenges.</p>
<p>Each year, the <a href="https://wfmh.global/">World Federation For Mental Health</a> (WFMH) selects a theme that facilitates discussion around a growing mental health epidemic or challenge. This year’s theme is “<strong>Young People and Mental Health in a Changing World</strong>.”</p>
<p><span id="more-11092"></span></p>
<p>As youth worldwide find themselves increasingly exposed to new methods of communication, unreal expectations from social networks, and unhealthy societal pressures as they approach full adulthood, it’s important we examine the problems new generations face.</p>
<p>Below are a few mental health challenges youth are facing around the globe, and how we all can help.</p>
<h2>Mental Illness Begins Young</h2>
<p>According to WHO, <a href="http://www.who.int/mental_health/world-mental-health-day/2018/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">half of all mental illness begins by the age of fourteen</a>. Recognizing the age at which mental illness begins is an important first step, but currently, mental illness often goes undiagnosed or untreated in this age range.</p>
<p>Youth are also susceptible to an increased suicide risk. Among 15-29-year-olds, it’s the second leading cause of death. Bullying or harassment online is increasingly common, with <a href="https://www.stopbullying.gov/cyberbullying/what-is-it/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">15% of high school students reporting they were bullied electronically</a> in 2017. Bullying leads to feelings of exclusion and rejection, which in turn lead to depression and anxiety. It’s this path that puts youth at greater risk for suicidal behavior.</p>
<p>An inability to cope with pressures from high academic expectations, entry into the workforce and its related stresses, and unstable political climates can all lead to situational substance abuse by youth. Thankfully, substance abuse overall has <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/facts-and-stats/national-and-state-data-sheets/adolescents-and-substance-abuse/united-states/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">decreased in high school students</a>.</p>
<p>Increased use of social media among younger generations leads to negative self and body image issues. These issues manifest themselves in depression and eating disorders. Instances of eating disorders among youth are <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/eating-disorders.shtml#part_155059" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">double that of adults</a>.</p>
<p>While psychotherapy and/or medication are effective solutions for working through mental illness, it’s important we also promote healthy coping behaviors in younger generations.</p>
<h2>Teaching Youth How to Cope with Tough Issues</h2>
<p>Teaching young people <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/5-therapist-approved-ways-de-stress-day/">how to combat stress</a>, and effectively manage symptoms of mental illness, leads them toward healthier, more productive lives. This has wide-ranging benefits for our societies, such as creating a happier workforce and more community-oriented individuals.</p>
<p>Concepts such as <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/self-care-stop-stress-secrets/">self-care</a> and other coping strategies are often practiced by adults, who have resources and support networks to seek help outside of traditional medical solutions. It’s important we pass these practices onto younger generations through open discussion and by sharing resources that will help them manage their <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/stress/">stress</a> and health.</p>
<p>Common examples of effective self-treatment are <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/5-ways-exercise-is-great-for-your-mental-health/">regular exercise</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/meditation-science-eases-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meditation and mindfulness practice</a>, taking <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/12-best-ways-spend-mental-health-day-according-therapist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health days</a>, and journaling. Tools like these mitigate the effects of stress and illness, and should be practiced in conjunction with therapeutic and medical solutions, if necessary.</p>
<h2>Prevention Starts at a Societal Level</h2>
<p>As global and local societies, we should do our best to stay in front of mental health risks. <a href="https://adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statistics" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Depression and anxiety disorders are reaching epidemic proportions</a>, and the effects these diagnoses have on adults trickle down to younger generations.</p>
<p>The earlier youth are exposed to healthy conversation around mental health, and provided with outlets to manage their own, the better they’ll be able to cope with issues going forward. Knowing <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/how-to-ask-for-help-mental-health-care/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">where to seek help</a>, and how to manage symptoms and stresses after diagnosis is critical to personal growth and recovery.</p>
<p>This means more resources and stigma-fighting conversations in schools. Workplaces should be prepared to help a younger workforce manage inevitable stresses. Governments should continue to provide funding to critical mental health advocacy programs and affordable health-care solutions.</p>
<p>When it comes to therapeutic options, we should teach younger generations <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/10/how-to-find-a-therapist-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to select a therapist</a> who is right for their needs, how to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/10/what-i-wish-someone-had-told-me-about-how-therapy-actually-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">communicate their issues</a> effectively, and to ensure they’re not alone in their desire to seek therapy.</p>
<h2>World Mental Health Day Is Every Day at Talkspace</h2>
<p>Treat every day as if it’s World Mental Health Day. While we’ve done incredible work to break down stigma around mental health as a society, there’s still much work to be done.</p>
<p>We should stand together each and every day to support those who are working through mental health challenges. Be there for someone if they’re struggling. Have a frank conversation with a younger person about what they’re feeling, and how you can help them. If you’re <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/09/suicide-risk-worried-about-friends-help/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concerned someone is a suicidal risk</a>, approach that person with strength but compassion.</p>
<p>Often, a simple conversation with someone you care about can save their life. Let’s continue to have those conversations together every day.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While talking about mental health, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a>, and mental illness is still relatively taboo, there are some incredible trailblazers out there who are helping to break the stigma. The more we speak up about these topics, the less taboo they become. What better way to openly talk about mental health to a large audience than through a podcast?</p>
<p>Here are 11 examples of mental health-related podcasts that are informative <em>and</em> entertaining!</p>
<p><span id="more-10010"></span></p>
<h2>Talkspace&#8217;s 2018 Mental Health Podcast List</h2>
<h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/hilarious-world-depression/id1181589175?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Hilarious World of Depression</a></h3>
<p>Mental illness is no laughing matter, but sometimes we need to take a step back from our problems and be able to have a good sense of humor about them. So if you’re already at that point, or trying to reach it, check this one out! It features actors and comedians who struggle with depression — and still find time to laugh.</p>
<h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/terrible-thanks-for-asking/id1126119288?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Terrible, Thanks For Asking</a></h3>
<p>I <i>haaate</i> when people ask, “How are you?” and don’t really care about the response. Such is small talk. I always feel like I’m obligated to say “Good, thanks,” even though what I really want to say is the title of this podcast: “<i>Terrible, thanks for asking!</i>” Host Nora McInerny urges listeners to be honest and unashamed of their struggles. I’m on board.</p>
<h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/happier-with-gretchen-rubin/id969519520?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Happier Podcast</a></h3>
<p>Happiness seems elusive, or at least fleeting, to many (namely, me). Happier Podcast by Gretchen Rubin, New York Times best selling author (who, by the way, has been interviewed by Oprah so you know she’s the real deal) strives to make your life a little bit happier, in simple and realistic steps. Go on, try it out!</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.foundationsrecoverynetwork.com/recovery-unscripted-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Recovery Unscripted</a></h3>
<p class="p1">There isn’t really a roadmap for sobriety — well, there are a few, but that doesn’t mean the path is always easy or straight. Recovery Unscripted brings fresh perspectives from inside the world of addiction and mental health recovery. Hosted by David Condos (also a great musician!) and powered by the Foundations Recovery Network, the podcast’s mission is to educate and inspire by sharing valuable addiction insights and powerful recovery stories.</p>
<p class="p1">Each episode features candid conversations with influential figures, from authors and clinicians to executives and leaders within the recovery community. Guests openly share personal recovery journeys and firsthand experiences, and listeners can join the discussion too!</p>
<h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/meditation-minis-podcast/id963597166?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Meditation Minis Podcast</a></h3>
<p>This is the podcast for you if you’re looking to try out meditation for its wide variety of mental health benefits but don’t know where to start&#8230;or don’t have the time! Most episodes are right around 10 minutes long, making meditation doable for even the busiest of bees.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-hardcore-self-help-podcast/id1094120819?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Hardcore Self Help Podcast</a></h3>
<p>I mean, who doesn’t need some hardcore self help once in a while? This one’s hosted by Robert Duff, Ph.D. who answers listeners mental health questions “WITHOUT psychobabble BS.” He aims to talk to listeners as if he was talking to friends, not just a bunch of internet strangers. In recent episodes, some topics that’ve been covered are <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/what-is-quiet-borderline-personality-disorder/" target="_blank">borderline personality disorder</a>, bipolar depression, and perfectionism.</p>
<h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/not-another-anxiety-show-learn-about-anxiety-panic/id1175495815?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Not Another Anxiety Show</a></h3>
<p>This one not only discusses anxiety and panic attacks, but it also provides some relaxation tools like deep breathing exercises or meditations. It’s both educational and motivational because it will inspire you to take steps outlined by host Kelli Walker, who is a registered nurse and certified health and wellness coach. She’s a former agoraphobe, so she has experience and success with overcoming anxiety herself. If she can do it, so can you!</p>
<h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/anxiety-slayer/id348096293?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anxiety Slayer</a></h3>
<p>This podcast sounds like the name of a superhero — and I love it! Sometimes, to conquer anxiety, it does feel like you need super powers. The podcast will give you tools to relax and reduce anxiety. It’s hosted by Ananga Sivyer and Shann Vander Leek who are authors and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/different-types-anxiety-disorders-classified/" target="_blank">anxiety</a> coaches — not to mention, award winning podcasters.</p>

Her podcast is an extension of this, and her goal is to make listeners know they aren’t alone.</p>
<h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/tiny-leaps-big-changes-motivation-inspiration-personal/id1071032154" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tiny Leaps, Big Changes</a></h3>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With every mass shooting, commentary about mental health is quick to follow — the mental health community starts bracing itself as soon as the first panicked tweet from someone on scene hits the internet. “Only a madman would do something like this.” “This is insane!” “Why can’t we stop these crazy gunmen?”</p>
<p>Today, at a Santa Fe, Texas high school, at least ten have been killed with numerous other casualties reported. This most recent mass shooting incident, the 22nd in the United States in 2018, shows how unfortunately common these events have become in modern American society.</p>
<p><span id="more-9869"></span></p>
<p>These events tend to be followed by attitudes about policy that shape the world we live in. At a time when mental health services are subject to growing cuts and it’s extremely difficult for people to access the care they need, people propose expansions to mandatory commitment laws, forcible medication legislation, registries, and more. All to protect us from “crazy gunmen.”</p>
<p>The facts don’t really support the insistence that mentally ill people are to blame for the epidemic of gun violence in the United States. People with mental health conditions are actually <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318286/" target="_blank">less likely to commit gun violence</a>, and are responsible for <a href="http://files.www.cmhnetwork.org/news/Mass_Murder_Mental_Illness_and_Men.pdf" target="_blank">comparatively few mass shootings</a> (which make up a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2013/02/mass_shootings_2009-13_-_jan_29_12pm1.pdf" target="_blank">tiny fraction of gun deaths</a>). The biggest predicator for engaging in gun violence directed at other people, whether in a mass shooting or otherwise, is a <a href="http://everytownresearch.org/" target="_blank">history of intimate partner and family violence</a>.</p>
<h2>Discussing the Facts About Guns and Mental Illness</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.bradycampaign.org/sites/default/files/TruthAboutSuicideGuns.pdf" target="_blank">Two thirds of the gun deaths</a> in America every year are suicides. Some are committed with guns people managed to obtain after zero waiting periods and with limited background checks. Others — especially among youth — involve improperly stored and secured guns left in a location accessible to someone in crisis.</p>
<p>Simply pointing to suicide statistics and saying they justify some sort of “exclusion list” for mentally ill gun buyers isn’t a solution. Who defines mental illness? Who determines who should be deemed “too unsafe” to own guns? Who can access this database? How is it updated? How do people appeal if they feel they’ve been unfairly listed? What if someone was suicidal, but got treatment and is doing well now?</p>
<p>These two facts — mentally ill people aren’t to blame for mass violence, but mental illness and guns can still be a lethal combination — sometimes seem to exist in a state of tension. We have to be able to talk about mental health and guns in a way that’s productive, in a way that doesn’t stigmatize mental illness, or gloss over the issues. Can we have a conversation about mental health and gun ownership that’s clear-eyed and factual, rather than an appeal to emotion? If we can’t, it will be very difficult to save thousands of lives every year.</p>
<h2>Mental Health Care Providers’ Role in Preventing Gun Violence</h2>
<p>One thing people who aren’t in the mental health community may not be aware of is that guns are already a topic of discussion between patients and care providers. People seeking counseling are often asked if they own or can access guns, and that may spark a further conversation: Could you maybe find someone to keep your guns for you while you work on a mental health issue? Can you ask that a housemate obtain and use a gun safe? Can parents do a better job at keeping guns out of the reach of children?</p>
<p>These intimate, individual conversations are designed to protect individual safety, but they also come with a framework of mandatory reporting law. Mental health providers are already required to inform the authorities if they think a client has both the will and the ability to harm themselves or others. Proposals to erode medical privacy with additional reporting laws tend to ignore the existing realities, as well as how difficult it can be to build and maintain a trusting working relationship with a client, who may fear being reported to law enforcement or other entities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/10/what-i-wish-someone-had-told-me-about-how-therapy-actually-works/" target="_blank">Patients who are afraid to open up</a> about what they’re experiencing cannot get the best possible care. And providers nervous about asking questions for fear of being caught up in a mandatory reporting law likewise can’t provide high quality care to people in need.</p>
<p>But the individual nature of these conversations points at a potentially powerful and productive way of talking about mental health and gun violence: What if the problem isn’t the mental illness, but the factors surrounding someone’s life and experience that push them in the direction of violence?</p>
<h2>The Conversation About Guns and Risk</h2>
<p>When we focus broadly on whether “the mentally ill” should have access to guns, we miss an important opportunity for a bigger conversation. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/better-mental-health-for-all/" target="_blank">Many people struggle to find services to help them manage their mental illnesses</a>, which increases the risk of having a severe episode that might end in homelessness, losing a job, or having a violent outburst.</p>
<p>How can we collectively reduce situations in which people — regardless of mental health status — think that resorting to violence will resolve a problem? And how do we limit access to tools of mass violence?</p>
<p>Many of the regulatory solutions to this issue are those that apply more broadly: Universal background check requirements could catch people who might be risks because of past activities known to predict future (or additional) gun violence. Waiting periods would make it harder for people in crisis to buy guns on the spot. Gun storage laws would better secure weapons and ammunition. Advocating for these kinds of requirements allows people to focus not on mentally ill people, but on risks: With every gun sale, what are the risks that gun will be used to kill someone? How can we reduce those risks?</p>
<p>It may be challenging to eliminate gun deaths entirely in a nation that believes very strongly in individual gun deaths, and one that continues to arm its police. But we can collaborate on reducing those deaths effectively, and in a way that doesn’t <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/09/the-stigma-of-depression/" target="_blank">stigmatize mentally ill people</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was a scared little 11-year-old going to therapy, I wished there were celebrities opening up about therapy who I could to relate to. As far as I knew, I was the only girl in the world who struggled with mental illness or saw a therapist. I lied to my friends about why I couldn&#8217;t hang out on Tuesday afternoons after school, because therapy seemed like the most taboo thing in the world to talk about.</p>
<p>Flash forward to 2018. There’s no shortage of headlines featuring celebrities sharing their stories about going to therapy. When these headlines first began popping up everywhere from E! News to Vogue, I couldn’t help but be bitter. Why was it okay for famous people to talk so openly about therapy, but it’s still so stigmatized for regular people to open up about seeing a therapist?</p>
<p><span id="more-9860"></span></p>
<p>When I disclose my depression to some people, all I do is scare them away — but when Selena Gomez opens up about her mental illness, she gets a <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/selena-gomez-april-cover-interview-mental-health-instagram" target="_blank">Vogue cover</a> reading “Selena gets real.” I remember joking to one of my fellow therapy-goers when that came out, “I talk to a therapist, where’s <i>my </i>Vogue cover?”</p>
<h2>Celebrities Struggle Too</h2>
<p>If there’s anything we can take away from this, it’s that even celebrities and the über talented are not immune to mental illness. Comedians are not immune to depression (in some cases, it’s a source of much of their material). <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/celebrities-who-battled-depression-and-came-out-strong/" target="_blank">Actresses are not immune to anxiety</a>. Musicians are not immune to PTSD. Famous people, they’re just like us!</p>
<p>While they may get preferential treatment in other aspects of life, they sure don’t get it when it comes to dodging mental illnesses. Based on the volume of stories that come out, it almost seems like a majority of Hollywood is in therapy. But it’s an important lesson. People who may seem like they “have it all” actually don’t, and people who may seem like they’re always happy actually aren’t. This goes for both celebrities and “regular” people.</p>
<h3>Who&#8217;s Talking about Therapy?</h3>
<p>Here are some examples of major celebrities that have recently <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_POST_INLINE&amp;utr_adgroup=the-new-rise-of-celebrities-talking-about-therapy?utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/celebrities-talking-therapy/" target="_blank">opened up about their issues and seeking therapy</a>:</p>
<p>Michael Phelps is a world champion swimmer and a 28-time medalist — truly one of the most successful athletes the world has ever known. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/michael/" target="_blank">He goes to therapy and credits it with saving his life</a>.</p>
<p>Jennifer Aniston has won a Golden Globe, a Primetime Emmy Award, and a Sag Award. <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/617078/jennifer-aniston-opens-up-about-her-years-of-therapy-i-needed-help-expressing-my-anger" target="_blank">She goes to therapy. </a></p>
<p>Brad Pitt is one of the most attractive men in the world. He’s been nominated for 5 Oscars and won one. <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/brad-pitt-gq-style-cover-story" target="_blank">He goes to therapy.</a></p>
<p>Katy Perry has been nominated for 13 Grammys. She goes to therapy. In fact, she <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5q56an" target="_blank">live streamed a full therapy session</a>.</p>
<p>Prince Harry is literal British royalty, descending from the queen of England. He goes to <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/04/prince-harry-reveals-he-went-to-therapy-to-process-princess-diana-death/amp" target="_blank">therapy</a> — and admits he waited too long before doing so.</p>
<p>Jay-Z has won 21 Grammys (and has been nominated for 74) AND is married to the queen of America, Beyoncé. He goes to therapy — hell, he <a href="https://themighty.com/2017/06/jay-z-therapist-therapy-444/" target="_blank">RAPS about going to therapy</a>!</p>
<p>You get the point. The list goes on and on, and it&#8217;s clear that mental illness doesn&#8217;t discriminate. It doesn&#8217;t care if you&#8217;re an Oscar winner or a royal. Not-so-great things can happen to you no matter what. Mental illness is not directly correlated to how beautiful you are, how much you have, or how many awards you&#8217;ve won. Everybody needs help sometimes.</p>
<h2>Using Their Platform for Good</h2>
<p>Now that I’m not nearly as bitter about the whole phenomenon, I hope this movement doesn’t die down. I hope celebrities will continue to use their platforms for good, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/04/talkspace-co-founder-roni-frank-talks-disrupting-stigma-and-the-futureoftherapy/" target="_blank">opening up about therapy</a> to encourage people of all ages and backgrounds to seek the help they need, and not be ashamed of it. A great example of this is Demi Lovato, who will be offering <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/demi-lovato-offers-free-therapy-sessions-new-tour-w515844" target="_blank">free therapy</a> to fans on her tour. How amazing is that!?</p>
<p>By speaking publicly about mental illness and therapy, they’re raising awareness. Most importantly, the stigma breaks a little bit each time somebody openly discusses therapy or their mental illness — celebrity or not!</p>
<p>The message is: You are not alone. Even if you don’t have friends or family members who struggle with the same things you do, you at least know that <i>someone </i>out there knows exactly what you’re dealing with — and it might just be your favorite celebrity.</p>

Talkspace shares stories of how therapy helps people of all backgrounds work through the daily challenges of modern life.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>When I stop to think about the role of therapy in my life, it is not difficult to realize how essential it was for me to become the person I am today. I met my current therapist five years ago when I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder. I had panic attacks and could barely get out of the house, so my therapy sessions were the only time I socialized with anyone — and it was like that for a few months.</p>
<p><span id="more-9783"></span></p>
<p>At first <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/10/what-i-wish-someone-had-told-me-about-how-therapy-actually-works/" target="_blank">I wasn’t sure how my psychologist could help me</a>, and I didn’t really feel comfortable opening myself to her. Everything I said was calculated, and since I was so insecure and destabilized, I feared that she would judge me if I was completely sincere. Over time, the calm and tranquility that I felt as we dealt with my problems made me increasingly spontaneous and secure in sharing my thoughts. Every time I sat in that green chair, she was there to support me and not to judge — indeed, she helped me get rid of my own stigma around my mental illness.</p>
<p>In one of the sessions, I said that I was <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/how-staying-in-a-job-you-hate-affects-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">worried about my professional life</a> and I had no idea what direction to go. I had graduated in advertising and had gone through dozens of jobs that I hated. I never lasted more than a few days in them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/talkspace_marcela-sabia_green-chair.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-9792 alignright" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/talkspace_marcela-sabia_green-chair-255x300.jpg" alt="talkspace_marcela-sabia_green-chair" width="255" height="300" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/talkspace_marcela-sabia_green-chair-255x300.jpg 255w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/talkspace_marcela-sabia_green-chair-768x905.jpg 768w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/talkspace_marcela-sabia_green-chair-869x1024.jpg 869w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/talkspace_marcela-sabia_green-chair.jpg 1567w" sizes="(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like a failure,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what did you like to do to have fun when you were a kid?&#8221; my therapist said with a kind smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I loved to draw,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you thought about drawing again? See how you it feels? Maybe it&#8217;s a good idea and you find a new hobby,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>That day I went back to the house and immediately got a sheet of paper and a pencil. Without thinking much, I began to trace and was flooded with a sense of well-being. That was it!</p>
<p>Therapy has allowed me to have the profession I have today. Without the brilliant insight of my psychologist, I may not have found myself artistically and resumed my life normally.</p>
<p>Having someone professionally prepared to advise and suggest new points of view is really helpful and enlightening. I started practicing illustrations daily and with the help of my therapist, I got the courage to pursue a career as a professional illustrator. It not only gave me a purpose, but a deep self-knowledge and the ability to deal with adversities in a more mature way. Over time, I started to use my drawings to talk about my mental health, and this was what brought recognition and admirers to my work. I saw that I was not alone, and sharing my experience of therapy was a positive thing for myself and many others.</p>
<p>Later, when a long relationship ended, I already had a the tools to deal with the pain I felt. Just as I had found the path in my professional life with psychological help, I knew I would have the support to recover in my love life. I had several more sessions with my therapist, to help clearly realize how unhappy and stagnant I was, and to take advantage of the unique opportunity I was given to be myself completely — single, independent, and able to pursue my dreams.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I can say that <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_POST_INLINE&amp;utr_adgroup=therapy-helped-me-be-myself?utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/therapy-helped-me-be-myself" target="_blank">therapy has rebuilt me</a>. It helped me to observe and analyze my life and thoughts without so much judgment, and see things more lightly. I have become a much better person and will always be grateful for it. I continue to sit in the green armchair in that small room every week to talk, listen, and evolve a little more. And so life goes on.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is part of our <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/tag/therapy-helped-me">#TherapyHelpedMe</a> series for Mental Health Awareness Month. Talkspace shares stories of how therapy helps people of all backgrounds work through the daily challenges of modern life.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Many of us are aware of therapy and its positive benefits. Maybe you read Freud in college, are familiar with portrayals of therapists from film or TV, or see negative stories about a celebrity’s mental health on tabloid covers in the supermarket checkout aisle. What you hear less often are the stories of therapy’s profound effects on those who try it and the unexpectedly life-changing ways it can improve well-being, regardless of your challenges.</p>
<p><span id="more-9747"></span></p>
<p>May is Mental Health Awareness Month, and it’s important to recognize the struggles faced by those suffering from mental illness. In 2016, <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/major-depression.shtml" target="_blank">an estimated 16.2 million adults in the United States — or 6.7% of all adults — had at least one major depressive episode</a>. Equally alarming, <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/any-anxiety-disorder.shtml" target="_blank">an estimated 19.1% of U.S. adults dealt with an anxiety disorder</a> in the past year.</p>
<p>Therapy is proven to be effective in treating these conditions, but despite these staggering statistics many people avoid seeking out therapy. They imagine it’s just for the seriously mentally ill or the rich. However, therapy can have a tremendous impact on anyone looking for more productive, effective ways of dealing with the everyday stress of modern life. Therapy can help all of us.</p>
<p>We decided to look into the lives of 20 people, to see how therapy has helped them.</p>
<p><iframe width="660" height="371" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MFLsoqdkILU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>We&#8217;d love for others to hear <em>your</em> story of how therapy helped you overcome your daily challenges. Adding more voices to the conversation helps reduce stigma around mental health conversations, and gives strength to others seeking help. Use the #TherapyHelpedMe hashtag, and tag us on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/talkspace" target="_blank">Instagram</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/talkspace" target="_blank">Twitter</a> to be a part of the conversation.</p>
<p>If you feel it&#8217;s time to see if therapy works for you, <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_POST_INLINE&amp;utr_adgroup=mental-health-awareness-month-therapy-helped-me?utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/%20therapy-helped-me-mental-health-awareness-month">chat with a Talkspace therapist today</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year’s message for World Health Day was “Health For All.” According to the World Health Organization (WHO), “<a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs395/en/" target="_blank">at least half of the world’s population still do not have full coverage of essential health services</a>.” Their goal is to see <a href="http://apps.who.int/uhc/en/" target="_blank">one billion more people given access to full health care services by 2023</a>.</p>
<p>While Talkspace’s mission has always been “Therapy For All,” we’re actively championing an even more universal goal across the globe: “Better Mental Health For All,”. This includes campaigning for mental health coverage as part of universal health care, and being an active part of the important conversation around mental health.</p>
<p><span id="more-9563"></span></p>
<h2>Mental Health Conditions Affect Hundreds of Millions</h2>
<p>Worldwide, more than 300 million people of all ages suffer from depression, making it the <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs369/en/" target="_blank">world’s leading cause of disability</a>. Depression’s effects include insomnia, overeating, and immunosuppressive conditions. These complications are major contributors to the <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/" target="_blank">leading causes of death across the world</a>: heart disease, respiratory diseases, cancer, and diabetes.</p>
<p>Anxiety disorders are also prevalent, where “<a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/any-anxiety-disorder.shtml" target="_blank">an estimated 31.1% of U.S. adults experience any anxiety disorder at some time in their lives</a>,” according the the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Like depression, anxiety disorders have debilitating symptoms that affect a person’s ability to participate in certain social settings, or ability to deliver work in a professional environment.</p>
<p>Combined, depression and anxiety disorders alone affect <a href="http://www.who.int/mental_health/world-mental-health-day/2017/en/" target="_blank"><i>over half a billion people around the world</i></a>. Considering the numerous diagnoses outside of these spectrums that affect millions more on a daily basis, the importance of mental health coverage for all cannot be overstated.</p>
<h2>How Talkspace is Contributing to Mental Health</h2>
<h3>Innovating Online Therapy Technology</h3>
<p>Talkspace is actively working to broaden access to mental health care through mobile technology, data-driven feedback-informed therapy (FIT), and providing a much more affordable option for anyone seeking mental health care.</p>
<p>“Today, all you need to receive quality mental health care is a computer with internet connection, or the Talkspace mobile app,” <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/therapy-for-all/" target="_blank">Oren Frank, co-founder of Talkspace recently mentioned</a> “Users can message their therapists from anywhere, anytime — using text, audio, video and/or picture messages. Talkspace is therapy for how we live today, providing the flexibility your life demands.”</p>
<p>Talkspace connects you with professional therapists <a href="http://talkspace.com" target="_blank">through web browsers</a>, and via a mobile app on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id661829386?mt=8" target="_blank">Apple’s iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.talkspace.talkspaceapp" target="_blank">Google’s Android</a>. And though the increase of wellness initiatives may represent a net good, it’s important to understand that as <a href="https://work.qz.com/author/oren-frank/" target="_blank">Oren recently reiterated to Quartz</a>, mental health and wellness are not the same.</p>
<p>For a complete picture of our technology-backed therapy vision, take a few minutes to watch <a href="https://videos.websummit.net/websummit/2015/videos/Oren_Frank_Ben_Heubl_mind_over_mobile_digitising_mental_health.html" target="_blank">Oren’s Web Summit talk</a> on Talkspace’s origins and our desire to democratize therapy.</p>
<h3>Therapy for All, No Matter the Scenario</h3>
<p>Mental health needs are as unique as the individuals that seek help for their challenges. In addition to intelligently matched individual therapy, Talkspace provides online therapy for different life scenarios and occupational situations.</p>
<p>Consider the fact that LGBT individuals are three times as likely to experience a mental health condition, <a href="https://www.nami.org/find-support/lgbtq" target="_blank">according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)</a>. Talkspace not only offers <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/lgbt/" target="_blank">online therapy with LGBT individuals in mind</a>, but proudly partners with therapists who are part of the LGBT community themselves.</p>
<p>Veterans returning home from active combat face a higher risk of mental health challenges. The American Psychological Association (APA) reports that <a href="https://www.apa.org/advocacy/military-veterans/mental-health-needs.pdf" target="_blank">over 20 percent of these veterans return home with Traumatic Brain Injury and PTSD</a>. The same publication mentions that veterans with PTSD were at risk for for suicidal ideation at a rate four times higher than those who did not. Talkspace therapists with PTSD expertise are available to those who have served.</p>
<p>Finally, while couples often attempt to solve relationship problems on their own, this path has the potential to further drive a wedge between the partners. Talkspace offers online therapy to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/couples-therapy/" target="_blank">help guide couples</a> through communication, commitment, and anything that pops up along the way.</p>
<p>No matter the diagnosis or impetus for therapy, Talkspace is available to put you in touch with a therapist within the hour. This is our hope for the world, and the driver behind “Therapy For All.”</p>
<h3>Dismantling Stigma Around Mental Health</h3>
<p>Another important part of the Talkspace mission is to reduce stigma around mental health diagnoses, and empower those who seek to better their lives with solutions like online therapy. By providing resources to those hesitant about taking the next steps toward therapy, our wish is to contribute a powerful voice in favor of mental health care solutions.</p>
<p>“We are here to say, ‘Yeah. Therapy is amazing,’” Oren Frank said in a recent speech, after <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/04/talkspace-ceo-oren-frank-on-mental-health-care-innovation-curing-the-american-nightmare/" target="_blank">referring to national mental health care coverage as an “American nightmare.”</a> “We want to make sure people understand that, and this is a method for us to fight stigma and remove it.”</p>

<p>Talkspace is at the forefront of eliminating this stigma by providing accessible online therapy and mental health resources to broader segments of society. Whether though our <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/" target="_blank">blog</a>, our presence on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/talkspace/?hl=en" target="_blank">social networks</a>, hosting <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/future-of-therapy-2016/welcome-address-by-oren-frank/" target="_blank">conferences</a>, or appearing on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx_klWiebps" target="_blank">national television</a>, Talkspace’s intent is to contribute to the mental health conversation and to say definitively, wherever the opportunity presents itself: There is nothing shameful about needing mental health care.</p>
<h2>The Future of Better Mental Health is Online Therapy</h2>
<p>As the industry leader, we love to talk about the future of mental health care. However, it’s relevant to state that online therapy <i>is</i> that future.</p>
<p>A sobering fact remains that those who need mental health assistance aren’t able to receive it, or choose not to seek care. According to a report by Mental Health America (MHA), in the U.S. alone <a href="http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/new-state-rankings-shines-light-mental-health-crisis-show-differences-blue-red-states" target="_blank">over 55 percent of adults don’t receive treatment for mental illness</a>. The same report mentions that 6 out of 10 American youths who require treatment of major depression never receive it. Globally, the “<a href="http://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/atlas/executive_summary_en.pdf?ua=1" target="_blank">median number of mental health workers is 9 per 100,000 population</a>”.</p>
<p>By reducing the barrier to entry for therapy — an evidence-based method of improving mental health outcomes — through its use of technology and data, Talkspace is helping to provide access to better mental health for all. Nearly one million people have considered Talkspace for its affordability, accessibility, and the ability to seek therapy on their terms. Our strategic partnerships with major health care providers, and employee assistance programs, are bringing us closer to our mission of providing global access to mental health care.</p>
<p>“Better Mental Health For All” may be a clarion call, but we’re determined to turn this demand into a fundamental human right by building confidence in <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/">online therapy’s benefits</a>, one person at a time.</p>
