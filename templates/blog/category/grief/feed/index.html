				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you share your life with animals, it’s easy to think of them as part of the family — like the cat who occupies my desk whenever I’m working, patiently waiting for me to take a break and play. Dogs were domesticated <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/06/dogs-may-have-been-domesticated-more-once" target="_blank">nearly 14,000 years ago</a> as working animals but undoubtedly developed a role as pets at the same time, while cats appear to have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0139.epdf?referrer_access_token=hlWXRrLjkunFyYWbuG8GTtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0P1-hlCK4xw03Oq1bTQkuMR_3f41vJJxbr_usWRU5icq88MPWHCU8oyr5gMkFZpXQGYLcVuG4VolEDPlHH6hOFv0gKPzCGyP-GS7pGA8oyb85N6nR1WddbF8axUxWL2tILd1dZ8uK0zKUeIif4yIq8UzAOliwKiuK26WWjyS4KCGQ%3D%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=news.nationalgeographic.com" target="_blank">domesticated themselves</a> multiple times, possibly as early as the Neolithic era. Sixty-eight percent of households <a href="https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-pet-statistics" target="_blank">keep animals</a>, including not just cats and dogs but rats, hamsters, rabbits, fish, horses, and more.</p>
<p>But with the benefits of pets comes an inevitable dark side: What happens when the beloved animals who have become important parts of our lives pass away, leaving us with urns on our desks instead of warm bodies?</p>
<p><span id="more-9379"></span></p>
<h2>Mental health benefits of pet ownership</h2>
<p>Letting the risk of loss dictate life decisions can be a grim way to live, though, especially when keeping pets can come with ample rewards, including a range of quality of life improvements for people who keep animals in their lives. Lori Kogan, a professor at Colorado State University who focuses on human-animal interaction, told Talkspace these benefits shouldn’t be understated. “There’s growing support for the idea that there’s a bevy of benefits to pet ownership.”</p>
<p>That starts with physical benefits, and not just the merits of being forced to stretch your legs and go outside for a walk with your dog. In one study, for example, researchers found that teens with diabetes were <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25614529" target="_blank">better able to control their health</a> when they cared for fish — they theorized that this may be because caring for an animal prompted better personal habits when it came to monitoring their glucose. Similarly, in some cases, having pets in childhood appears to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28939248" target="_blank">reduce the risk of asthma</a>. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/health-benefits/" target="_blank">CDC states</a> that pets can reduce blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides.</p>
<p>“Animals can be a tremendous source of psychological support,” said Kogan. Keeping a pet can, for some, be literally lifesaving: A reason to get up in the morning, to eat, to get moving. Dolly Parton <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781613735169" target="_blank">once commented</a> that her dog Popeye saved her life when she was in the depths of despair; while contemplating suicide, she heard him racing up the stairs, and rethought her decision.</p>
<p>Having pets around can be beneficial for some people with developmental, intellectual, or cognitive disabilities — they may increase self-confidence or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25913902" target="_blank">act as social buffers</a> to make people more comfortable. Likewise, older adults may derive important companionship from beloved pets, as aging can cause isolation; that’s one reason Kagan works to keep pets and seniors together, as surrendering a pet due to inability to afford or manage care can be devastating.</p>
<h2>Preparing for the loss of a pet</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the life spans of most of the animals we welcome into our homes are significantly shorter than our own — except for fortunate tortoise and parrot owners. Whether in seven, 14, or 21 years, people who adopt rabbits, dogs, or horses will eventually face the end of an animal’s life, an experience can that be traumatic and, Kogan said, sometimes alienating.</p>
<p>“For many people, that grief is just as real and palpable as any other family member or close friend. Often, it’s a kind of disenfranchised grief because it’s not recognized or supported.” Many people who’ve lost pets are familiar with attitudes like “why can’t you just get over it?” And “you can always just get another one.” They may struggle to express themselves and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/the-grief-olympics-death-cafe/" target="_blank">feel like it’s not acceptable to show that they’re grieving</a>. For parents dealing with their own emotions while supporting children through the experience of what may be the first death of someone beloved and close to them, the death of a pet can be even more complicated.</p>
<p>Pets and humans tend to die in very different ways — euthanasia is a common outcome for pets, allowing people to feel more of a measure of control in the face of pain and suffering. Frank counseling from a veterinarian can also help people explore anticipatory grief, preparing for death rather than being taken by surprise. Unfortunately, veterinarians aren’t always good at having these challenging conversations, as Kogan has found in her research.</p>
<p>“I’ve talked to a lot of people who are really surprised when they grieve stronger or more over the death of an animal than the death of a family member,” said Kogan. “They feel really guilty about that. I tell them our relationship with our animals tends to be pretty pure. It’s a loving relationship, period. Our relationships with our family members tend not to be that pure.” The death of a pet may also bring up emotions associated with prior losses, creating a complicated reaction that’s bigger than burying Fido.</p>
<h2>Natural reactions to pet loss</h2>
<p>As when much beloved humans die, individual reactions to the death of a pet can be highly varied. Kogan said some people may experience extremely intense, lasting grief. Others may adopt a new pet almost immediately, sometimes because anticipatory grief allowed them to process many of their feelings prior to the death. Grief may be complicated by feelings of guilt, especially in cases where people decide to euthanize their pets.</p>
<p>There’s nothing unhealthy about grief — it’s a natural reaction to a significant life event. The stages of grief don’t always come in perfect order, and sometimes loop back on themselves, and this doesn’t mean that someone is grieving “incorrectly.” Just because it’s not pathological, though, doesn’t mean that people can’t benefit from counseling or support groups, spending time with people who share their experience and have recommendations for coping tactics. Similarly, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/02/4-important-life-lessons-learned-therapy/" target="_blank">therapy can help people think through their experience and process it in a safe environment</a>, moving forward — but not necessarily moving on.</p>
<p>However, there are instances in which grief can become debilitating, making it impossible to function. Grief may affect relationships, make it difficult to go to work, or leave people with a feeling of being “stuck,” rather than moving forward. In children, difficulty with grief can sometimes manifest as acting out, or experiencing significant behavioral changes. In these cases, there are lots of counseling options available to help.</p>
<h2>Solutions for coping with the loss of a pet</h2>
<p>A number of veterinary schools run <a href="http://www.chancesspot.org/hotlines.php" target="_blank">pet loss hotlines</a>, providing a space for people to call and talk with an empathetic person familiar with these issues. People can also attend individual or group therapy, or visit support groups, to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/finding-help-complicated-grief/" target="_blank">develop healthy coping skills and work through their grief</a>. Just as grief itself is highly individual, so is counseling; one therapist may be an excellent fit for one person but not another, and if a therapeutic relationship doesn’t feel like it’s working well, people can explore referrals to other therapists. Finding someone who specializes in grief counseling, especially if they have experience with pet loss, can be particularly beneficial.</p>
<p>For those struggling to support — or understand — someone coping with the loss of a pet, Kogan said, it’s best to “meet people where they are.” That may include supporting people with a memorial or other event to commemorate, or simply making a point of spending time together; inviting someone out for tea, or stopping by their house with a present. Something like photographs or a favorite story about the deceased pet can be comforting.</p>
<p>Simply acknowledging that the loss of a pet can be traumatic can also be beneficial, affirming that it’s okay to experience sorrow. And, whatever you do, don’t ask when they’re “getting another one.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The text message hit like cannon fire from close range. I crumbled to the ground, holding my stomach. It was an early morning winter in the kitchen of our Brooklyn apartment. My wife and two kids came running. “What’s wrong?” &#8220;What happened?” &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?”</p>
<p>What happened? What was wrong? Mike O’Shea was going to die. And I’d be introduced to a grief that would cripple me for many years.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>I like to think that Mike and I had been friends since before we were born. Not in some other life, but in the wombs of our mothers who were neighbors in a small New Jersey town, and both expecting in the summer of 1968. Our mothers had not been close prior to pregnancy — of different generations and ethnic backgrounds — but they bonded over pregnancy and both gave birth to boys in the first week of July.<span id="more-8344"></span></p>
<p>The five days between our births were practically the only time Mike and I would be separated. We were even baptized together; the only two babies to take the water that day. My earliest memories include Mike and me as babies, in our mothers&#8217; arms; waddling around front yards; playing together in backyards on our own.</p>
<p>Mike attended Catholic school and I went to the nearby public grammar, but we met nearly everyday after school — and first thing on weekends and all summer long — without ever making plans. We just showed up at the dead end in front of my house, connecting with each other first before joining the other neighborhood kids who ran riot in the 70s suburban paradise that surrounded us: school yards and fields, hills and gullies, train tracks, and a magical corridor of towering pines where we built tree houses and had rock fights. We’d go wild until the call of parents brought us home for dinner. In summer, we’d meet up again after dinner as the cicadas roared and lightning bugs blinked in the liquid night.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>When I was 12, my family did what no other family in our neighborhood had: We moved. Upward mobility was not part of the program for those so firmly rooted in the middle class, but my father was ambitious, abandoning his career as a music teacher for the pursuit of opportunities in business. He would succeed, though his promotions often required relocation, and the next 10 years of my life would involve itinerancy and great periods of displacement. Mike was there for me throughout.</p>
<p>We didn’t write letters and only occasionally spoke on the phone, but I’d stay with Mike each summer when my family visited the New York area from our midwestern locale. And when we moved back to the Northeast, my first year of high school, Mike and I practically split the summer between my new house and his old home. And when I attended a boarding school in western New Jersey for senior year, it was Mike who appeared early and often to fetch me for weekends of football games and house parties.</p>
<p>There was great comfort in all these visits. A semblance of normalcy and camaraderie during an often lonely adolescence. I eventually made friends everywhere we moved, but it took years, and even after arriving socially, so to speak, it wasn’t the same. I might have been liked but I wasn’t really known. With Mike, I was both, and that was a type of validation I needed during those difficult years.</p>
<p>What made Mike’s unconditional friendship even more rewarding was that he’d grown into a figure of extraordinary status, one that transcended the tag of popular. Cute as a kid — sandy hair and fair eyes, a shy smile — Mike had morphed into handsome, in a rugged and shining Irish way. He had a movie star elan about him. And he had grown massive, pumping tons of iron, buttressed by a black belt in Shodokan.</p>
<p>All of this was accompanied by a life-of-the-party personality informed by the civic obligation of the good cop his father was and that Mike desired to be. The baby brother of two sisters and two brothers had Mike comfortable socially with both genders: The girls adored him; the boys wanted to be his friend. And Mike did not disappoint.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Mike and I married two of the town’s most beautiful girls: I stood in his wedding party; he was my best man. My wife and I lived in the city; Mike and his wife lived near our hometown. We spent much time together as couples, drinking and eating and traveling. Mike and I went to Italy alone to celebrate our 40th birthdays. Our kids looked like us, and the nostalgia of watching them play was nearly overwhelming.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>A few thousand people showed up at Mike’s wake. His funeral was an orgy of grief. The figure he became in high school continued through the college years and into the adulthood. Other than a stint in the LAPD, Mike remained in the area in various forms of law enforcement, expanding his legendary status. He’d become larger than life and was a truly a celebrity — a benevolent protector with a heart of gold and a love of life. A full police escort led his body from the church to cemetery.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>I had more buckled than cried when the cannonball hit me with the news of Mike’s death. But at the cemetery, in a brutal January freeze, under a sheet of ice-blue sky, I lost it for real as I faced Mike’s casket and, like the hundreds in front of me and the hundreds behind, was supposed to touch the wood and say goodbye to the figure inside. I tried. As I wandered off without direction, the cruel air froze much of the tears before they could fall, though I knew the emotional surge was like something I’d never felt. And I knew that I was in trouble.</p>
<p>My beloved mother had died two years earlier. I understood the grieving process and what mourning feels like and what the “new normal” is all about. I didn’t do such a great job with all that, unable to reconcile the jargon with the reality of loss, but, even though I missed my mother very much, I carried on in much of the manner I had before with a sense of self still intact. Mike’s death blew all that up.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>I didn’t know what to do. Or what to call how I felt. Despite my challenges growing up, I’d never felt any real emotional instability; in fact, I prided myself on being able to handle whatever life had thrown at me (and it had thrown a lot). But this was different. The sorrow would not let me be, interrupting moments of normalcy, dousing moments of joy, crushing me at times like the cannon fire that began this war with suffering.</p>
<p>This is when I should have sought help. I knew it was bigger than me, but I just wasn’t convinced that I was worthy. Mike’s widow and their kids were seeing someone; some of Mike’s siblings were also in counseling. But I wasn’t Mike’s wife or sibling or child. I was just a kid who grew up with him and had no business associating my loss with those who shared his last name, with those whose lives would — today and tomorrow and forever — be directly affected by his death.</p>
<p>I couldn’t talk about it to my wife or anyone else. I felt ashamed. And selfish.Was I actually more waylaid by the death of a friend than the death of my own mother? How could I possibly admit this?</p>
<p>I scrambled to cope.</p>
<p>I prescribed a steady dose of medicinal martinis, which really did help in the moment — a numbing succor and immediate emotional uplift — though the effect was short lived and, well, booze is, after all, a depressant and not a solution.</p>
<p>A serendipitous game of basketball delivered physical exertion as a form of emotional relief. I started working out regularly, and it helped. A lot. I imagined Mike with me, pushing me beyond normal limits. This was certainly more effective than the medicinal martinis, but still not enough.</p>
<p>I wrote about Mike fairly often. He had always praised my storytelling skills, and when I first dabbled in narratives, as a college student, it was stories about our childhood that emerged. And when I announced in my early 30s that I was abandoning my successful career in sales to pursue writing, Mike was my biggest champion, acknowledging my courage and expressing faith in my talent. Having him in the audience at readings made those moments extra special. The memory of a bright-eyed Mike at my first book release party, as many copies as he could carry under each arm, is the highlight of my writing life. After his death, a handful of articles about him brought some relief, but it wasn’t enough.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>A few years after Mike’s death, I started crying in my sleep. I didn’t know if it was out loud or not. My wife never mentioned it, so I assumed it was happening silently, though that didn’t make it any less real.</p>
<p>And then the tears began when I was awake. Random moments when I’d simply feel overwhelmed. I never cried in movies; now I did. Certain songs had to be avoided. I cried on the subway and once in a classroom. Visiting Mike’s wife and kids often involved a trip to the bathroom for a bawl as watching our kids play together no longer inspired nostalgia but agony. And then there was the watershed episode brought on by a random thought.</p>
<p>In June of 2016, I was driving home from Boston after an indulgent night celebrating the birthday of a cousin with his sister. The three of us had the kind of night we’d talk about forever, and I recalled the fantastic events as I raced down the Mass Pike toward some family engagements back in New York. Of course, my dear cousins knew Mike O’Shea. Everybody who knew me knew Mike O’Shea. And as soon as I finished constructing the narrative in my head, had the story straight, properly embellished and selectively edited, I thought: Can’t wait to tell Mike.</p>
<p>The tears surprised me at first with their presence and then with their volume. I heaved and coughed and cried as an onslaught of anguish came up from my chest and down from my eyes and out of my blubbering mouth. “I miss my friend,” I said out loud. I was physically sick from suffering and had to pull over at a rest stop. I collected myself and got back on the road. And then it happened again, an hour or so later. “I miss my friend,” I said again. I got home four hours late; my wife was not happy. I never called to say I’d be late, and I never told her why.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>It was that broken drive from Boston that started the reconciliation of my grief. Over a year later, I am able to somewhat understand why Mike’s death shuddered me with its news and then kept me emotionally addled for what will soon be five years: Mike knew me better than anyone else ever had or ever would. We spent so much time together growing up, so immersed in the magic of childhood, so engaged in the wonder of exploration and adventure, so connected by ritual and shared space and secrets, it was like our DNA had merged: spit and blood and sweat. Baptism water. Maybe it was also all the soda cans and candy bars and t-shirts and beds and back seats and bike seats and toilet seats we shared; the waters we swam in and the grass on which we fell; the trees we climbed and the balls we threw to each other and the asphalt that tore our knees. The times we just met by the dead end. The arms we threw naturally around each other’s shoulders.</p>
<p>And then Mike, the larger than life teenager, helped carry me through my itinerant adolescence and delivered me into adulthood with a sense of self and a sense of security in knowing that one of the most amazing human beings I’d ever known was more than my oldest friend, he was part of my identity. I could have easily applied this litmus test to anyone who would claim to really know me: Do you know Mike O’Shea?</p>
<p>He was part of me. And then he wasn’t.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>I won’t detail the suffering and damage I created for myself and those around me during these years in denial about my grief. I also won’t claim to be through it yet; I needed and still need help making sense of my situation and finding a way to reconnect to my relationship with Mike, to make him part of me again and to move on with my life in a way that is healthy and complete.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sprinting down a crowded New York street is inherently cinematic. More than once, I’ve imagined myself on the big screen while running to catch a bus. Secretly, I love the hustle. Moving faster than those around me, looking harried and focused, is a way of silently communicating what I’d never say aloud: Look at me! I’m going places! Watch me pass you by!</p>
<p>October 2013, approximately four years ago: I’m clomping down Sixth Avenue, weaving through the Midtown after-work crowd, my water bottle and empty Tupperware clanging together in my canvas tote. I’m en route to a mediocre Chinese restaurant to talk about death with a bunch of strangers, and I’m running late, as usual. But running late to a Death Café feels like a hackneyed metaphor, a body in motion a painfully prescient reminder of the end destination.<span id="more-7675"></span></p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with it, the Death Cafe movement is a humble concept turned worldwide phenomenon. Gather a group of people who want to discuss mortality, provide a private space, food, and a trained leader, and start talking. The monthly meetings are free and open to the public with a suggested donation. I think the food cost all of $11.00. Participants are encouraged to share their personal experiences. Existential angst is optional but welcome, at least at the Manhattan meeting.</p>
<p>By the time I arrive, Death Cafe is in progress. Both China Sun restaurant and the people in it are relics from bygone 80s New York: Frosted hair, black lacquered bar, Wes Anderson vibe. I head up to the second floor, where round tables perfect for family-style dining are filled with grievers, healers, and observers. This, I think, is my tribe.</p>
<p>The attendees, about 15 of us that day, are split into small conversation groups. Waiters bring noodle soup and scallion pancakes. I practice active listening and make eye contact as we go around the table introducing ourselves and explaining what brought us here. One woman about my age reveals she has a life-threatening autoimmune disorder, another is working on a documentary about losing a sibling, inspired by her brother’s death in childhood. A middle-aged woman explains she doesn’t want a drawn-out death, like her mother’s, and tells us that there’s a place in Switzerland (or maybe Scandinavia?) that does euthanasia for a few grand. The group casually banters about assisted suicide as if we were discussing where to get a flu shot. I sit quietly, afraid of crunching my scallion pancake too loudly in the middle of someone’s harrowing story.</p>
<p>Next, a gentle older man shares a made-for-television love story in his thick New York accent. He met his wife in early adulthood, they married other people, got divorced, reconnected years later, and married one another, and now she’s dying. I don’t remember of what. All I remember is how much he loved her.</p>
<p>It’s my turn. My own loss — my father, to cancer — suddenly seems unremarkable. Banal, even. In a room where death and grief are common denominators, I’m not the only one with a gaping wound. In this context, grappling with grief and actively searching for meaning doesn’t make me special. It makes me cliché.</p>
<p>The baseline at my table is profound loss. Coming to Death Cafe, I expected catharsis and sympathy. Instead, listening to other people’s stories spurred a disconcerting realization: Even in suffering, I’m competitive. I don’t want solace. I want to win by having the most irreparable loss.</p>
<p>Sitting at Death Cafe, I felt ashamed. Grief, as I saw it, was something to vanquish. If it was the enemy, I was the heroine, stronger after a long struggle. I wanted to banish grief in part because I did not want my father’s death to define my twenties. I wanted people to see my accomplishments, or sense of humor, yet nothing felt as pronounced or lasting as grief. Instead, the opposite happened: by battling against grief it shaped me fully. In the same way an unbending tree is gnarled by mighty winds, my desire to be saddest made me a little twisted. I brandished grief like a badge of honor because I couldn’t figure out the middle ground between having loss mean everything, and having it mean nothing at all.</p>
<p>Death cafe’s popularity, I believe, stems from the fact it captures the paradox of death and grief: Hearing highly specific stories about loss also illustrates its universality. After a session or three, I soon realized that striving to be the girl with the saddest story meant that I didn’t have to work toward a different goal: figuring out what, exactly, I was hurtling toward in this life with such force. It meant dealing with my own loss, doing the work of healing. Stopping equaled mortality, and on some level shifting my grief — I don’t believe we ever get over a loss, it simply moves from foreground to background — meant recognizing my own mortality. But I needed to be reminded that I had — have — a full life to live, which is why I went back to Death Cafe again, and again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: If you are in a life threatening situation call +1 (800) 273-8255 or use <a href="https://helpnow.talkspace.com/" target="_blank">these resources</a> to get immediate help.</em></p>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong></p>
<p>I was 24 when Adam died. We were both 24. I had a missed call at 3am on my phone from my old roommate in Albuquerque, Eric. My boyfriend Chris dropped me off at my apartment early in the morning so I could get ready for work and I listened to the voicemail as I walked in my front door. Eric sounded distraught. “Call me back,” was all he said. So I called him back, even though it was 5am where he was.</p>
<p>“Our friend, Adam,” he said, choking through tears, “he’s gone. He killed himself.”<span id="more-6899"></span></p>
<p>I didn’t believe him. I demanded an explanation.</p>
<p>“He hanged himself,” he told me.</p>
<p>I couldn’t stand up. I leaned against the oven in the kitchen. I slid to the dirty linoleum floor.</p>
<p>“Liz called me last night,” Eric explained. “She and Adam had the same therapist. The therapist told her.”</p>
<p>I hung up the phone and I dialed Adam’s number, leaving message after message. “Adam, this better not be true,” I demanded. “Call me back. Call me back!”</p>
<p>I called Chris, panicking. I felt like I was screaming. Chris came and got me.</p>
<p>I called out from work, frantic. I couldn’t breathe.</p>
<p>I called everyone I knew. I called everyone who I knew had ever met Adam. It was late October and it was cold in northern New Jersey. I walked through the park with Chris so I didn’t have to be inside and I made call after call on my phone, looking through the numbers I had and telling everyone.</p>
<p>Adam was my best friend.</p>
<p><strong>Day 2</strong></p>
<p>Somehow Chris and I drove to my parents’ apartment in Washington, D.C. so that I could get a flight home to Albuquerque for the memorial service.</p>
<p><strong>Day 4</strong></p>
<p>I felt like a mother hen gathering my chickens. As Adam’s best friend from afar, I was relegated to the “kids’ table” at the memorial service. I wasn’t part of the organizing. But everyone who saw me told me through tears, “He loved you, he loved you.” I had a troupe of Adam’s ex-girlfriends and the friends his parents didn’t know. We went out for Halloween the night before his memorial service, dressed as zombie baristas. It was a perfect costume. None of us could do much other than stare into space.</p>
<p><strong>Day 7</strong></p>
<p>I went to his parents’ house while they were cleaning out the boxes of his stuff. There were letters and postcards from me that he’d saved, and letters he’d started writing to me but hadn’t finished. Some of the letters to me devolved into nonsense after a few pages. I couldn’t tell if he had been trying to be experimental in his writing or if it was because he was fighting his schizophrenia.</p>
<p><strong>Day 21</strong></p>
<p>I couldn’t sleep. Chris would feel me tossing and turning in bed next to him. He told me stories to get my mind off things. Sometimes he would get up, take my hand, lead me to the couch, and turn on the classic movie channel without saying anything. I’d watch, crying, until I fell asleep.</p>
<p><strong>Day 36</strong></p>
<p>I couldn’t eat. I lost 15 pounds quickly, even though I wasn’t exercising and I was certainly drinking too much alcohol. When I tried to eat I would be overwhelmed by nausea.</p>
<p>I went to a psychiatrist, who prescribed a lot of drugs. Effexor, Lamictal, Trazodone. They made me sleepy. I started calling out from work just to sleep for entire weekends. I still don’t know if it was just the sadness or the drugs that made me so exhausted.</p>
<p>My sister gave me a book to read, “No Time to Say Goodbye.” Her high school boyfriend had tried to kill himself. She understood to some extent what this was like.</p>
<p>Everyone else in my family tried politely to ignore that this momentous event had happened to me. I felt completely alone.</p>
<p><strong>Day 70</strong></p>
<p>I would be overwhelmed by sadness at random intervals throughout the day. I would start crying at my desk at work. I spent a lot of time in the bathroom, holed up in a stall. It was good to be out of the house, but I couldn’t concentrate on much. I had just started a master’s degree program for creative writing in New York City. We had started reading one of Adam’s favorite books. I couldn’t read it. I couldn’t write anything new. I brought old stories to my workshops. I went to class, I went to work, I went out with friends, but every time, I felt like a ghost.</p>
<p>I wanted to talk about Adam, to anyone who would listen. I called our 9th grade history teacher and told her what had happened. I called his high school girlfriend, who said she hadn’t thought of him in years. I would tell strangers on the subway about him. I was annoying in my classes at night, and when I would have a drink or two, I’d just devolve into tears. On New Year’s Eve, Chris and I went to a friend’s house for a party, and at midnight I sat on the stairs, bawling, trying to hide alone, away from these nice people I couldn’t be happy with.</p>
<p><strong>Day 285</strong></p>
<p>On what would have been Adam’s 25th birthday, Chris sent me flowers at work and a note saying, “I will always be there for you.” It was the kindest thing anyone has ever done for me.</p>
<p><strong>Day 366</strong></p>
<p>I stopped crying all the time. A year after Adam died I was able to sit in a bath and read his letters. I cried, but it wasn’t as desperate. I got a new job and was able to concentrate on work. My life had come back, without my noticing.</p>
<p>Part of me fantasized that somehow, he’d been recruited by the CIA and had to fake his own death. I thought maybe I’d run into him somewhere, some day, sure it was him. He’d have to pretend he didn’t know me and deny his identity, but he’d give me a sign, something only he and I would understand, so that I’d know he was okay. He’d let me know that he hadn’t destroyed my entire life without giving the act a second thought.</p>
<p>I re-read the blogs he’d written in the months before he’d died. When he’d written them, I’d thought they were satire. Now I saw them through a new lens and realized they were expressions of his descent into madness.</p>
<p>In some ways, it was a comfort to know that Adam’s suicide was due to schizophrenia. It was as if it hadn’t been him anymore — that he had been taken over by another person who believed that the police were coming to get him.</p>
<p><strong>Day 942</strong></p>
<p>Eventually Chris and I broke up. I finished my master’s degree, somehow, and moved home to New Mexico.</p>
<p>I quit taking the drugs because I couldn’t afford them without insurance. They were very hard to stop, even though I phased them down slowly, taking just a little bit less each day. I had brain zaps and mood swings. I gained weight. But I stopped being as sleepy. I felt less foggy.</p>
<p>I couldn’t write fiction anymore. Adam had been one of my muses. I tried to write letters to other friends, to start up something of a conversation like what Adam and I had once shared. There was nothing comparable. I felt like he’d taken all of that away from me.</p>
<p>I felt like he’d taken away my ability to trust that friendship mattered. How could he have done this to me? How could he have put me through this if he’d loved me? How could I ever believe that anyone I dared to love wouldn’t drag me through this again?</p>
<p>In my darkest moments, I reminded myself of the pain he’d caused me, and swore I’d never do that to anyone else. Or let anyone do it to me.</p>
<p><strong>Day 1,095</strong></p>
<p>Every year on October 26, I would light a candle to think of Adam. I would wish him happy birthday each August on social media.</p>
<p>I would get mad at him and scream at him when I was alone.</p>
<p>I would dream about him. He wouldn’t know he was dead. I wouldn’t tell him because I knew once he found out he’d be gone. But he would be gone when I woke up, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Day 2,190</strong></p>
<p>I became friends with his younger brother. We played kickball together. He was a veteran who had been in Iraq when Adam had died. We shared stories about him. We cried a lot.</p>
<p>I spent some time with Adam’s mother. At one point she told me that she and Adam’s father had always hoped Adam and I would end up together. This made me tear up, but it felt like a sort of peace. He had loved me, enough that his family knew who I was, and knew that I’d mattered.</p>
<p><strong>Day 3,653</strong></p>
<p>In October 2016, we marked 10 years since Adam’s passing. I decided to hold a seance to mark the occasion with Adam’s mother and his two younger brothers. I called around to local metaphysical shops until I found a woman who would perform the seance with a Ouija board. I followed her instructions and put salt around the perimeter of the house and burned sage in all the corners.</p>
<p>We sat around a square table in my living room. The guide “found” Adam. His mother and brothers took turns asking him questions. I took notes. “It’s so good to talk to you,” this Adam said. And it was for us.</p>
<p><strong>Day 3,943</strong></p>
<p>The thing about grief is that it never goes away; it just changes shape. Every death is different, even if they’re remarkably the same. I find solace in talking to people who have lost someone young, especially to suicide. We understand each other on a certain level, the ravages to our mental health, that others don’t. We know what it’s like to stare into an abyss of sadness and know that, in the morning, it won’t look quite as deep, as long as we can sit with it for as long as we need to.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Grief is one of the most intensely personal emotions we experience, and also one of the most public; not for nothing does every culture on Earth have rituals associated with grieving. Many of those rituals unfold over a series of days or months — Shiva in Jewish tradition, prayers in Buddhism — reflecting the fact that grief takes time. In a fast-paced society, there can be tremendous pressure to “get over it” as quickly as possible, and those who take more time than others may be viewed as suspect.</p>
<p>When does mourning cross the tipping point between a natural and healthy response to an intense life event and into something more dangerous? That’s a question that challenges researchers interested in a phenomenon called “complicated grief” or “difficult grief,” in which people become “stuck,” as <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/series-meet-our-therapists/" target="_blank">Talkspace therapist</a> Cynthia Stocker terms it. Whether an adjustment is related to the death of a loved one, the loss of a job, or another dramatic change like something that affects someone’s sense of identity, some people have difficulty processing and moving through their grief. It can become overwhelming, and that’s when grief may transition into something harmful.<span id="more-6562"></span></p>
<p>Grief is highly individualistic, and rarely follows a consistent trajectory. Despite <a href="http://www.ekrfoundation.org/five-stages-of-grief/" target="_blank">the five stages of grief</a> popularized by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, people don’t move through a series of emotions in an orderly process. They may experience anger, overwhelming sadness, dissociation, a “foggy head,” confusion, denial, bargaining, and other responses before moving into acceptance.</p>
<p>This may involve living with a loss, rather than moving “past” it; humans may remember and cherish those they have lost, especially at key anniversaries and events. Amanda Rausch, also a Talkspace therapist, said the first month tends to be the hardest, and that people experience “grief spikes” at three months, six months, a year, and other anniversaries like birthdays and wedding dates.</p>
<p>Grief is highly specific to the individual mourner. There’s no wrong or right way to process a loss, but Rausch said she generally sees a gradual progression in her patients. As people work through their grief, she said: “It’s still completely normal to have grief waves and grief spikes, but within the bad days, we have a good day, and another, and then an equal number, and then it’s mostly good.”</p>
<h2>What Causes Grief to Become Complicated?</h2>
<p>But what happens when grief doesn’t follow a natural progression into healing?</p>
<p>Rausch referred to “getting mired,” noting that in some people, grief becomes all-consuming. There are no good days, and the intensity of their feelings makes it difficult to perform even basic tasks of daily living — people can’t go to work, care for children, bathe and dress themselves, remember to eat, or take joy in life. They may develop <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a>, and experience extreme disassociation or confusion. “When you can’t take care of yourself,” she said, “that’s a warning sign.”</p>
<p>“We don’t have a diagnosis for grief. And that’s because we don’t want to create this as a disorder,” cautioned Stocker. There is no “timeline” for grief, and experts are wary about promoting the notion of “typical” or “normal” grief, as it could be used against grievers who don’t recover quickly from a loss. Instead, grievers need to be evaluated on an individual basis, and not pathologized when they do need some extra help.</p>
<p>A number of factors can affect the risk of complicated grief. A sudden or traumatic death can be harder for people to process, as can a disappearance — the sense of uncertainty can contribute to emotional struggle. People with preexisting depression may be at risk, as will those with their identities deeply wrapped around the thing, or person, they have lost. The surviving member of a couple married for 50 years, for example, may feel isolated and alone, while a dedicated athlete who experiences a traumatic injury that puts an end to competition may feel at sea, unsure of who she is without her connections to the sports world.</p>
<p>Stocker noted that sometimes losses can cascade, as well, referencing a patient who didn’t experience intense emotions after the death of a family member, but “fell apart” after a beloved pet died — the first loss intensified the second, exacerbating her patient’s emotions. She also commented that a loss that may seem minor, lesser, or unimportant to some people — like the loss of a job, or the death of a distant relative — could be very intense and personal for the griever. Judging people going through loss can stymie their recovery, she commented.</p>
<h2>How Therapy Can Help People Heal</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/going-to-therapy/" target="_blank">Going to therapy</a> can be helpful for anyone dealing with a loss, whether or not they’re experiencing complicated grief. The guidance of a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a> can be a powerful tool for exploring and working through loss in a safe environment. Both Stocker and Rausch stressed that the only way out of grief is through it, even though this process can be intense and at times overwhelming.</p>
<p>For those who do experience complicated grief, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a> is particularly important. “Seeing a therapist while you’re grieving doesn’t mean you’re broken,” Rausch said. <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_BOTTOM&amp;utr_adgroup=bottom-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002" target="_blank">Working with a therapist</a> can help people tackle the elements of their grief. This may involve exploring past traumas that have resurfaced, and developing coping skills for self-care while working through a loss.</p>
<h2>How to Help People When They Are Grieving</h2>
<p>But for those who are stuck in complicated grief, taking the step to start therapy can be incredibly challenging. Some people may feel they don’t need or won’t benefit from therapy, while others may struggle with tasks like picking up the phone to ask for help. This can be tough for friends to watch, Stocker said.</p>
<p>There are, however, things you can do to help. Rausch suggested people can help by finding a professional and connecting struggling friends or family members with them — even if that means making an appointment for them and making sure they show up, or downloading the Talkspace app and getting them set up. Both therapists stressed that people shouldn’t apply pressure like “don’t be sad” or “get over it,” instead validating feelings and supporting people by letting them know they’re loved and cared for.</p>
<p>In cases where depression is so extreme that loved ones are worried about the risk of suicide, Rausch said, it’s important to check in with offers of assistance and to keep doing so. It’s common, she said, for the first claim of “I’m fine, I don’t want to talk about it” to be taken at face value. While she advised respecting this assertion in the moment unless someone poses a clear risk to themselves or others, she said it’s necessary to keep reaching out — when people in her own life have struggled with grief, they later thanked her for being persistent.</p>
<p>The bottom line with grief is that it never fits neatly into a box. It’s messy, and dramatically different from person to person. Providing loving support — or asking for that support — helps people address grief, and some may need a little extra help if their feelings become so intense and overwhelming that they can’t function in ordinary life. That still shouldn’t be cause for shame or feelings of failure, though; it’s just part of the spectrum of ways humans respond to losses. All grief may be complicated, but complicated grief may call for intervention.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When people have a terminal illness and are journeying through their final days, they need lots of love and support from friends and family. Sometimes this isn’t enough, though.</p>
<p>Loved ones don’t necessarily have the skills or time to help someone come to terms with mortality. They might not know how to assist in making meaning of life as it is coming to an end.</p>
<p>This is when a psychotherapist or grief counselor can be invaluable. These mental health professionals have the skills to make patients and their loved ones as comfortable as possible during the end of a terminal illness.<span id="more-5288"></span></p>
<p>During her time working as a therapist in hospices, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/series-meet-our-therapists/" target="_blank">Talkspace therapist</a> <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/04/meet-our-therapists-samantha-white/" target="_blank">Samantha White</a> helped patients and their families navigate mental health issues related to death and closure.</p>
<p>Most patients were reluctant to talk about death, White said, that is until they began to worry about what their last moments would be like.</p>
<p>“Then I could tell them they had already been through the worst of it: the untreated illness, the tests, the treatments,” White said. “I could tell them death is not painful, that they will simply sleep more and more until they no longer woke up.”</p>
<p>White also assisted patients and family members in communicating everything they needed to, including thanking each other for being there and apologizing for anything they did to hurt one another. It was important for everyone to help the patient know he or she was a good person and lived a good life.</p>
<p>Family members tended to worry about the future, White said, so she helped them stay focused on the present. This allowed them to spend more quality time with their loved one before he or she passed.</p>
<p>“I have always taught that hospice is not about death,” White said. “It&#8217;s about maintaining quality of life.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all terminal patients have access to in-person counselors like White. They might not be in hospice or their hospital might not provide enough counselors to adequately care for them.</p>
<p>Even if working with a therapist is an option, affordability or insurance issues can get in the way. In the worst cases, the patient loses his or her ability to speak, making talk therapy impossible.</p>
<p>In these situations, video-based <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/" target="_blank">online therapy</a> or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/unlimited-messaging-therapy/" target="_blank">text-based therapy</a> can help terminal patients receive the mental health care they deserve. Patients can connect with a therapist any time they want. This can be especially useful when friends and family members are unable to be there.</p>
<p>If you are enduring a terminal illness, consider <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/" target="_blank">trying Talkspace</a>. It might work for you better than in-person therapy.</p>
<p>If you’re loved one has a terminal illness, a <a href="https://giftcard.talkspace.com/" target="_blank">Talkspace gift card</a> might help them make meaning of their life and be peaceful during their final days. Like White said, anything that helps maintain quality of life is worth it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemcneal/orlando-shooting-victims?utm_term=.qxBW2rpKy&amp;sub=4276504_8867765#.cclO9kJPo" target="_blank">Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo</a>, 20, walked into the Pulse Night Club on the night of June 11, he most likely thought it would be a normal evening. He would dance, socialize, maybe enjoy some of the live entertainment or Latin theme night. Then he would go home, sleep in and see his loved ones in the coming days.</p>
<p>Capo — and at least 49 other people — did not return. They lost their lives in the Orlando shooting, a senseless act of violence and the deadliest mass shooting in our country’s history.<span id="more-4501"></span></p>
<p>The news overwhelmed those who knew Capo with grief and confusion.</p>
<p>“Two weeks ago we spoke,” one of Capo’s friends wrote on social media, addressing him as if he were still alive. “You told me you were doing well. I wanted to come visit. I can’t even deal with this right now.”</p>
<p>Her words illustrated the feeling of loss many of the friends and family members of the victims felt, a burden they will carry for the rest of their lives. People they love lost their lives suddenly and in a horrific way. They could not say goodbye or prepare for the tragedy. The killer is dead, leaving an absence of closure and justice.</p>
<p>The shooting was a hate crime that targeted a gay club, a place where members of the LGBT community normally feel safe and open.</p>
<p>“It’s a feeling of that safety being violated,” said Nick Fager, a gay therapist who manages the <a href="http://kiptherapy.com/lgbtq/" target="_blank">LGBTQ services division</a> of a psychotherapy firm in New York. “We have so few places where we can feel that way.”</p>
<p>Coming together is one of the most effective ways to rebuild that sense of safety, Fager told Talkspace.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4502" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-4502 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/paris-orlando-support-secondary_300W_JR.jpg" alt="JE SUIS ORLANDO banner" width="300" height="183" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">a graphic activists in Paris are using to support the LGBT community in Orlando</figcaption></figure>
<p>Fortunately, the survivors, the victims’ loved ones, members of the LGBT community and other supporters are demonstrating strength and solidarity in the aftermath of this tragedy. People <a href="http://time.com/4365870/orlando-shooting-global-vigils/" target="_blank">around the world</a> — in cities and countries such as Toronto, London, Chicago, Paris, Sydney, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Australia — are holding vigils, rallies and memorials in response to this attack on the gay community.</p>
<p>The violation of a sense of safety, however, isn’t limited to the gay community. Mass shootings cause anxiety because they make people feel they could be a victim at any moment, that there is nothing they can do to negate the possibility of dying a horrible, unexpected death.</p>
<p>The anxiety also makes people think about the overwhelming amount of evil and tragedy in the world, causing some to become uneasy and unable to enjoy the positive aspects of their lives.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/series-meet-our-therapists/" target="_blank">Talkspace therapist</a> Jennifer Fuller Gerhart saw a client who fell into despair as she read article after article about the latest mass shooting.</p>
<p>“She had this question she couldn&#8217;t stop pondering: ‘Is there more good in the world or more bad?’ She felt totally overwhelmed by the hate she was reading about and couldn&#8217;t feel the love in her own life,” Gerhart said.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4503" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-4503" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/orlando-rally-secondary_300W_JR.jpg" alt="Orlando rally Minneapolis" width="300" height="169" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">a rally in Minneapolis held in the wake of the Orlando shooting</figcaption></figure>
<p>As Fager mentioned, one of the methods of fighting this feeling of overwhelming hate is coming together to help people experience love and empathy. Here are some ways you can support the gay community and the people who knew the victims of the Orlando shooting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support the victims of the shooting by <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/PulseVictimsFund" target="_blank">visiting their GoFundMe page</a> and donating to organizations that will help them.</li>
<li>Learn more about who <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemcneal/orlando-shooting-victims?utm_term=.mh1Meb5jg#.kjzwDKMP9" target="_blank">the victims</a> were. Honor their memory.</li>
<li>Attend a local vigil, memorial or rally (please consider your safety).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/OrlandoUnited" target="_blank">Support</a> the <a href="http://www.thecenterorlando.org/" target="_blank">LGBT community center</a> in Orlando.</li>
</ul>
<p>To cope with the feelings of grief and anxiety in the aftermath of the shooting, consider discussing the issues with a therapist. There are many therapists like Fager who specialize in <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/lgbt/" target="_blank">LGBT issues</a> and working with gay clients.</p>
<p>If you are not connected to the tragedy but are still experiencing anxiety, there are ways to look out for your mental health:</p>
<p><strong>Remind Yourself of the Good in the World</strong></p>
<p>Because mass shootings smother you with thoughts of how horrible the world can be, you need to look at the good in the world. Trying thinking about positive aspects of your life such as these:</p>
<ul>
<li>People care about you, love you and support you. They will be there for you during hard times. They will celebrate with you during good times.</li>
<li>Think about positive events and moments in your life. Maybe it was your first kiss, a day at an amusement park, a birthday or a graduation.</li>
<li>Look up some heartwarming stories that show the good and kindness in the world. It could be anything: a fireman saving a child, a dog bonding with a baby or a touching proposal.</li>
<li>Think about how lucky you are to be alive and safe. None of the evil in the world can touch you right now.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Take a Break from Social Media, TV and the News</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-4300 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cnn-news-secondary_300W_JR.jpg" alt="cnn news website" width="300" height="254" /></p>
<p>A temporary self-imposed ban on Facebook and other sources of news chatter can seem impossible during our age of non-stop social media. The benefits are worth it, though.</p>
<p>The media usually moves on after covering a mass shooting for a week or so. Limit social media use during that time so you can <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">reduce anxiety</a> and other <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/09/mental-health-effects-of-social-media-use/" target="_blank">mental health effects</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Live Your Life the Way You Normally Would: Don’t Let Fear Change You or the Gay Community</strong></p>
<p>If you withdraw and change your daily life after a mass shooting you weren’t involved in, you are allowing the evil in the world to rule you. It may be difficult, but you can process your feelings about mass shootings while continuing routines and other practices that protect your mental health. Remember, the chance of a terrorist attack affecting you is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/11/23/youre-more-likely-to-be-fatally-crushed-by-furniture-than-killed-by-a-terrorist/" target="_blank">statistically insignificant</a>.</p>
<p>The Orlando shooting was not only a physical assault. When people like the Orlando shooter terrorize us, they want us to feel afraid, anxious and ashamed. The horrific act was also an attempt to destroy the gay community’s pride and ability to feel safe.</p>
<p>If we don’t continue our lives and stand with the gay community, the Orlando shooter will have succeeded. We need to do our best to stop that from happening.</p>
