				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m 30 years old, and for many years, the longest relationship I had to date was in middle school — it lasted six months.</p>
<p>I was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/learning-cope-schizoaffective-disorder/" target="_blank">schizoaffective disorder</a> at age 19. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizoaffective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20354504" target="_blank">Schizoaffective disorder </a>is thought to be a unique combination of schizophrenia and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/bipolar-disorder-and-relationships/" target="_blank">a mood disorder like bipolar</a>, presenting with symptoms like difficulty communicating, episodes of depression, delusions, and even hallucinations. It presents differently from person to person, and there&#8217;s still a lot to be learned about it. Though it has negatively impacted my life in many ways, it&#8217;s been especially difficult to navigate in my social life.</p>
<p><span id="more-9139"></span></p>
<p>Before the onset of my mental illness, I was outgoing and had a vibrant social life. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/how-to-deal-with-multiple-mental-illnesses/" target="_blank">While I also always struggled with ADHD</a>, I had a lot of fun in high school. I was the captain of the high school football team and felt committed to my schoolwork. Nonetheless, schizoaffective disorder ultimately incapacitated me to the point where I couldn’t speak a coherent sentence, let alone carry on a conversation or complete routine day-to-day functions. The change was stark.</p>
<p>In my quest to recover my health and have a fuller life, I began talk therapy at age 25, and resolved to improve my cognitive abilities and start to define life goals. One of the goals that came up first was to be in a supportive relationship , and to one day have a family.</p>
<h2>Casual Dating with Mental Illness</h2>
<p>After two years of work on myself, I progressed to the point where I actually felt ready to &#8220;out myself out there&#8221; and go on dates. I had a full-time job and was saving money. I was 27 and still living at home which was a drawback, but my confidence was growing.</p>
<p>The first few dates I went on were fun and relatively laid-back. Deep down, though, I was drowning in insecurities. Because I had a reading disability, my job was an entry-level position in retail where I made very little money.  I was dating a woman who managed a retirement home, and was more connected to her &#8220;career&#8221; than I was to my day-job. There were countless things I worried about.</p>
<p>That relationship only lasted about two months. It ended with a text message from her in which she said I was a “nice guy,” but didn’t think we were going to work out. A lot of this outcome, I think, had to do with my social ineptitude from psychosis, which often left me literally speechless, caught in my own world without an ability to express myself. In moments of psychosis, I would open my mouth to speak, but nothing would come out. She sometimes would ask if I was OK and needed help. I didn’t tell her what I was experiencing because I thought she would respond by leaving me. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/mental-health-conditions-shouldnt-pejorative/" target="_blank">The stigma of mental illness is real</a>, after all.</p>
<h2>What Does Psychosis Look Like When Dating?</h2>
<p>Psychosis trapped me in my mind and made it difficult for me to be in the moment and present in the room. People would be talking, but it was a struggle to process any information. When my girlfriend and I were dating, there would be many occasions when she&#8217;d be expecting an answer, but I hadn’t even mentally digested what she was saying in the first place. She would eventually say something like, “Hello, are you even listening?” I would tell her yes but couldn’t recall what she had said because I had not finished analyzing it.</p>
<p>My slow comprehension definitely made for some awkwardness and contributed to the relationship not working. At the time, I wanted to blame my inability to date on factors like an inadequate job, or living at home at age 27. In reality, I simply wasn’t mentally healthy enough to be engaging with other people  romantically.</p>
<p>For the next year or so, I continued to work on my mental health in therapy with  a focus on improving my social skills. I soon started dating a friend, and began my first <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/11/long-distance-relationships-how-to-survive-and-thrive-in-the-ldr/" target="_blank">long-distance relationship. </a></p>
<p>Still, I had a lot to learn. The thing I realized is that love and life are constantly evolving. I had to continue learning and improving my relationship skills to keep up with folks for whom dating came more naturally.</p>
<h2>The Power of Honesty</h2>
<p>Six months into the relationship, I decided to tell her about my illness.</p>
<p>“I have something I need to tell you,” I said.</p>
<p>She looked at me with concern, and I choked up. I was terrified that my diagnosis would end the relationship. I couldn’t speak much at all, so I pulled up my phone and showed her my website that contained my writing about my schizoaffective diagnosis.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” she asked.</p>
<p>“It’s my website,” I said in a barely audible voice. “I have schizoaffective disorder.” My breathing began to seize up and I became tense.</p>
<p>“You do?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. I felt like a train was going to run me over.</p>
<p>“Oh, OK. Well that doesn’t matter,” she said.</p>
<p>I laughed a little. “It doesn’t?” I asked.</p>
<p>“No, not at all,” she said. “We need to get you a beer. This is too much stress. Come on. I’ll drive.”</p>
<p>After this conversation, I felt more at ease. I started disclosing more insecurities. At times, I might have opened up too much. About a week later, the relationship ended, but ironically, I don&#8217;t quite think it had anything to do with my diagnosis.</p>
<p>Because of schizoaffective disorder, I never matured at the same rate as my peers. Because I was dealing with psychosis in my early-to-mid-20s, I had been isolated from others and hadn&#8217;t practiced having social interactions with people my own age . During those years, I had lost track of what was socially acceptable to say and what wasn’t. Sometimes I would try to make jokes that weren’t relevant to the conversation we were having. My sense of humor needed to catch up with my age.</p>
<h2>The Education is Ongoing</h2>
<p>Looking back, I realized that this longer-term, long-distance relationship with my friend was a step in the right direction. It was a failure that opened new doors. The experience gave me confidence in who I am, and affirmed for me that I need to keep progressing with my health and education on dating.</p>
<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve spent time dating intermittently but not being in any real relationships. Today, I&#8217;m now a manager at a local butcher, and I live out on my own. I feel more secure about who I am, although I still fixate on my inadequacies, just like anyone else — like the fact that I don&#8217;t make a lot of money.</p>
<p>Being in therapy, I am learning I also learned I had a lot of confusion as to what I wanted and identify more clearly what kind of relationship I&#8217;m looking for, and what kind of person I want to be. I&#8217;ve asked myself what love is and learned that, for me, love is aboutmaking sacrifices for the overall happiness of both people in the relationship. Mental illness or not, this is a commitment I&#8217;ve made as I continue to work on myself.</p>
<p>I may have schizoaffective disorder, but other people have challenges they deal with, too. It&#8217;s the imperfections that give us all value and define who we are.</p>
<p>For a while, I was looking for the perfect woman. A friend then told me, &#8220;None of us are right and none of us are wrong, some of us are just more right for each other than others.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true, and believing that requires that we accept ourselves more in the process. When I previously felt diffident in my ability to date and have a relationship, redefining what I was looking for gave me the strength I needed to accept myself and make changes in my life based on what supports my well-being. That, to me, is part of the foundation of finding real, sustainable love.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was sleeping on a tile floor during a New England winter with very little heat and no blankets. I starved to the point where I lost too much weight. After all this chaos I was hospitalized at Portsmouth Regional Hospital where the staff diagnosed me with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/schizophrenia/" target="_blank">schizophrenia</a>, specifically schizoaffective disorder.</p>
<p>During my first episode of schizoaffective disorder, I experienced psychosis to the point where I had difficulty speaking more than several words at a time. I had referential thinking and lost my ego boundary. Everything external and internal blended together.</p>
<p>I believed there was a telekinetic network and my thoughts were being disseminated to everyone in the world.<span id="more-8410"></span></p>
<p>The meaning of this diagnosis was something I repudiated at first. I didn’t accept as an inherent part of who I was. At first it made me think I was weird and different than everyone else. I didn’t like feeling that I was separate from those who were healthy and “normal.” My self-perception at the time was that I was kind of a weird person, so hearing this diagnosis reinforced that notion.</p>
<p>As I grew older and out of the awkward stages of my early and mid-twenties, it became easier to separate myself from the illness. When I became more comfortable with who I was, I was able to think of my mental health condition as not one and the same as my personality. This new mindset allowed me to compartmentalize the diagnosis into a series of symptoms.</p>
<p>Another issue I faced was that I attributed everything — all that horror — that had happened in college to schizophrenia. I felt that if I disclosed the diagnosis, that would immediately reveal all the embarrassing moments I had experienced from my episodes; all the chaos, psychosis, and disorientation. I was also nervous about meeting new people. It’s strange to say, but I didn’t realize when first meeting new people that they didn’t already know all about my condition. I also assumed that everyone who had schizophrenia had exactly the same experience.</p>
<p>In later years I realized the only commonalities are some of the symptoms. Sufferers experience auditory and visual hallucinations, referential thinking, speech impairment, and psychosis. When I <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/disclose-mental-health-issues-not/" target="_blank">disclose</a> my mental illness, it’s simply a series of symptoms that I’ve been dealing with. It’s the same as any other diagnosis.</p>
<p>The other issue I struggled with when diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder was the stigma surrounding the diagnosis. At first I actually imagined it might be cool, a label that set me apart. Maybe the idea came from watching too much TV.</p>
<p>After the dust cleared from my second episode, however, I realized this diagnosis was a huge problem for a number of reasons. I struggled to socialize and interact with new acquaintances. People would joke about mental health conditions, and it was difficult for me to cope with because I took it personally. Hearing people disparage those with mental illness was painful.</p>
<p>It hurt because it felt like they were talking about me. I also couldn’t stand up for myself because I worried my friends wouldn’t want to spend time with me if I disclosed my diagnosis or defended others with mental illness. The stigma against mental illness is still strong and I felt it acutely.</p>
<p>After disclosing my illness to about five or six friends, I realized that the good people in my life didn’t care about schizoaffective disorder diagnosis. Disclosing the illness actually strengthened some of my relationships — people knew the reasons I was socially awkward at times. They became more accepting. And the disclosure also acted as a useful test — who would actually want to be friends with someone who was so closed minded as to discriminate against those with mental health challenges?</p>
<p>As far as feeling that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx_klWiebps" target="_blank">mental health stigma</a> kept people from associating with the mentally ill, I realized this was more about my own insecurity, my own unhealthy or irregular thoughts and behaviors. Friends who know I have schizoaffective disorder are always tactful when they talk about <a href="https://twitter.com/talkspace?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank">mental health</a>, and they come to me as a resource when they, or someone they know, is going through a tough time. I learned that most of the disparagement against those with mental illness came from a lack of education. It wasn’t necessarily even malicious.</p>
<p>My diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is simply a statement of symptoms. These mental health issues have nothing to do with who I am. I like to say that if someone has a cold, this doesn’t mean they have a sick personality or they’re a bad person.</p>
<p>For the first several years of recovery I hated to think about the diagnosis because of all the symptoms I was suffering from. As I became healthier, however, I was more comfortable with the diagnosis because it wasn’t impacting my daily life. As I made progress with therapy, I gained control over the illness alleviated the fears I had initially. The progress made my symptoms more manageable and easier to talk about. I finally had control of my life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Schizophrenia is perhaps the most misunderstood of all mental illnesses, mostly due to the sheer amount of misinformation out there. Some of this is due to movies and TV, while some can be attributed to stereotypes about mental illness. There are several cultural and demographic myths regarding schizophrenia — these are the four most common.</p>
<h2>Myth #1: People with Schizophrenia All Have the Same Symptoms</h2>
<p>There are many different types of schizophrenia, and they can all affect a person in different ways. Symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia, such as delusions that someone is out to get the sufferer, are different from <a href="http://www.schizlife.com/catatonic-schizophrenia-what-is-it/" target="_blank">catatonic schizophrenia symptoms</a>, which include a lack of emotion and decreased motivation.</p>
<p>Mental illnesses affect people differently. It is possible to encounter two sufferers with the same type of schizophrenia who behave differently. Schizophrenia isn&#8217;t all about being paranoid and hearing voices.<span id="more-6621"></span></p>
<h2>Myth #2: Women are More Likely to Have Schizophrenia than Men</h2>
<p>Although some people believe women are more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses than men, studies show that the rate of schizophrenia is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1636807" target="_blank">two to three times higher</a> in men than women. This could be because <a href="http://time.com/2928046/mental-health-services-women/" target="_blank">women are more likely to seek out treatment</a> for their mental health than men, but also because there are genetic components of the disorder as well.</p>
<p>This myth has some unfortunate implications and side effects. Schizophrenia is a serious illness that requires treatment and medication. Men and women who do not receive this treatment are more likely to become a danger to themselves and others. There is still a serious <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/men-dont-deal-mental-health/" target="_blank">stigma in our culture against men who seek help</a> for their mental health issues. This barrier can lead to severe consequences when men do not receive the treatment and therapy they need.</p>
<h2>Myth #3: People with Schizophrenia have Multiple Personalities</h2>
<p>This is another myth that refuses to die. In fact, according to a <a href="https://www.nami.org/schizophreniasurvey" target="_blank">2008 study</a> by the National Alliance on Mental Illness, 64% of people still believe schizophrenia means having multiple personalities. While people with multiple personalities do exist, most do not live with schizophrenia. The condition people are actually thinking about is called dissociative identity disorder (previously multiple personality disorder).</p>
<p>Part of the reason why people believe schizophrenia is the same as dissociative identity disorder is because schizophrenia derives from a Greek word meaning &#8220;split mind.&#8221; The &#8220;split mind&#8221; aspect refers to how people with schizophrenia have minds that tend to isolate them from the rest of the world, as if they were split off. The phrase doesn&#8217;t mean the mind itself is split.</p>
<h2>Myth #4: People with Schizophrenia are Dangerous</h2>
<p>Thanks in part to movies, TV, and other forms of pop culture that portray all people with mental illness as unpredictable criminals and killers, this is one of the most common myths about schizophrenia. The vast majority of those who live with the illness aren&#8217;t violent at all. According to studies of people with schizophrenia who have committed violent crimes, only <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/lhb-0000075.pdf" target="_blank">23%</a> of those offenses were directly related to their symptoms.</p>
<h2>The Reality</h2>
<p>With proper treatment and medication, it is possible to live a full life with schizophrenia. Many famous people such as football star and sports analyst Lionel Aldridge, former Fleetwood Mac guitarist Peter Green, and mathematician John Nash have all lived with schizophrenia. Life was often difficult for them, yet they learned to thrive.</p>
<p>There is hope for those who live with this frightening yet misunderstood condition. By combatting the stigma of the illness, we can help them be at peace and free of judgment.</p>
<p><em>Bio: Mike Jones is a health and fitness writer. He hopes people will stop stigmatizing others dealing with a mental illness and start fighting against common schizophrenia misconceptions.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although the popular perceptions of schizophrenia have changed, the mental health disorder — it’s not classified as a disease, as it can’t be verified as a physical condition — is still not clearly understood outside of the medical profession. This is largely due to the fact that schizophrenia is a complex condition that can manifest as a wide variety of symptoms in different people. To complicate things further, symptoms can also differ in individuals at different stages of the disorder.</p>
<p>The cause of schizophrenia is unknown. Although there are various theories, it’s generally diagnosed when symptoms meet the standard definition of the disorder, and when other similar conditions — such as <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/bipolar-disorder/" target="_blank">bipolar disorder</a> — have been rejected.<span id="more-6528"></span></p>
<h2>Delusions and Hallucinations</h2>
<p>Schizophrenia is a severe, long-term mental health disorder that doctors classify as a kind of psychosis. This means that sufferers can’t correctly perceive what is going on in the world around them, and interpret events that are occurring in a different way than others. Symptoms may involve hallucinations, delusions, an inability to feel emotions or pleasure, and disorganized thinking, among others. The disorder usually appears in those in their teens and twenties, although it can show up in those in their thirties (more often in women).</p>
<p>Schizophrenia can be hereditary, and around 10 percent of people whose first-degree relatives are sufferers are affected. The disorder can’t be cured, but the symptoms can be managed to the point that sufferers can, for instance, hold a job, and maintain relationships. Recent research points to a cause that is both genetic and environmental, and treatment usually involves a combination of antipsychotic drugs and cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>
<h2>Paranoia and Disorganization</h2>
<p>As the root cause of the disorder is unknown, schizophrenia is best understood by its <a href="https://psychcentral.com/disorders/schizophrenia/schizophrenia-symptoms/" target="_blank">symptoms</a>. There are two main subtypes of schizophrenia — the paranoid subtype and the disorganized sub-type. The paranoid subtype suffers from auditory hallucinations — “hearing voices” — or delusional thoughts, or both, relating to persecution and conspiracy. The sufferer often thinks that a person, or a group of people — often family members — are “out to get” him or her.</p>
<p>The hallucinations revolve around a specific theme, which usually remains constant for the sufferer, and the individual’s actions generally relate to the content of this theme. The brain of a person suffering from schizophrenia mistakes the thought of a voice giving instructions as a real voice.The voices appear to be genuine to the sufferer. Delusions include the thought that, for instance, people talking on television are sending special messages, or giving instructions, to the sufferer.</p>
<p>The feelings of persecution can lead to hostility toward others, although those experiencing schizophrenia are rarely violent. As the condition progresses, memory and mental coherency can suffer. One problem is sufferers might not talk about their auditory hallucinations, so the disorder may be difficult to spot in the early stages. The paranoid subtype can more easily be treated, and sufferers can stabilize to a level where they can work, have relationships, and lead relatively normal lives.</p>
<p>The disorganized subtype suffers from disorganization of the thought process — sufferers become muddled and confused. This subtype experiences less pronounced hallucinations and delusions, but may not be able to think clearly enough to function normally. They might not, for instance, wash or perform other acts of personal hygiene. The sufferer will lose the ability to experience emotions, a condition which is called the “blunted” or <a href="https://psychcentral.com/encyclopedia/flat-affect/" target="_blank">“flat” affect</a>, and may respond in an inappropriately cheerful manner to events, for example, by laughing at a funeral. Communication becomes difficult, and speech becomes garbled, with words being used in the wrong order. This is sometimes referred to as “word salad.”</p>
<h2>Nature and Nurture</h2>
<p>What <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Schizophrenia/Pages/Causes.aspx" target="_blank">causes</a> schizophrenia? The root cause is unknown. Environmental, biological and, more recently, genetic causes have been explored. Some researchers believe that there is an environmental element — a virus, or malnutrition in the womb — that works in conjunction with genetic or biological factors to cause the condition. The focus until recently has generally been biological, and dopamine has been the subject of much investigation.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/07/what_is_dopamine_love_lust_sex_addiction_gambling_motivation_reward.html" target="_blank">Dopamine</a> is a chemical that works as a neurotransmitter in the brain — that is, it’s used to send signals to nerve cells. When drugs like clozapine are used to block dopamine, schizophrenia patients see an improvement. This has led to the suggestion that schizophrenia sufferers may produce too much dopamine, and this may be a cause of the condition. NMDA receptors — receptors that are found in nerve cells and are activated when glutamates bind to them — have also been considered as a cause.</p>
<h2>Genes May Hold the Key</h2>
<p>Recent research, however, has focused on genetics, with one influential study cataloguing 108 genes that are implicated in causing schizophrenia. <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2075495-overactive-brain-pruning-in-teens-could-cause-schizophrenia/" target="_blank">Another important study</a> focused on a specific gene, C4, as a specific cause of schizophrenia. The C4 gene is involved in the immune system. In the blood, it binds to microbes to signal that they should be engulfed by cells of the immune system, and therefore destroyed.</p>
<p>In the brain, C4 has a different purpose, and binds to neurons at the points where they connect to other neurons. This is to signify that the connection between the neurons (called the synapse) should be engulfed and destroyed. Schizophrenia often first appears in teenagers due to a developmental phase in the brain at this age when the synapses are pruned. Researchers believe that schizophrenia could be a result of the C4 gene marking too many synapses for pruning. This is an exciting step forward, and more research is being carried out on the C4 gene. If a root cause for schizophrenia is discovered, it’s possible that a cure can be found.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, doctors continue to manage the symptoms in patients with schizophrenia by using a combination of drugs and cognitive behavioral therapy. “Typical” antipsychotic drugs like chlorpromazine have been used to treat schizophrenia since the 1950s, although these can have side effects like movement disorders. “Atypical antipsychotic” drugs like clozapine are used if patients fail to respond to typical antipsychotic drugs. Clozapine works by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain. It’s effective, but it must be closely monitored, as a side effect can be a dangerously low white blood cell count.</p>
<h2>Therapy Aids Recovery</h2>
<p>Psychosocial <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a> can aid patients whose conditions have stabilized due to the use of antipsychotic medication. Therapists can encourage schizophrenia patients to stick with their medication, and can help with a patient’s self-management of the disorder, their relationships, and integration into society (like employment).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/schizophrenia/abcs-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-schizophrenia" target="_blank">Cognitive behavioral therapy</a>, which focuses on solving the current problems of a patient by breaking them down into smaller parts that can then be analyzed, can help schizophrenia sufferers work out whether their perceptions are true representations of the outside world. Therapy is an important part of the management process for schizophrenics.</p>
