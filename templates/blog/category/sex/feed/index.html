				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Noted hip-hop philosophers Salt-N-Pepa <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydrtF45-y-g" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">once sang</a>, <i>“Let’s talk about sex baby / Let’s talk about you and me / Let’s talk about all the good things / And the bad things that may be.” </i></p>
<p>They were definitely onto something. Talking about sex isn’t always easy, but seldom does the best sex happen without some sort of communication. Now, for a lot of people, asking for what they want in bed is no walk in the park. But ask someone who has pushed through and communicated even if they felt awkward doing so, and while they may say “yes,” they’ll likely also tell you it’s well worth it.</p>
<p><span id="more-10606"></span></p>
<h2>Why Healthy Sex-Talk With Your Partner is Important</h2>
<p>There’s no denying <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/sex/">sex</a> is a significant facet of many relationships, no matter if a couple is new or years into a partnership.</p>
<p><b>“</b>For many [sex is] the cornerstone of intimacy within the relationship,” Talkspace therapist Rachel O’Neill, Ph.D., says<b>.</b> “Being open, honest, and vulnerable is important to the long-term success of the relationship. It’s not fair to expect your partner to read your mind.”</p>
<p>In addition to depriving yourself of maximum pleasure, having unfulfilling sex with your partner can put a damper on your relationship. And if there’s a damper on your relationship, it’s probably going to affect your daily life.</p>
<p>“Feeling inhibited sexually can put a strain on your emotional and mental well-being,” O’Neill explains. “When you’re comfortable discussing sexual needs, it’s generally reflective of having a stronger relationship with your partner. Individuals who feel sexually unfulfilled may notice that they are more irritable and frustrated with their partner.”</p>
<h2>Using Communication to Eliminate Frustration and Resentment</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nobascholar.com/chapters/10/download.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Studies show</a> that there’s a correlation between romantic relationships and overall well being. It’s not just about <i>being</i> in a relationship, though. It’s about being satisfied with the relationship’s quality, and yes, that includes being satisfied with the sex you’re having.</p>
<p>You should also ask yourself how comfortable you are communicating with your partner in general about topics other than sex, because <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/guide-setting-healthy-boundaries-relationships/" target="_blank">great communication</a> is absolutely essential in relationships. While you may be able to easily “read” somebody the better you get to know them, there’s no substitute for clear, specific verbal communication when it comes to sex or other topics.</p>
<p>“Over time, frustration and resentment might build within the relationship. It’s possible that not feeling comfortable communicating your sexual needs may be reflective of a larger relationship concern,” O’Neill stresses. “How comfortable are you discussing sensitive or potentially uncomfortable topics with your partner? Do you shy away from deeper discussion in favor of more surface-level conversations?”</p>
<p>She adds, “Individuals who are reluctant to communicate their sexual needs may also be reluctant to communicate about other relationship needs too, which may in turn impact other aspects of the relationship.”<br />

<h2>Learn to Understand Your Partner’s Sexual Needs and Limits</h2>
<p>The saying “different strokes for different folks” has another, very literal meaning when it comes to sex.</p>
<p>What works in bed for some certainly doesn’t work for others. Some people have “hard-nos” when it comes to sex, and there’s nothing wrong with that. You don’t have to be willing to perform <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/11/has-your-sex-life-simmered-down-heres-how-to-reignite-it/" target="_blank">every sexual act</a>, live out every fantasy, or try out every kink your partner is interested in. But you <i>do </i>have to talk about it all if you want to make it work, even if you feel a little (or very) embarrassed talking about your likes and dislikes in the bedroom.</p>
<p>“It’s okay to feel uncomfortable or embarrassed <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/sexual-self-worth-more-than-just-sex/" target="_blank">talking about sex</a>. Many individuals are raised to view sex as taboo. Generally, the more you talk about your sexual needs, the more comfortable you become with the topic,” Rachel O’Neill urges. “If you’re too embarrassed to begin the conversation you can start by writing down your thoughts and asking your partner to read them.”</p>
<p>“You can also start small and work your way up to talking about larger needs,” O’Neill continues. “For example, you might begin by talking with your partner about a new position you’d like to try or a role-play that you’re interested in acting out. Once you open the door to having more honest and straightforward conversations around sex, you might find you’re more comfortable discussing other sexual needs.”</p>
<p>Hey, who knows, you might also find you’re more comfortable talking about your future, your fears, your dreams, and everything in between!</p>
<h2>The Next Steps to a Healthy Sex Life With Your Partner</h2>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve got these tips, why not get started tonight? Open dialogues will lead to open doors in <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/is-your-relationship-balanced-boring/" target="_blank">your relationship</a>, and improvement in your overall well being. Sometimes, communication can be just as sexy as sex.</p>
<p>A partner who knows what they want and how to talk about it? That’s hot.</p>
<p>If you’re having trouble communicating with your partner, or need a neutral party to roleplay the conversation, an <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_POST_INLINE&amp;utr_adgroup=how-not-expressing-your-needs-in-bed-harms-your-mental-health&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/mental-health-harms-not-expressing-needs-in-bed/" target="_blank">individual or couples therapist</a> can provide solutions to help you reclaim your healthy sex life!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s a friday night, you’re getting cozy with your partner and zoning out while surfing the latest feeds on your smartphone. They lean in for a kiss, then a grope; you can sense the next step. Your anxiety skyrockets: heart beating fast and breath becoming more rapid. Repetitive thoughts start spiraling: What do they want from me? Why is work stress popping up now? Will I perform well in bed? What if I can’t keep an erection or climax?</p>
<p>We have so many strategies that allow us to zone out easily during relaxed moments, but when sex or physical affection is presented, our bodies must suddenly engage in the present moment. This presence often brings a flood of thoughts and feelings from the day, or those sparked by sex in general. For someone struggling with anxiety or depression, this flood of negativity prevents us from connecting with our partner and enjoying sex and pleasure in the ways we might like.</p>
<p>Fear not! We have some thoughts and tools to support you in shifting this pattern.</p>
<p><span id="more-10198"></span></p>
<h2>How Mental Health Impacts Sex</h2>
<p>Despite our best efforts, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/sex/" target="_blank">sex</a> is highly impacted by mental health and overall well-being. We could talk for days about why, but in simple terms, your whole self is involved in connecting; sex is both a physical, emotional, and psychological process. Your bodies engage, feelings spill over, and thoughts about your past and present sexual experiences can pop in.</p>
<p>When you struggle with anxiety or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/dealing-depression-need-know/">depression</a> these symptoms commonly escalate when under stress, and prevent you from moving towards sexual situations in general. These patterns play out in all types of relationships and partners, including casual, long term, queer, straight, and non-binary identified individuals and couples. Here’s a few specific ways the symptoms manifest.</p>
<h3>Anxiety’s Impact on a Healthy Sex Life</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/anxiety-attack-vs-panic-attack-one/" target="_blank">Anxiety</a> commonly involves symptoms like panic, trouble breathing, nausea, over thinking, and avoidance. As you might imagine, panic or nausea during sex is less than sexy. Even worse, it can result in shutting down or disconnecting during sex itself, which prevents enjoyable sensations or feelings.</p>
<p>When that happens sex becomes associated with compliance or lack of pleasure, and perpetuates the cycle of avoidance or reduced desire. Maintaining erections and achieving orgasm becomes difficult and leads to further frustration and disconnection. While there is so much pleasure potential outside of erections and orgasms, being in a head space to be creative and open to other kinds of touch and connection may be inhibited too.</p>
<h3>Depression’s Impact on a Healthy Sex Life</h3>
<p>Similarly, depression symptoms such as sadness, lethargy, hopelessness, withdrawal, and isolation inhibit our ability to be available to connect and our awareness of sexual desire. As sexuality researcher <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Come-You-Are-Surprising-Transform/dp/1476762090" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Emily Nogoski</a> explains, desire is a motivation system, not a drive or biologically determined concept as we commonly believe libido to be. Shifting this understanding of desire can help us manage the ways that depression and anxiety impact desire by impacting motivation. Ask yourself, what might increase my motivation for sex when I’m having a hard time? How might my partner do things to turn me on, that won’t make the symptoms worse?</p>
<p>One exacerbating factor in managing these symptoms is being a person who identifies as gay, queer, gender non-conforming, or non-binary. These identities carry with them stigma, shame, and oppression from others, which is so tough to manage while trying to navigate complex relationship dynamics. If the individual is also receiving hormone therapy and seeking new ways to engage with their genitals and partners, the anxiety and depression symptoms can make this exploration and adaptation much harder.</p>
<p>So what are some strategies?!</p>
<h2>Strategies for Enjoying Sex While Dealing With Anxiety and Depression</h2>
<p>First, there are some worries at times about using sex as a tool for managing symptoms. Rest assured this is generally not a problem. Sex is a healthy, as well as physically, emotionally, psychologically rewarding experience when done consensually and in ways that maximize <a href="http://www.theharveyinstitute.com/about-us/what-is-sexual-health" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">sexual health</a>.</p>
<p>Balancing other ways to manage symptoms can be a good strategy if you’re concerned about the frequency of sex seeking behaviors, such as exercise, spending time with friends, writing, or seeing a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a>. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Talkspace</a> can be a really great way to check in daily and get long-term tools and interventions for managing symptoms.</p>
<p>If lack of desire or motivation for sex is the biggest challenge, it can be helpful to start integrating mindfulness into your coping strategies. This can include slowing down, breathing deeply, and noticing what is happening in your body in the moment. Taking a minute to calm, sometimes doing a visualization or physical movement such as a walk or a few minutes of movement can shift the cycling of symptoms. Let your partner know what is happening and ask for their support if possible; they want sex, so supporting you in the ways you need will help them get their needs met also.</p>
<p>If you can, identify the stuck thought or feeling that is repetitive, name it, and reframe it. What other story can you tell yourself about what is happening in your brain or body? For example, instead of “I am going to fail so I can’t have sex right now” you can repeat “I’m going to try my best and my partner cares about me either way.”</p>
<p>Lastly, redefining sex can ease some of the pressure that impacts symptoms. If you define sex as connection and pleasure, it opens the door to all types of touch and fun, regardless of the ways your body may be shutting down. For example, your genitals aren’t ready to engage, but a hot makeout and snuggle would feel really good.</p>
<h2>Manage Your Symptoms for a Better Sexual Experience</h2>
<p>Instead of needing to zone out, you can integrate symptom management into the ways you engage physically and increase your opportunities for pleasure, connection, and feeling better overall.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If the thought of sharing the nitty gritty details of your sex life with a stranger is enough to kill your libido, well, I don’t blame you. Trust me, I remember how insanely awkward I felt the first time I bought up something sex related to my therapist!</p>
<p>While opening up about such an intimate topic to <i>anyone </i>can be awkward, coming clean about the issues you’re dealing with to a therapist can be super-beneficial to your sex life. After mustering up the courage to bring up the awkward sex talk with your therapist, you can reap big-time benefits. Here are 5 ways <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a> can help improve your sex life, as told by 5 people who have experienced it first hand.</p>
<p><span id="more-10127"></span></p>
<h2>1. Overcoming Trauma</h2>
<p>Trauma is hard to overcome and can have long-lasting effects. Hannah,* 27, was sexually abused as a child. It took her 6 months with a therapist to really share everything — and it was worth it. She openly shared painful details of her abuse, and her therapist helped her to realize none of it was her own fault. Additionally, she was given some helpful homework.</p>
<p>“My <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a> started challenging me to do little things, like initiate touch with ‘safe’ people. I had to make a list of people who I felt safe with and my homework was to do something like clap them on the shoulder or give them a hug,” she recounts. “I hated that stuff at first and I kept avoiding it. But eventually I started doing it, and it became easier.”</p>
<p>Now, Hannah’s in a romantic relationship and able to take steps she never has before. “It was like pulling teeth before. Now it’s a lot more fun.”</p>
<h2>2. Regaining Control of Your Sexuality</h2>
<p>Throughout life, you may experience downfalls or hardships that can make you feel like you’ve lost control of your own body and sexuality, and that can be a lot to overcome! Amanda,* 30, dealt with both sexual trauma and medical issues that left her feeling defeated when it came to sex. After a pelvic surgery retriggered her rape PTSD symptoms, she headed to a therapist.</p>
<p>“I sought therapy to ‘fix’ myself, although I had no idea what that would look like or if it would even work,” she confesses. “Therapy plus <a href="https://www.rolf.org/rolfing.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">rolfing</a> plus some other pelvic pain techniques helped me regain control of my body; learning grounding techniques helped me get back to myself during dissociation spells.”</p>
<p>She adds, “I’ve regained some semblance of control over my body, brain, and sensuality and am now able to have a full sex life without being terrified of getting triggered during a sexual encounter.”</p>
<h2>3. Building Confidence</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/sexual-self-worth-more-than-just-sex/" target="_blank">Self esteem</a> can play a big part in sex drive and quality of sex. Not to mention, if you don’t have great self confidence, it’s going to be a lot harder for you to get out there and date, let alone have sex.</p>
<p>Caroline,* 25, had low self esteem and severe social anxiety. Her best friend convinced her to make an appointment with the campus counselor, and things went uphill from there. “Soon, I was much more comfortable at parties and bars. It was like my thoughts became more organized and I could control it all a little better,” she explains.</p>
<p>“The following semester, I had the confidence to pursue hookups, feel comfortable taking some sexy selfies, and score a friend with benefits,” she said. I was always pretty shy and modest before, but I was able to see through my thinking and become more of who I wanted to be. If I never made that appointment in the health center, who knows if I would have ever made those changes.”</p>
<h2>4. Learning to Communicate Better</h2>
<p>When it comes to sexual and romantic relationships, communication is key. Adam,* 24, says learning about proper communication helped him build up his libido.</p>
<p><b>“</b>Mostly just working through my <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/dealing-depression-need-know/" target="_blank">depression</a> and childhood trauma has allowed me to be more in tune with my sexuality and figure out what makes me tick and how to communicate, which led to being able to channel all of that better,” he shares.</p>
<p>Sometimes, <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150212065133.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">depression is linked to communication issues</a>. Working through depression and its effects with a therapist can help you understand yourself better and build up skills that can change the way you talk to people — sexual partners or not. You may also learn how to be more effective with your conversations with friends, family, and coworkers. It’s a win-win situation!</p>
<h2>5. Coping with Sexual Dysfunction</h2>
<p>Sexual dysfunction is a common concern within sex therapy, but you can certainly bring it up to a general therapist as well. While many people feel ashamed of their dysfunction, coming clean to a therapist can help a lot. Taylor,* 24, has <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anorgasmia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369422" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">anorgasmia</a> — which means she does not orgasm.</p>
<p>After a few years of suffering in silence, she told her therapist about her issue. “My therapist gave me homework and exercises to do by myself to get more in touch with my body and sexuality. She is also teaching me to accept my condition and stop beating myself up for it, since I often feel broken and lesser than other women due to my inability to orgasm,” she says. “I’m learning to focus more on feelings and sensations rather than just the end goal of orgasming. It’s hard work, but I’m getting there.”</p>
<h2>It’s OK to Seek Help for Sex-Related Issues</h2>
<p>There you have it! If you feel like your sex life is less than ideal, there is hope for you! Therapists are trained to deal with issues like this, and there’s a good chance they’ve helped someone in the exact same situation as you. So take a chance and <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_POST_INLINE&amp;utr_adgroup=5-ways-therapy-can-improve-your-sex-life?utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/ways-therapy-can-improve-sex-life" target="_blank">share your thoughts with a therapist</a> — it’ll be worth it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My boyfriend and I lay in bed, his fingers twirling my chest hair as we talked about our plans for hysterectomies. I told him I saw the procedure as a safeguard against a worst case scenario. Hearing this, he looked so anguished, I nearly felt guilty.</p>
<p>“It makes me sad that you worry about that happening again” he said.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I told my 12-step sponsor about surviving sexual assault. He said we can’t resolve some experiences, we can only share our stories to help others realize they’re not alone. In other words, we can say, “me, too.”</p>
<p>Since getting sober in 2013, I’ve heard stories from several sexual assault survivors and I’ve told my own. Men don’t often discuss sexual assault or mental health, and while it’s not easy to share my story, I believe it’s crucial.</p>
<p><span id="more-10108"></span></p>
<h2>My Story</h2>
<p>It happened a few months before I got sober.</p>
<p>He was an acquaintance, and like all of my acquaintances at the time, our relationship was defined by our mutual affinity for substance use. I was 21 and he was about 15 years older. He was stocky, blond, and clean-shaven. I never knew his last name.</p>
<p>One afternoon, we sat together under a bridge. Although I hadn’t found him attractive, as the rush of euphoria overtook my senses, I stared into his eyes and felt profound joy and affection. I kissed him. He kissed me back.</p>
<p>By nightfall, he had found a bottle of whiskey. Though I didn’t need encouragement, he urged me to keep drinking.</p>
<p>The next thing I recall, I was pressed up against a parked car in the dark. After another memory gap, we were atop the air mattress in my sparsely-furnished bedroom. The ceiling spun above him and I only remember thinking, “I can’t wait for this to be over.”</p>
<p>Maybe the gaps in my memory are for the better. But they’re frustrating because some stubborn part of me believes if I can determine exactly what happened, then I can prevent it from happening again.</p>
<h2>Reliving the Trauma</h2>
<p>A week later, I told — and believed — my <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/08/the-different-types-of-therapists-and-counselors-the-complete-guide/">therapist</a> it was another bad hook-up. Then, I told my acquaintance I didn’t want to do that again.</p>
<p>His reply felt like a knife to my throat.</p>
<p>“Don’t go accusing me of rape,” he said.</p>
<p>I didn’t. Not in our conversation and not afterward. But he soon left town, after gifting me a romantic letter and a bracelet, too feminine for my taste. Though I’d come out as a trans man, most people in my life disregarded this and treated me as a woman.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, I completely forgot what happened. I didn’t remember until I’d been sober for over six months.</p>
<p>In the meantime, my mind latched onto desperate attempts to prevent another assault. Consumed with paranoia, I berated my housemates about keeping the doors locked. While a buddy and I watched a horror movie with a rape scene, I felt suddenly nauseous without knowing why. Since trans people risk violence in gendered spaces, I avoided public restrooms at any cost. While driving, I accidentally hit a parking curb which threw me into a panic attack. One night, I jolted awake after a vividly terrifying nightmare involving sleep paralysis and a man directly behind me, undeterred by my knife.</p>
<p>After enduring something so intimately <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/7-tips-for-dating-a-survivor-sexual-abuse-assault/" target="_blank">traumatic</a>, misunderstood and deeply ingrained within society, nearly everyone seems to blame themselves. As I worked through my post-assault responses and feelings, I began to realize how self-blame can emerge in ways more complex than simply believing it was my fault.</p>
<p>Months later, I read a postcard on PostSecret: “I’m not sure if it was rape.”</p>
<p>“If you’re unsure, it probably was,” I thought. Then I remembered everything.</p>
<p>Until then, I’d clung onto a narrow idea of what defines a rape survivor. I’d believed survivors experience debilitating trauma, explicitly blaming themselves, and suffering from PTSD flashbacks like combat veterans. That wasn’t my experience, so how could I be a survivor?</p>
<h2>Opening Up to Seek Help</h2>
<p>After realizing I’d been raped, I shared my experience in a 12-step meeting. Another member kindly recommended talking to a therapist. My previous therapist had closed her practice, so I made an appointment at the community mental health agency. The new therapist listened empathetically, but I wasn’t sure what to tell him. While I occasionally felt justifiably angry at the man who raped me, my thoughts usually lingered on it without <i>feeling</i> anything.</p>
<p>Later, I realized that I felt a sort of commonality with my assailant. Though not as violently, I’d certainly harmed others with my actions. His was a crime of power but, like my own misdeeds, it was also a crime of opportunity. After this realization, my anger lessened. His actions weren’t remotely acceptable, but indulging my fantasies of revenge only fueled my own misery.</p>
<p>My heart raced with anxiety when my sponsor made the same point. He said, “If you cling onto that resentment, you’re getting raped again.”</p>
<p>That’s a harsh statement which my brain initially took literally, revving into fight or flight mode. But he meant I was only reliving it by holding onto my anger.</p>
<p>That was in 2014. Since then, I’ve utilized what I’ve learned in 12-step meetings to cope with the lingering effects of surviving <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/male-survivors-of-sexual-assault-face-unique-challenges-to-recovery/" target="_blank">sexual assault</a>. Many of these skills are the same ones I’ve learned from therapists: talking or writing about it, meditating, and finding ways to help others. Men aren’t expected to talk about this, but in my experience, many people are willing to listen.</p>
<h2>It’s Not Your Fault</h2>
<p>Recovering from sexual assault is a slow process, but it’s happening. I used to think about it every day, as soon as I woke up. Now, I realize it’s been several days since it’s crossed my mind.</p>
<p>Reflecting back, I realize how my obsessive attempts to prevent another assault were my way of blaming myself. In some ways, it’s easier to blame ourselves because then we could prevent it from happening again. It’s hard to acknowledge the reality that someone else was solely responsible. But it’s also a relief, because I can accept that it wasn’t my fault.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was staying at my parents house for a summer internship before my senior year of college. It was an especially hot summer in LA, and I remember when I woke up that morning I couldn’t tell if what I was experiencing was a fever or if I had just forgotten what a real SoCal summer felt like. I remember sitting down on the toilet, looking between my legs and seeing blood. I remember thinking, “You’ve got to be kidding me.”</p>
<p>After one visit to my family doctor and then another to a specialist, I learned the man I had slept with the night before had left me with not one, but two treasures to remember him by: internal hemorrhoids with abrasions (the blood) and herpes (the fever). When I called to tell him, he didn’t answer. When I went to find him on the gay hook-up app where I had met him, his profile had disappeared. When I Googled his name and the hospital where he purported to work as a physician, I found nothing.</p>
<p>That’s the man who raped me. I don’t remember the name he gave me and I’m almost certain it was a lie, so let’s call him John R. Smith. The “R” stands for rapist.</p>
<p><span id="more-10086"></span></p>
<h2>An Assault on Identity</h2>
<p>Looking back I’m almost thankful for the medical trouble Mr. Smith caused in our encounter. In the immediate aftermath, it allowed to me to focus on my physical health, which was approachable and comforting in its capacity to be “fixed.” What he had done to my psyche, however, felt nebulously painful and, at the time, unfixable. So I avoided it.</p>
<p>Back at school, I was involved in an activist movement at my university to reform administrative responses to sexual violence. After seeing the need for reform first hand while working as HIV test-counselors on our campus, some co-workers and I took on leadership roles in the activist group. We were overly familiar with the issue: survivors of sexual violence were turning to our resource for a sense of security and comfort when the administration failed to adequately support them in the wake of an assault.</p>
<p>All of this is to say: I knew what happened to me wasn’t my fault. I knew the violence I encountered should not and did not tarnish my character. But I still felt those feelings. And I told no one.</p>
<p>As a gay man, I was caught in both the cultural expectations of my gender and my sexuality. What kind of man is raped? If he isn’t able to fend off his attacker, is he a man at all? Shouldn’t he have that John Wayne aversion to feeling that would allow him to disregard the incident entirely? I hated these questions, but I found myself asking them nonetheless. In my social life, I regularly derided “‘toxic masculinity” and considered myself free from its clutches. In the wake of my assault, I found myself feeling as if I had somehow lost the license to call myself a man.</p>
<p>My gayness complicated the issue further. Prior to my assault, I had just begun to feel the agency and self confidence required to comfortably explore my sexual desires and in doing so, enjoy the normalization of casual sex within the gay community. So much of gay male culture is about being “out and proud.”</p>
<p>I was supposed to be the fun and free-living gay guy who not only enjoyed casual sex, but navigated its treacherous, tangled roads with aplomb. What did it say about me that I couldn’t? I didn’t want to believe it happened. And for nearly a year, I told myself it didn’t.</p>
<h2>New Semester, New Love, New Problems</h2>
<p>When I returned to school in the fall, I did everything I could to avoid facing the truth. I kept having casual consensual sex, partially because I enjoyed it and partially because I wanted to prove to myself I still could. I became less involved with activism around sexual violence, using a heavy senior year course load as an excuse. I withdrew from friend groups and communities that demanded too much vulnerability from me.</p>
<p>And then I met a wonderfully tender guy, who became my first serious boyfriend.</p>
<p>As our relationship progressed, my assault and its effects on me became increasingly hard to hide. One night, after we had gotten into bed, my boyfriend rolled over to hold me. This was in no way unusual, but suddenly an insidious thought seeped in: “He’s going to rape you.”</p>
<p>I lied there in silence with my heart racing, convinced a man who never showed me anything but love and respect was about to attack me. After about twenty minutes he asked, “Is everything okay, babe?” I burst into tears. Sobbing, I told him I had been assaulted and it “really wasn’t a big deal.” It had just popped into my head, I said, but everything was fine.</p>
<p>He tried to talk about it with me the next morning. I evaded his questions and words of support.</p>
<p>And then came what I call the “night-jumps.” Almost every night, my boyfriend would wake up at around 2 a.m. to go pee. About three months into our relationship, I started shooting out of bed and shouting “Who are you?” upon his return. I would usually come to full consciousness about halfway through the question. He would apologize for startling me, I would apologize for startling him and we’d go back to bed. At first, we both thought it was sort of funny (I still sort of do), but eventually it became indicative of how deeply Mr. Smith had affected me. And my partner and I agreed I needed to seek professional help.</p>
<h2>Help is Waiting When You’re Ready</h2>
<p>I was blessed to grow up in a home and community in which <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a> wasn’t stigmatized. I already had a therapist who I had found after a bout with depression and social anxiety. We checked in when I felt I needed a “tune-up,” but when I returned for counseling on this particular subject, we hadn’t spoken for nearly a year.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a> and I worked on processing what had happened to me. We worked on developing new tools and strengthening my previously established tools to assist me in confronting and healing from the trauma. She encouraged me to tell my friends, particularly the gay male ones, knowing they were truly supportive and kind. Not only did these men welcome me with open arms, they shared their own experiences. From my work, I knew men who have sex with men regularly experience sexual violence. But until I brought it up, we never really talked about it.</p>
<p>I’m still dealing with my assault. I no longer jump out of bed screaming. I do sometimes have nightmares about it, but it’s rare. I’m always surprised by what will bring it back to the forefront of my mind. Certain sexual positions make me nervous and take me out of the moment. I still don’t like to be touched on the back of my neck. I recently re-watched an episode of a favorite TV show featuring what I once viewed as a harmless, though graphic, joke about sexual violence. I had to turn off the TV.</p>
<h2>A Space to Talk</h2>
<p>If anything this experience forced me to confront underlying issues I already had regarding my own masculinity and sexuality. It forced me to work on issues I’ve had with intimacy for as long as I can remember. I’m not thankful this happened to me, but I’ve grown from it. And furthermore, in working through it, I’ve become a better and more compassionate person. By opening up about my experience, by sharing it with my friends and in turn creating a space for them to share their own, I’ve strengthened my relationships and shifted the culture of support within my community. And that is something I am deeply proud of.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Glitter and jewels coat faces, arms, and cleavage. Outfits are perfectly paired to maximize Instagram appeal and reach. Alcohol and substances fuel the connections of strangers while rotating DJs ensure ample beats.</p>
<p>Despite the lineup of artists, the real show at Coachella Music Festival is the private party scene. I had the opportunity to participate in one such event, the Safe Space Party at Laguna Seca. As a licensed Talkspace sex therapist, I had the privilege of speaking and participating in this event to support the promotion of <a href="https://www.safeapp.me/" target="_blank">a new app, SAFE</a>, designed to support stigma free sharing of STI test results with sexual partners. Other companies and organizations joined the event as sponsors and speakers, including <a href="https://www.instagram.com/amberrose/?hl=en" target="_blank">Amber Rose</a>; Julia Cheek, founder of <a href="https://www.everlywell.com/" target="_blank">EverlyWell</a>, the <a href="https://www.lovecrave.com/" target="_blank">Crave vibrator</a> team; and Vera Papisova from <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/" target="_blank">Teen Vogue</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-9713"></span></p>
<h2>Creating a Safe Space at Coachella</h2>
<p>The great folks at SAFE set up at the event that they called the “Safe Space,” a private tent that encouraged festival-goers to relax, get shade, drinks, and participate in self-care rituals. In this space they held a variety of presentations, including an amazing conversation with Amber Rose about her history and activism efforts, as well as her new slut box product and Lelo sex toys. Amber Rose is an important voice in the sexual health conversation, outspoken about her pride and joy in living her best life as a self proclaimed slut, feminist, mom, and star.</p>
<p>The party outside pulsed with energy and excitement, while despite the stellar line up and best efforts by the planning team, attendance of the panel was unfortunately low. When given the option, drugs, alcohol, and new experiences seemed to trump slowing down to have conversations about safety and well-being.</p>
<p>The contrast was startling, but perhaps not surprising: While not true for every individual, we have created a cultural framework where talking about sex is stigmatized, embarrassing, and shameful. Even more startling was the contrast between the secure environment provided at the Safe Space Party and the <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/sexual-harassment-was-rampant-at-coachella-2018" target="_blank">rampant sexual harassment women experienced elsewhere at Coachella</a>.</p>
<h2>Topics of the Sexual Health Panel</h2>
<p>After her interview, Julia Cheek, Vera Papisova, and I had a panel presentation about sexual health and the related current challenges. I had the opportunity to discuss Talkspace, and the amazing work we’re doing to make therapy accessible to all. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/psychology-stigmatized-female-orgasm-got-back/" target="_blank">Sexual health topics are hard to talk about in general</a>, but particularly face-to-face.</p>
<p>Talkspace provides a platform to receive regular support from trained and licensed therapists, a team of people who — with with ongoing education and training from myself and others — continue to increase their knowledge of sexual health, anatomy, and arousal, as well as the various iterations of sexual practices and identities. These therapists share their knowledge with clients who come to them with a wide range of challenges.</p>
<p>Ms. Papisova guided a profound conversation about the importance of fighting the stigma of sexual health, learning to integrate safety, pleasure and consent conversations into sexual interactions, and shifting our assumptions about bodies, genitals, and what sex looks like. I demonstrated the use of a safe sex kit and discussed the importance of educating yourselves, and finding a therapist who is knowledgeable and accepting of various types of sexual identities, genders, and expression. EverlyWell provided on site STI testing and continues to do meaningful work by making testing available by mail.</p>
<h2>Difficult Conversations Around Sexual Health</h2>
<p>When it comes to sexual health conversations, we are fighting an uphill battle. Some of the most difficult, but most important, conversations for individuals to have — not only with casual sex partners but also long term partners — include:</p>
<ul>
<li>STI testing status and results</li>
<li>Recent partners’ testing status and results</li>
<li>Typical use of barriers (condoms/ dental dams/ etc)</li>
<li>Wants, needs and arousal patterns</li>
<li>Boundaries related to specific sex acts and kinds of touch.</li>
</ul>
<p>These conversations require a level of vulnerability. To feel comfortable fighting <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/women-share-slut-shaming-stories-admit/" target="_blank">the stigma and shame associated with having the sex partners and kinds of sex you’d like to have</a>, you need mental fortitude to navigate possible reactions (such as criticism or rejection).</p>
<p>One attendee I spoke to said he was afraid to offend people by asking about their testing status. The belief that gaining information about potential risks to your health and well-being would be offensive perpetuates avoidance and exponential risk exposure, mental health challenges, and harm in intimate relationships.</p>
<p>Disclosure and self knowledge is empowering, and helps you and your partners mitigate risk. The fear of a positive test or a negative reaction perpetuates avoidance of testing and communication therein. If you’re someone who has had a positive test in the past, depression, anxiety, and trauma-related symptoms can arise. This can impact sexual pleasure and connection in general. In particular, if an STI was transmitted during a sexual assault, the negative impact on psychological well-being and the difficulty engaging in pleasurable sex in the future can be exponential.</p>
<h2>Resources for Sexual Health</h2>
<p>I admit this topic is hard to sell, especially when there are distractions like glitter, music, and sexy people. But there are so many resources out there now to make taking control of your sexual and mental health possible, and accessible.</p>
<p>A few strategies that I recommend to clients include: <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/04/coping-with-sexual-assault-or-picking-up-the-pieces/" target="_blank">getting mental health support for any history of sexual assault</a> or positive STI tests, avoiding fluid exchange when you’re engaging with new partners in party spaces, having conversations before you’re in a sexual situation, and seeking community for support.</p>
<p>Non-fluid exchanging activities to try at parties include dancing, cuddling, sharing fantasies or ideas verbally, mutual masturbation or hand stimulation (as long as there are no cuts on your hands, if there are gloves are useful to have on hand). If you can plan ahead, talking through testing and desired barriers (condoms, dental dams etc) in advance can give you a lot of vital information about your partner’s ability to have the conversation, show concern for your safety and well-being, and respect boundaries you may set.</p>
<p>These strategies serve as preventative tools against sexual assault, while helping you find partners who are more psychologically and ethically compatible.</p>
<h2>Looking Forward to Future Education</h2>
<p>Long term, I am excited about the ways in which Talkspace and I will continue to provide supportive care and healing to individuals struggling with trauma, sexual assault, and the stigma of STI testing. To the Instagram influencers and others who have a captive audience, we can each do our part to change the language we use around testing, consent, boundaries, and slowing down to have the important conversations. It’s sexy to talk about it, and even sexier to show respect and care for a partner.</p>
<p>I wish you many opportunities to seek the pleasure, connection, and adventure you desire without shame or fear. Your health and safety, both physically and psychologically, is important.</p>

<p>If you’re not already masturbating regularly, you might want to add it into your routine (Ugh! What a horrible chore!) Aside from making you feel great, masturbation is great tool for de-stressing. Not convinced yet? Here are some ways masturbation helps you calm down.</p>
<p><span id="more-9578"></span></p>
<h2>Feel-good hormones are released</h2>
<p>Masturbation causes <a href="http://www.besthealthmag.ca/best-you/girlfriends-guide/6-healthy-reasons-to-masturbate/" target="_blank">dopamine</a>, a chemical associated with pleasure, to be released into your body. Simply put, dopamine makes you feel good and puts you in a better mood. On top of that, the hormone oxytocin, which is released during <a href="https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/2015/05/05/masturbation-as-medicine" target="_blank">orgasm, lowers cortisol levels</a>. Cortisol is a main stress hormone, and is usually present in high levels in stressed out people. Touching yourself and climaxing can boost these chemicals and, in result, help you feel more at peace.</p>
<h2>You can learn to love yourself</h2>
<p>Your <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/why-an-how-to-raise-your-self-esteem-for-stress-relief-3144820" target="_blank">self-esteem and body image are linked to your overall well-being</a> including your stress levels. Having poor self-esteem may make it harder for you to deal with everyday stressors. Not to mention, being self-deprecating takes a lot of energy. Being kind to yourself can take some stress off your plate. One way to practice self love is, well, making love to yourself! Get to know your body and appreciate how it works. Regular <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sex-and-relationships/masturbation" target="_blank">masturbation can help improve your body image</a> and self-esteem. Yep, that simple!</p>
<h2>You’ll sleep better</h2>
<p>I’ll never forget one of my previous roommates who said lovingly of her Hitachi magic wand, “That thing has put me to sleep many a night!” We all know <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/sleep-deprivation-hurts-mental-health/" target="_blank">sleep deprivation is no good for stress</a>, so before you turn to sleeping pills, why not turn to masturbation — with or without the help of a magic wand? An orgasm can act like a sedative to help you wind down after a long, stressful day and tire you out for bed, because <a href="https://www.rodalewellness.com/health/how-the-big-o-impacts-your-sleep" target="_blank">climaxing releases hormones like prolactin and oxytocin</a>, which get you nice and sleepy. Bonus: getting a good night’s sleep <a href="https://sleep.org/articles/does-sex-affect-sleep/" target="_blank">boosts your libido</a>. Win, win.</p>
<h2>Relieve physical pain, reduce stress</h2>
<p>Physical pain can really be a nuisance and add onto your stress levels. Masturbation resulting in orgasm can release chemicals called endorphins, which have pain killing properties. They <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=55001" target="_blank">interact with the opiate receptors in your brain</a> to alter your perception of pain. These are the same chemicals that are released after a long exercise session or… eating some dark chocolate. Get your mind off your pain by indulging in a solo sex session and you might find yourself free of pain, and in a zen state of mind.</p>
<h2>No risks, no worries. Reap the benefits of sex without the risks.</h2>
<p>For many people, sex can be more anxiety inducing than it is pleasurable. Sexual intercourse and oral sex come along with a slew of risks like unwanted pregnancy or STDs. You can avoid these dangers all together by having sex with yourself. Masturbation comes with a whopping <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sex-and-relationships/masturbation" target="_blank">0% chance of contracting STDs or getting pregnant</a>! Those who find themselves unable to relax during sex with a partner, because of the possible risks, can let themselves go solo. The safest sex you can have is solo sex!</p>
<p>Go on and flick your bean, spank your monkey, whatever you want to call it! I promise it won’t make you lose your vision (or experience any other bizarre side effect), and you might just <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/5-therapist-approved-ways-de-stress-day/" target="_blank">find yourself feeling a lot less stressed out</a>. Masturbation may be just what the doctor ordered.</p>

Well, that comment may be offensive and unnecessary, but it isn&#8217;t completely wrong.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever heard someone say, “Wow, that person’s miserable! They need to get laid!”?</p>
<p>Well, that comment may be offensive and unnecessary, but it isn&#8217;t completely <em>wrong</em>. Sex may not be a cure-all (though I wish it were) — but it can have a measurably positive impact on your mood, as well as your physical health!</p>
<p><span id="more-9021"></span></p>
<p>In fact, sex actually has multiple positive effects on overall health, with studies to prove it!</p>
<h2>1. Sex reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression.</h2>
<p>Jackpot! <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/mental-health-in-bed-sex-and-depression/" target="_blank">Sex isn’t a &#8220;cure&#8221; for anxiety or depression</a>, but the feel-good hormones and chemicals that are released during sex can temporarily reduce symptoms of both mental health challenges. These include <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-03/regular-sex-benefits-your-mental-health-too-the-conversation/8322520" target="_blank">dopamine, endorphins, and oxytocin</a> which can boost mood, increase compassion, and help you bond with your partner.</p>
<p>While the levels of those chemicals increase with sex, the level of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2703719/" target="_blank">cortisol</a>, the primary stress hormone, also lowers with sex. More sex, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/04/how-stress-affects-our-bodies/" target="_blank">less stress</a>.</p>
<h2>2. It can take your mind off of other things.</h2>
<p>Sex is a kind of temporary escape from the stresses of everyday life. Sure, there&#8217;s a lot to focus on when doing the deed, like how to please your partner, what turns you on, and the pleasure itself. If you find your mind wander to your daily anxieties, try to concentrate on every little physical sensation you’re experiencing. What better way to practice mindfulness than sex?!</p>
<h2>3. Getting busy (sort of) counts as exercise.</h2>
<p>Alright, it&#8217;s not a full workout but sex <i>can</i> be considered light exercise, and it’s way less boring than speed walking on the treadmill. <a href="http://www.thisisinsider.com/how-many-calories-you-burn-from-sex-2017-10" target="_blank">One study concluded</a> that during a 25 minute romp, men burn approximately 100 calories, while women burn about 69 (yes, 69). Even though you’re only burning a small number of calories, you are engaging in physical activity, which is good for your mental health! Exercise can <a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/healthy-living/the-mental-health-benefits-of-exercise.htm" target="_blank">reduce depression and anxiety</a>, so keep up with a good fitness regime overall&#8230;and throw in as many reps of sex as you’d like.</p>
<h2>4. Sex(ercise) helps you sleep.</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/the-surprising-new-connection-between-sleep-and-mental-health/" target="_blank">Getting enough sleep</a> is crucial to both mental health and physical health. Just think about how grouchy you feel when you’re short on sleep, and how much better you feel when you’re well rested! So if you usually have trouble sleeping, trying having xx before bedtime. The hormones released help you feel more relaxed and ready for bed. If you have an orgasm, then the hormone <a href="https://sleep.org/articles/does-sex-affect-sleep/" target="_blank">prolactin is released,</a> which will make you even sleepier.</p>
<h2>5. Kinky sex is clinically linked to well-being (yes, really).</h2>
<p>While non-vanilla sex definitely has a stigma attached to it, kinky sex comes along with some benefits of its own. For example, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12192/epdf?referrer_access_token=x6QEfF9SRO8oxhHZCVmlC4ta6bR2k8jH0KrdpFOxC646Zja-gBeh35xk0eufYeCqijQVUJ2nMQdKH7RMYMYx-OuTVQACiiWwt5V6xnimmU3AYMhWIHbJ1M9tkWuZn6B79k3SmGZLyjTKjMzf4QEGvZm6q7zRQovFJRPjIKzXLt6zEFTDAuMneE13Fen3fvno6EXXjwuDynBaV0uMd44-4T64-d9a0Csdvl5VV8AdR7Kku6sud0hSaqpp8Tl0yyPG" target="_blank">studies have shown</a> that couples that engage in BDSM are better communicators than couples who don’t. Those who practice BDSM also report a comparatively higher sense of well-being. Unsurprisingly, they’re also more willing to try new things. So go ahead and get your Christian Grey on!</p>
<h2>6. Masturbation is just as beneficial.</h2>
<p>Partnerless or saving yourself for marriage? No problem. Masturbating comes along with its own set of benefits. Plus, since you&#8217;re getting it on solo, you won&#8217;t risk unplanned pregnancies or contracting STDs.</p>
<p>On top of releasing those feel-good hormones, masturbation can also help you learn about your own body to figure out what you do and don&#8217;t like so that you can better communicate those things to your current or future partners, making for better sex overall. Masturbation is even linked to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/stress-and-sex/201401/touchy-subject-the-health-benefits-masturbation" target="_blank">better body image</a>.</p>
<p>If all of this doesn’t make you want to go have sex, then I don’t know what will! Just remember to <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/stds-hiv-safer-sex/safer-sex" target="_blank">practice safe sex</a>, avoid <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/when-is-sex-bad-for-your-mental-health-what-to-do-about-it/" target="_blank">unhealthy sex decisions</a>, and, of course, have fun and revel in pleasure. Now, go out and get some! Oh, and don’t forget condoms.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We know that women face a number of challenges to achieving equality. In the boardroom, we face the wage gap. And in the bedroom: The orgasm gap.</p>
<p>Researchers (and everyday people!) have found that a gap exists between the frequency with which men and women experience orgasm, especially during heterosexual sex. Specifically, women <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/stress-and-sex/201510/the-orgasm-gap-simple-truth-sexual-solutions" target="_blank">consistently have fewer orgasms</a> than their male partners.</p>
<p><span id="more-8985"></span></p>
<p>While the orgasm gap may appear to be a product of biology, researchers are increasingly suggesting that the orgasm gap is actually caused by <a href="http://feministing.com/2016/01/19/what-i-would-have-said-to-you-last-night-had-you-not-cum-and-then-fallen-asleep/" target="_blank">what’s in our heads</a>, not what’s between our legs.</p>
<p>Cultural attitudes which discourage female sexual pleasure, as well as a lack of comprehensive sexual education, affect many of our relationships on the most intimate of levels. The result? Less communication and less pleasure — especially for women.</p>
<p>But never fear. By getting to the root of the orgasm gap, we are not only making sure women experience more orgasms (always a worthy goal!) — but we are also building healthier relationships with our partners and ourselves.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin&#8230;</p>
<h2>What is the orgasm gap?</h2>
<p>The orgasm gap is the difference between the frequency with which men and women experience orgasm, especially during heterosexual sex.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have reported a persistent gap, which is largest between heterosexual men and women. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/stress-and-sex/201510/the-orgasm-gap-simple-truth-sexual-solutions" target="_blank">In one study</a>, only 39% of female college students compared to 91% of male students reported that they always experienced an orgasm from partnered sex. <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122412445802" target="_blank">Another study</a> found that the gap is larger in hookup sex, but persists in committed relationships, with men experiencing orgasms 17% more than their female partners. Finally, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25131299" target="_blank">in a survey</a> of 3,000 adult American men and women, women said they orgasm 63% of the time and men said they orgasm 85% of the time.</p>
<h2>What causes the orgasm gap?</h2>
<p>Seeing these statistics, it may be tempting to assume that women just naturally orgasm at a lesser rate than men. But this isn’t necessarily so.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://books.google.co.in/books/about/The_Social_Organization_of_Sexuality.html?id=72AHO0rE2HoC&amp;redir_esc=y" target="_blank">research indicates</a> that women experience orgasm much more frequently <a href="https://books.google.co.in/books?id=9GpBB61LV14C&amp;pg=PA626&amp;lpg=PA626&amp;dq=women+orgasm+masturbation+four+minutes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yCvJna4sHG&amp;sig=pSYztFg517thlA-WOeaMxkE35mg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zh9SUcG4KsSBiwL44YGYBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=women%20orgasm%20masturbation%20four%20minutes&amp;f=false" target="_blank">and quickly</a> while masturbating than with a male partner. Furthermore, women who have sex with women report having orgasms more frequently than women who have sex with men.</p>
<p>While in one study, heterosexual women reported orgasming in 61.6% of sexual encounters, lesbian women <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25131299" target="_blank">reported orgasming</a> in 74.7% of encounters, nearly the same frequency as bisexual men.</p>
<p>So why would lesbians experience orgasm more frequently than heterosexual women? The answer lies in culture, not nature — and specifically, in how we approach sex.</p>
<p>Historically, our culture <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/psychology-stigmatized-female-orgasm-got-back/" target="_blank">stigmatizes female pleasure</a>, discouraging women from exploring our sexualities or <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/insight-therapy/201009/the-masturbation-gap" target="_blank">masturbating</a>. This leads to internalized shame, making it difficult for many women to speak up about what we’re feeling in bed and ask for what we want and need. Many of us might even be at a loss for what we want and need in the first place.</p>
<p>But the problem isn’t with individual women: It goes as deep as our notion of sex itself. As a culture, we tend to <a href="https://www.alternet.org/sex-amp-relationships/orgasm-gap-real-reason-women-get-less-often-men-and-how-fix-it" target="_blank">prioritize sexual activities</a> that lead to male orgasm more than female orgasm, with penile-vaginal intercourse equated with “sex” itself.</p>
<p>This is bad news for female orgasm. In fact, <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0092623X.2017.1346530" target="_blank">most women</a> require or prefer some kind of clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm — and research increasingly suggests that even so-called vaginal orgasms arise from stimulation of one underlying structure, the <a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/women-experience-2-types-orgasms-now-sonographs-reveal-how-clitoral-and-vaginal-climaxes-cause" target="_blank">clitorourethralvaginal complex</a>.</p>
<p>Plus, the longstanding stigma against clitoral pleasure means men may not prioritize clitoral stimulation for their partners and women may not feel able to ask for it.</p>
<h2>How can I close the gap?</h2>
<p>Great orgasms are a product of great relationships. And not just great relationships with your partners: Closing the orgasm gap also requires building a great relationship with your sexuality and yourself.</p>
<p>Your sexual relationship doesn&#8217;t have to fit a certain mold to be healthy — your partner could be for one night or for life, monogamous or polyamorous, and everything in between. But positive, consensual, and respectful sexual encounters in which both parties experience pleasure (and orgasm!) come from a foundation of communication and consideration.</p>
<p>And remember, while orgasms are awesome, sex is about pleasure beyond orgasm. The below skills can help make your relationships and sex more pleasurable overall, regardless of orgasm.</p>
<h2>Explore.</h2>
<p>Sexual pleasure is highly personal and individual, and what works for you might not work for the next woman. So don’t be afraid to explore. Find pornography or erotica that you enjoy. Focus on fantasies that turn you on. Masturbate. Experiment with sex toys. All of these things will help you know what works for your body, give you pleasure, and if you so choose, help you experience more pleasure with partners.</p>
<h2>Communicate.</h2>
<p>You’re probably familiar with the idea that because women are discouraged from advocating for ourselves, we lose out at the workplace bargaining table. The same is true in the bedroom.</p>
<p>Practicing healthy communication doesn’t just help us experience more sexual pleasure — it’s also <em>fundamental</em> to consent. In a healthy sexual relationship, we should feel comfortable saying &#8220;no&#8221; to what we don’t want, and asking for what we <em>do</em> want. And our partners have an obligation to listen, respect our boundaries, and treat us with the consideration we deserve.</p>
<h2>Cultivate healthy relationships.</h2>
<p>While women can learn ways to explore and advocate for our own sexual pleasure, it shouldn’t just be women’s responsibility to close the orgasm gap. It’s everyone’s job to build truly healthy relationships, and it’s especially incumbent on men to be self-critical of whether they are prioritizing their partners’ pleasure as much as their own. As the cultural conversation about gender, sex, consent and pleasure continues, we all have an opportunity to reflect, grow — and orgasm.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sex is wonderful under the right circumstances, but it can turn into something not-so-great and unhealthy when it becomes a way of acting out, or a coping mechanism for other, deeper issues.</p>
<p>Especially when your mental health isn’t on it’s A-game, your sex life can get out of whack.</p>
<p>Here are some less than ideal decisions around sex one can make &#8230; and how to avoid them.</p>
<p><span id="more-8962"></span></p>
<h2>Unhealthy Decision #1: Sex for Self-Esteem</h2>
<p>The amount of sex you have should not determine <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/sexual-self-worth-more-than-just-sex/" target="_blank">your self-worth</a>! Self-esteem should come from within, not from getting laid! Some people use sex as validation for multiple things. For example, you may turn to intimacy to prove to yourself that you’re sexy, or maybe to prove something even deeper, like being worthy of love. Maybe you don’t even want to have sex at all — you just want to know that people want to be intimate with you because you’re seeking approval.</p>
<h2>How to Avoid It: Cultivate Your Self-Worth</h2>
<p>Easier said than done, I know! But there are plenty of ways to boost confidence and body image that don’t involve sex, such as practicing great self-care and avoiding <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/07/does-social-media-have-you-in-a-cage/" target="_blank">preoccupation with social media</a>. When you want to have sex with a new partner, take a step back and ask yourself why you want to get intimate with them. Is it because you’re super attracted to them, or is it because you need an ego boost? In the grand scheme of things, you’re going to need a lot more than sex to feel good about yourself.</p>
<h2>Unhealthy Decision #2: Sex to Fill a Void</h2>
<p>Everyone goes through rough patches in life which can result in feelings of emptiness. We all have different ways of coping, and unfortunately, many times these involve rather unhealthy behaviors like doing drugs, excessively drinking alcohol, gambling, or — you guessed it — loads of casual sex! While sex might temporarily fill a void and make you feel some happiness, it may leave you <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/05/how-much-do-you-really-know-about-loneliness/" target="_blank">feeling even more lonely and empty</a> than you were before.</p>
<h2>How to Avoid It: Find a Healthier Way to Cope</h2>
<p>Self-care, self-care, self-care! It may take some experimentation to figure out what&#8217;s most beneficial for you, but once you find the magic fix, stick with it. You may find solace in taking extra initiative to spend more time with friends or family. You may also turn to doing good deeds, like volunteering at an animal shelter. These are things that can bring you joy and make you feel more full. You might also find a new hobby to indulge in that you can pour a lot of energy into. Try something active like kickboxing or creative like painting!</p>
<h2>Unhealthy Decision #3: Sex to Manipulate People</h2>
<p>Regardless of gender, people may try to have sex with their partner in hopes of getting them to like them more. Maybe sex is used to try to lure or guilt someone into commiting to a relationship. While many healthy relationships do start with a sex-first approach (it’s 2018, people!) the motive of the sex should never be to manipulate someone in any way. The harsh reality is, just because you have sex with somebody, it doesn’t mean they’re going to want a relationship with you. While sex is a big part of relationships, it isn&#8217;t the determining factor of whether or not one will blossom. Although sex is special and intimate, it doesn’t always result in a strong emotional bond.</p>
<h2>How to Avoid it: Pursue Healthy Relationships First</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/6-quick-tips-to-maintain-your-mental-health-while-dating/" target="_blank">Whether you’re meeting a potential mate on a dating app or in person</a>, there are plenty ways to foster a healthy relationship, sex aside. As always, communication is key. If you&#8217;re feeling unstable, let your partner know to help them understand where you&#8217;re coming from. If that scares them away, you know they’re not the right person for you, and it&#8217;s time to move on. Remember healthy relationships are hard work, and you’ll have to put time and effort in to really commit to one.</p>
<h2>Unhealthy Decision #4: Saying &#8220;No&#8221; to Protection</h2>
<p>&#8230;to try to feel closer to someone.</p>
<p>Come on, rookie move! Physically, this is the riskiest decision out of the bunch. Not using protection can result STDs and/or unwanted pregnancy. I get it — the thought of not using a condom when “making love” to someone sounds pretty intimate, right? But, unless you&#8217;ve both talked about it in detail, been recently STD tested, are are 1000% on the same page about it, avoid it! While you might think it’s a great idea, you have no idea what the result might be, and again, this is using sex to manipulate someone.</p>
<h2>How to Avoid It: Get Closer in Other Ways</h2>
<p>There are plenty of other ways to feel closer and build a stronger bond with your partner besides getting it on sans protection. Find a common interest and indulge in it together. Talk about your deepest darkest secrets, fears, and dreams for the future. Have a night alone, just the two of you, no phones allowed! Stick to healthy romance and develop trust (crucial in healhy relationships). Resist temptation to &#8220;go at it raw&#8221; by always keep condoms in your purse, wallet, or bedside table. This way, you’ll be more likely to be responsible. No glove, no love — right?</p>
<h2>Unhealthy Decision #5: Acting Out from Mental Illness</h2>
<p>Some <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/bipolar-disorder-and-relationships/" target="_blank">people who live with Bipolar Disorder</a> experience hypersexuality during their episodes. Manic episodes in general are often characterized by “high” periods with lots of energy and higher activity levels — and this can include their sexual energy. During a manic episode, the person is more likely to have a libido through the roof, as well as be more likely to partake in unsafe sex. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/09/borderline-personality-disorder-impacts-relationships/" target="_blank">Borderline Personality Disorder</a> is another culprit of risky sex. People with BPD are often impulsive with many aspects of their life — sex included. Not to mention, borderline can cause a person to feel extreme attachment to people they care about, and people they have slept with.</p>
<h2>How to Avoid It: Channel Your Energy Elsewhere</h2>
<p>And be proactive about communication.</p>
<p>If you’re in a relationship, have an open discussion with your partner about the changes in your libido during episodes so they know what to expect and be prepared to help and comfort you. Since you have more energy than usual, why not channel it into something more positive and healthy? Get in some cardio exercise. Go for a run or head to a class. If your energy still isn’t calming down, well, some masturbation never hurt anybody! If you’re borderline, it can help to communicate with your partner or partners to help them understand BPD, since it’s often so misunderstood. These characteristics of both bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder are also a great topic to work on with your therapist. If you’re working with a psychiatrist and taking medication, this is definitely something you should speak about with them, as well.</p>
<p>Navigating the world as a sexual being is hard enough. When you throw some unhealthy and risky behaviors in there, your overall wellness is truly put at risk. While it can be hard to think rationally in the heat of the moment, try to think about all the benefits of being responsible, and all of the pitfalls you’re avoiding. Give yourself on the back! It takes practice, but you’ll get there, and you’ll be glad you did. After all, what’s sexier than healthy sex?</p>
