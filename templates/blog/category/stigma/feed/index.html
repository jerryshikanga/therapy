				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1965, TIME magazine published an article titled “<a href="http://time.com/vault/issue/1965-02-12/page/50/" target="_blank">Homosexuals Can Be Cured</a>.” The article focused on the “triumphant” results of group therapy work led by psychiatrist Samuel Hadden, who was also a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School at the time. Hadden had been leading long-term (four to eight year) therapy sessions for men who identified as homosexual in the hopes of “curing” them of their sexual “perversions.”</p>
<p>TIME’s article celebrated Hadden’s ability to help men work through their “symptoms” of “illness”—whether that was wearing inappropriately feminine clothing or being sexually interested in men instead of women. Hadden was only one of many esteemed psychiatrists and psychologists to consider — and treat — homosexuality as a sickness during the 1960s. In fact, homosexuality was not removed from the “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders” [DSM] until 1973.</p>
<p>The pathologizing of homosexuality was not, however, contextually specific to 20th century America. Many of the earliest writings condemning homosexual acts as “unnatural” caught on in 12th century Europe, when religious leaders like Saint Thomas Aquinas denounced homosexuality as a sin in their early writings. Popular disdain against homosexuality, began in the realm of religion, but it quickly moved into the legal arena in centuries to come.<span id="more-5633"></span></p>
<p>For example, in the New Haven colony in 17th century colonial America, homosexuality was not only an illegal crime, but one punishable by death. Into the 19th century, however, “[M]edicine and psychiatry were effectively competing with religion and the law for jurisdiction over sexuality,” as noted in UC Davis’ resources on <a href="http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_mental_health.html" target="_blank">Homosexuality and Mental Health</a>.</p>
<p>Although the cultural shift to regarding homosexuality as an issue of mental health seems anachronistic today, it was, at the time, perceived as progressive. Homosexuality went from being denounced as a sin punishable by death (according to both religious and legal frameworks), to a diagnosis of a mental illness one could not control — but that could be “cured,” as TIME put it in 1965.</p>
<p>Mental illness as an umbrella term was still highly stigmatized at the time — <a href="https://ijmhs.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13033-015-0002-1" target="_blank">and continues to be today, to a lesser extent</a>. It’s only through <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/the-pain-of-anti-lgbtq-bullying-ending-the-silence/" target="_blank">people sharing their stories</a> that there is more visibility— and less stigma —around mental health issues and corresponding treatments. Though in culturally hostile contexts (whether that means 20 years ago or in parts of the world where social stigma related to historically abject identities pervades), sharing is not an option.</p>
<p>But let’s rewind for a second: not all experts in the 1950s and 60s drank the homosexuality-as-illness kool aid. As early as 1905, Sigmund Freud had actually proposed a foundational theory about human sexuality that is now referred to as “inherent bisexuality.” Despite what his predecessors said and did to those they perceived as “sick” with homosexuality, Freud believed all humans were born bisexual, and that their later preferences were simply results of life experiences and conditioning from parents and other loved ones.</p>
<p>In a 1935 letter he wrote to a distraught mother, Freud explicitly discouraged psychiatrists from diagnosing homosexuality as an illness worthy of treatment: &#8220;Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it cannot be classified as an illness.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, when Zoology-trained Alfred Kinsey entered the conversation in 1948, he destabilized the status quo from the vantage point of another discipline, gathering empirical findings about human sexuality. Homosexuality is, if not common in animals, at least present. By developing a groundbreaking study of sexual behavior among American adults (men and women), Kinsey was ultimately able to prove that homosexual behavior was far more common and complex than was previously assumed.</p>
<p>By the 1950s, Freud and Kinsey’s perspectives on homosexuality had been either ignored or disputed by conservative psychiatrists who sought to uphold the predominance of heteronormativity. For many, after the upheavals of the Second World War, the conservative social ideals of the 1950s provided a welcome respite. As behavioral therapy popularized in the subsequent two decades, so too did forms of “conversion therapy” (such as Hadden’s) that sought to “reverse” the effects of homosexuality , including <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jamie-scot/shock-the-gay-away-secrets-of-early-gay-aversion-therapy-revealed_b_3497435.html" target="_blank">more aggressive treatments</a> like electroshock therapy and ice-pick lobotomies.</p>
<p>Change was still happening, though. Kinsey’s empirical studies had prompted other social scientists to research homosexuality in a variety of ways: reviewing published studies and archival data, examining patterns of sexual behavior among non-human species, and comparatively analyzing the social mores around homosexuality across different cultures and societies.</p>
<p>It was in 1957 that psychologist Evelyn Hooker published one of the first and most famous studies that refuted the notion that homosexuality was a psychopathology. It was in the aftermath of Hooker’s findings — and the efficient and powerful political organizing of the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/lgbt/" target="_blank">gay community</a>— that the American Psychiatric Association voted to remove homosexuality from the DSM in 1973. It’s been 44 years since that decision, and certainly, progress has been made to destigmatize homosexuality, and of other mental health diagnoses, too, for that matter. (For clarity, we don’t mean to imply that homosexuality is a mental health diagnosis.)</p>
<p>Nonetheless, let us take note of the fact that there is extreme variation in the acceptance of gay rights across America. Conversion therapy is still happening, though it has been recently banned for minors in California, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington D.C. Critics of conversion therapy highlight that it often relies on abusive practices, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/26/nyregion/new-jersey-jury-says-group-selling-gay-cure-committed-fraud.html?_r=0" target="_blank">both physical and psychological</a>.</p>
<p>In his 2000 congressional campaign, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/30/us/politics/mike-pence-and-conversion-therapy-a-history.html" target="_blank">Vice President Mike Pence famously voiced his desire for the government to defund organizations that “celebrate and encourage” activities that spread HIV</a>. Many gay and transgender folks interpreted this as an affront to their communities. And during President Trump’s campaign, the Republican Party expressed their commitment to the “right of parents to determine the proper medical treatment and therapy for their minor children,” which many believed to be an indirect endorsement of conversion therapy.</p>
<p>Regardless of what government spokespeople say, it is clear that our country’s leadership is seeking to reformulate its social values publicly, through gestures such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/us/politics/devos-sessions-transgender-students-rights.html" target="_blank">rescinding rules on bathrooms for transgender students</a>. As citizens, it’s up to us to continue normalizing all forms of self-expression and markers of identity. As Audre Lorde said, “Your silence will not protect you,” and so it is up to each and every one of us to speak.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an ideal world, taking a mental health day would be simple. Imagine this: You could have 10 per year and use them at your discretion. Or maybe you work at a small company that doesn’t have a formal system for taking time off. In that case it should be as straightforward as talking to your supervisor about why you need one.</p>
<p>You tell your supervisor your depression is acting up. Perhaps your anxiety disorder has been eating you alive lately. Your strained mental health is affecting your productivity, so you need a day off to tend to it, to heal and return with renewed vigor.</p>
<p>She says, “Sure.” There are no questions or judgments, and she is comfortable with you being open about your mental health. She understands the importance of caring for your mental wellness and trusts you are not taking advantage of the policy.<span id="more-5557"></span></p>
<p>In reality, talking about mental illness or asking for a mental health day at many offices is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joseph-rauch/what-happens-when-people-reveal-their-mental-illness-to-their-boss_b_9961536.html" target="_blank">risky</a>. Only the most progressive companies provide mental health days or create an environment where it is safe to ask for one.</p>
<p>It’s a shame because fostering good employee mental health allows companies to mitigate the lost productivity untreated mental illnesses cause. Each year people with depression miss an average 19 work days and suffer 46 days of reduced productivity, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/basics/mental-illness/depression.htm" target="_blank">according to</a> the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. By granting mental health days, employers might be able to improve employee mental health and increase overall productivity.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are many employers who only see requests for mental health days as warning signs of a problem employee. One of our clients at Talkspace opened up about this. When <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/09/ricardo-used-talkspace-overcome-depression-anxiety-abuse/" target="_blank">Ricardo</a> disclosed his mental illness and asked for a mental health day at his old job, he quickly regretted it.</p>
<p>“They use it as a weapon against you,” he said. “They tried to frame me as someone who would snap and was dangerous.”</p>
<p>Ricardo’s company also accused him of abusing drugs, despite not having any evidence. The experience made him hesitant to open up about his mental health issues in the workplace.</p>
<p>Other times companies see mental health days as an excuse to slack off, according to Talkspace therapist Lisa Smith, who also worked in corporate HR for many years. Supervisors are likely to use the disclosure of mental illness against employees, Smith said, unless they work for a very forward-thinking company.</p>
<h2>What to Do Until We Live in That Ideal World</h2>
<p>Because the mind and body are deeply connected, mental illness is also a physical illness, according to Talkspace therapist Nicole Amesbury, who cited the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/basics/mental-illness.htm" target="_blank">American Psychiatric Association’s definition of mental illness</a>. Being sick can mean being depressed or having the flu. A sick day can include mental illness.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it seems most employers do not share this attitude. They aren’t thinking about mental health and illness with the more tolerant mindset of mental health organizations and professionals.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there is hope for all employees who want to take mental health days. If taking a mental health day is the same as taking a sick day, all you need to do is take a few more sick days.</p>
<p>“I believe in calling the office early in the morning and telling the appropriate person you&#8217;re taking a sick day, because you don&#8217;t feel well,” said Talkspace therapist Samantha White. “It&#8217;s not a lie.”</p>
<p>Stress and mental health issues can make us feel sick, White said, similar to a cold or sore throat. Sometimes we need a day off to recuperate.</p>
<p>“We feel unwell and need the day off,” White said. “That&#8217;s the bottom line and is all they need to know.”</p>
<p>Until the average employer becomes more understanding and accepting of mental illness, we need to be tactful and cautious about asking for mental health days or disclosing mental illness. There are <a href="http://www.nami.org/Find-Support/Living-with-a-Mental-Health-Condition/Succeeding-at-Work" target="_blank">laws</a> that make it illegal to discriminate against an employee based on a mental health condition. In practice, however, these laws do not necessarily prevent an employer from unfairly firing or forcing an employee out of the company because of their challenges.</p>
<p>For now let’s try to emphasize the value of mental health days and fight the stigma of mental illness. Once more employers realize they are hurting themselves — not only their employees — by stigmatizing mental health days, we might see a shift in attitude.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>It is revolutionary for any trans (transgender) person to choose to be seen and visible in a world that tells us we should not exist. ~ Laverne Cox</h2>
<p>Over the past couple of years the transgender community has gained a higher level of mainstream exposure. This is in part thanks to the transgender men and women who helped fight for equality at New York City’s <a title="Closing time for this legendary gay bar? Don't bet on it. It just received historical protection." href="http://www.upworthy.com/closing-time-for-this-legendary-gay-bar-dont-bet-on-it-it-just-received-historical-protection?c=ufb1" target="_blank">Stonewall Inn</a> riots back in the1960s. They, among many other social influencers, paved the way into popular culture for transgender individuals like Cher’s son Chaz Bono, Laverne Cox on the hit Netflix show <em>Orange is the New Black</em>, as well as activists and authors like Janet Mock, who released last year’s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Redefining-Realness-Path-Womanhood-Identity/dp/1476709130">Redefining Realness: My Path to Womanhood, Identity, Love &amp; So Much More</a></em>.<span id="more-1471"></span></p>
<p>Awareness of transgender issues recently hit stratospheric heights when former Olympian and Decathlon winner Caitlyn Jenner came out as a transwoman in a historic interview with Diane Sawyer. Her story has prompted conversations in households and workplaces that many folks never had before and left the world with a more intimate understanding of what it means to be transgender.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, many families are now finding themselves learning how to best support loved ones that identify as transgender.</p>
<p>I hope this piece will give them, as well as you, some very practical tips on how to do that.</p>
<h4><strong>Create an environment that is supportive of all people (of all genders).</strong></h4>
<p>One of the most important things that you can do to best support someone who is transgender or gender nonconforming is to create a safe space for ALL people. Contrary to some critics, transpeople don’t want “special rights” or unsolicited attention. By far, folks who identify as trans want to be seen for the whole of their being, not just their gender identities.</p>
<p>If you can help create a space and environment in your home or workplace that is safe for a variety of genders, sexualities, races, religions, or levels of ability, you can be sure that you’re creating an environment that is welcome to trans people. You can reflect your acceptance by something as small as a rainbow sticker on your door. Organizations can adjust forms that allow for an open response for gender demographics. A little change goes a long way.</p>
<h4><strong>Do your own research.</strong></h4>
<p>If you would like to further your knowledge about what it means to be trans, there is a lot of information online that you can readily access. Chaz Bono released his documentary <em>Becoming</em> <em>Chaz</em> back in 2011. The film, which is currently available on Netflix, explores Chaz’s transition and his relationship with his superstar mother. You may also want to read Janet Mock’s book mentioned above; you can find it in most bookstores.</p>
<p>Along with a wide selection of blogs and websites, there are also some great YouTube channels that feature trans people such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ63ottEtOBy1Jp92nzPlmg">Jazz Jennings</a>, who is a 14-year-old transgirl who was once featured on ABC News. <em>A Girl Like Me</em> with Chloe M is also a great vlog channel for transwomen and families seeking to learn more. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe5IabAzRyXqLpAib13Q2yw">Aydian Dowling</a>, a transman and fitness model, also has a YouTube channel and he recently discussed his gender identity and transition on the Ellen show.</p>
<h4><strong>Ask questions.</strong></h4>
<p>Although it&#8217;s not your loved one’s responsibility to educate you about all things trans, some people do relish that opportunity. You will get a good sense if they’re open to educating you once you express genuine interest and curiosity in their process. It should be noted that if questions are well intentioned, generally speaking, most people are going to respond favorably.</p>
<h4><strong>Ask for PGPs.</strong></h4>
<p>Preferred gender pronouns or PGPs are ways in which we all identify ourselves, or others in a conversation. For instance, if you were assigned a male sex at birth and identify as a man, you may prefer the terms &#8220;he/him/his&#8221;.  Whereas if you were assigned a male sex at birth but you identify as a woman, you may want to use female pronouns such as &#8220;she/her/hers&#8221;. However, a word of caution &#8211; some trans or gender nonconforming people may prefer gender terms that you may not consider obvious given how you perceive them, which is why it&#8217;s so important to ask someone for their PGPs to avoid misgendering them altogether. Gsafe has a great online resource on gender pronouns that you can find <a href="https://www.gsafewi.org/wp-content/uploads/What-the-heck-is-a-PGP1.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>Learn to apologize.</strong></h4>
<p>Odds are, no matter how well intentioned you are, you will make the mistake of using the wrong PGP or refer to your friend or loved one by an old name.  In a perfect world none of us would ever make those mistakes, but it has been my experience that you will get a pass if you say “I’m sorry”, then correct yourself and move on quickly.</p>
<h4><strong>Stand up and become an ally.</strong></h4>
<p>One of the most powerful ways that you can support trans people is to become an ally for the transgender community. Challenge your other friends and colleagues on their assumptions about gender. Write your local representatives to advocate for fair bathroom access for transpeople in your area.  Participate in local organizations that fight for equal rights.</p>
<h3>The efforts and hard work you’ll be putting in won’t go unnoticed by the transgender, gender nonconforming, and general public!</h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>As temperatures continue to rise, so does the excitement at Talkspace headquarters!</h2>
<p>The second week of June proved to be a really busy one for Talkspace. Not only did we spend two days hanging out at Brooklyn’s Northside Festival, we also managed to make our way to Philly Pride, supporting the LGBTQ community in the city of love!</p>
<p><span id="more-1441"></span></p>
<h4>The Northside Festival</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/11390036_10153896384719908_2570054243473645311_n.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-1467 alignright" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/11390036_10153896384719908_2570054243473645311_n-225x300.jpg" alt="Talkspace Takes Over the Northside Festival and Philly Pride" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/11390036_10153896384719908_2570054243473645311_n-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/11390036_10153896384719908_2570054243473645311_n.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a></p>
<p>Now in its seventh year, the festival once again took over Williamsburg’s McCarren Park from June 8<sup>th</sup> to June 14th. Billed as Brooklyn’s answer to South by Southwest, the festival assembled the most disruptive brands in technology and innovation, as well as over 150 bands from near and far to perform on its famous Northside stage.</p>
<p>Naturally, Talkspace was there. The day started off with a keynote presentation by Talkspace founders, Roni and Oren Frank. The immersed crowd listened to how the disruptive online therapy platform is transforming the face of mental health care, before joining the rest of the attendees for the festivities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/11391762_10206887372964439_2250165205612652101_n.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-1463 alignright" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/11391762_10206887372964439_2250165205612652101_n-300x225.jpg" alt="Talkspace Takes Over the Northside Festival and Philly Pride" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/11391762_10206887372964439_2250165205612652101_n-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/11391762_10206887372964439_2250165205612652101_n.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Coming all the way from the remote island of Manhattan, Talkspace brought along its <a title="http://bedfordandbowery.com/" href="http://bedfordandbowery.com/2015/06/feeling-down-pop-into-this-igloo-for-some-online-therapy/" target="_blank">famed and highly anticipated therapy bubble</a>, complete with air-conditioning and home furniture. Curious attendees made their way towards the inflated structure where they were greeted by our therapist superstars, and were then escorted inside. From there, they were shown how the online therapy platform could be used from the comfort of their own home.</p>
<h4>Philly Pride</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/549326_10207723026097613_5651166551766178893_n.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-1461 alignleft" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/549326_10207723026097613_5651166551766178893_n-300x162.jpg" alt="Talkspace Takes Over the Northside Festival and Philly Pride" width="300" height="162" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/549326_10207723026097613_5651166551766178893_n-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/549326_10207723026097613_5651166551766178893_n.jpg 619w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Solidarity at its best! With the diversity of our in-house team and that of our therapists, Talkspace was absolutely thrilled and deeply honored to sponsor Philly Pride on June 15th. Not only do we support the advancement of LGBTQ-friendly rights and legislature, we are familiar with the personal, social, and mental issues individuals from this diverse community may be facing.</p>
<p>While the purpose of the event is to bring visibility and awareness about LGBTQ issues to the general public, Talkspace was there to support the mission as well as shed a bit of light on the unique emotional and mental needs of the LGBTQ community. Offering help to people from all walks of life, we strive to advocate for equal rights and mental health care for all.</p>

Similarly, a few more of our incredible therapists held down the fort while explaining the Talkspace platform to the surrounding crowd. Taking curious listeners through he registration process and getting them familiar with the service, they answered questions as well as gave out promotional codes to interested parties.</p>
<p>With two successful events behind us, we have already begun working on some new (kind of major) projects that we will unveil over the next few months.</p>
<h3>Stay tuned, the Talkspace team simply can’t wait to let you in on what’s currently in the event pipeline &#8211; we think you’re going to like it.</h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Those of us who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) are often viewed as marginalized because we are not part of the dominant sexual orientation culture, which is heterosexuality.</h2>
<p>Though in recent years, with an ever growing presence of lesbian and gay pop culture celebrities (ex: Ellen DeGeneres), characters on TV (ex: Modern Family), as well as growing public and government support for same sex marriage, it seems the margins are getting smaller&#8211;at least for some. Still, there are challenges certain sub-populations of LGB communities face when it comes to experiencing oppression inside of a marginalized community.<span id="more-1260"></span></p>
<p>I will explore the issues faced by three specific sub-populations within the LGB spectrum: bisexuals, women, and people of color. I will also discuss some of the consequences oppression can have on a person’s emotional wellness. But I will not address gender identity (transgender persons) intentionally, to avoid the trap of lumping sexual orientation and gender identity into the same category, since they are very different things.</p>
<p>Bisexuals often receive a lack of acceptance regarding their sexual orientation from lesbians and gays as well as heterosexuals. Often, these groups don’t see bisexuality as a valid sexual orientation and that the bisexual person needs to “choose a side” in order to be accepted. This creates a level of marginalization for bisexual individuals that can make it difficult to feel validated for who they truly are and how they feel.</p>
<p>This can cause stress, anxiety, depression and low self worth, due to the lack of validation in their day-to-day lives. The individual may feel that he or she does, indeed, need to &#8220;choose a side&#8221; in order to alleviate the tension. In addition, while public discourse has advanced quite a bit regarding gays and lesbians, with TV programs featuring same sex couples and others showing various aspects of the gay and lesbian experience, one is hard pressed to find a similar level of discourse about bisexual persons.</p>
<p>Seeing examples of people like themselves in popular media is what often helps minority groups (of any kind) feel a greater sense of self worth. The dearth of examples further contributes to the marginalization many bisexual persons experience.</p>
<p>At times, women are also marginalized in mainstream gay and lesbian culture. I know this may sound counter-intuitive, as the dominant sub-populations that exist in sexual minority communities are gay men and lesbian women. However, if you look at the social scene in most cities across the United States, you&#8217;ll find that there are very few lesbian bars, clubs, and social spaces in general as compared to those for gay men. Additionally, there are quite a few websites and apps dedicated specifically for gay and bisexual men to meet each other, whereas there are not as many for lesbians.</p>
<p>The lack of social spaces and modes of meeting other women, especially if there are no bars or clubs in a particular locality, can leave many lesbian women feeling isolated, making it difficult to date and find a partner. Furthermore, in some gay male dominated spaces, there is an anti-lesbian sentiment that exists, which leads to further marginalization of lesbians in some communities. All of this can lead to lesbians feeling that there are very few social spaces welcoming of them and dedicated to them for enjoying each other, as well as for finding refuge from oppressive forces many experience in their day-to-day lives.</p>
<p>Of course this marginalization can also lead to feelings of isolation, depression, anxiety and low self worth among other issues that place a burden on their emotional wellness.</p>
<p>The third sub-population among LGB communities that may find themselves oppressed are people of color. Unfortunately racism exists within LGB communities. Sometimes this oppression comes in the form of dress codes in clubs that will not allow someone to enter in hoodies or wearing baseball caps, etc. Sometimes it is the more subtle exclusion of activities that might be of more interest to people of color or explicit inclusionary practices within social groups.</p>
<p>While many cities around the country have Black gay prides, very few have prides for other racial or ethnic groups. Additionally, these celebrations are one-time-a-year events. There are few social spaces for LGB people of color to attend throughout the year that openly affirms who they are. This can lead to the same effects previously discussed for other sub-populations such as low self worth, anxiety, isolation and depression.</p>
<p>What is important here is that as individuals we realize when our spirit may have been diminished or broken as a result of distressing experiences we have throughout our lives. We cannot place a cost on our emotional wellness, yet for many of us, it is not prioritized the same as our physical health. Here, at Talkspace, we are working to remove the stigma related to engaging in therapy, and provide a space for people to access therapy in a professional and supportive environment. What is also amazing here is that the issue of geographical location between you and the therapist is not an issue. As long as you have a device that can connect to the Internet, you can receive therapy.</p>
<p>And, if you feel afraid of seeking therapy in your town because of homophobia or because you don’t want others to know about your sexuality &#8212; Talkspace is ideal service for you. You can access safe, non-heterosexist, and supportive counseling, which can help you deal with your life challenges, whether they are rooted in your sexuality or not. There are few feelings better than living in a space of emotional wellness. So, take the plunge and engage in therapy!</p>
<h3>As an LGB person, if you feel you are living life on the margins&#8211;that you are experiencing oppression that is damaging your spirit, let us help you revitalize yourself.</h3>

<p><em>&#8211; by Liz Campese / Journalist and Talkspace Staff Writer</em></p>
<p>As you&#8217;ve probably already heard, <a title="Introducing Caitlyn Jenner" href="http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/06/caitlyn-jenner-bruce-cover-annie-leibovitz" target="_blank">Caitlyn Jenner unveiled her true self</a> to the world this week. And although it&#8217;s hard to know for sure if societal pressure to adhere to gender expectations was the main reason she kept her identity a secret for as long as she did, I know it doesn&#8217;t have to be this way.<span id="more-961"></span></p>
<p>It seems ridiculously silly to zero in on the gender of a person and dismiss the impact of their individual personality, interests, dreams, and convictions on who they are as a whole. With how much<a title="research on gender identity and expression" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=research+on+gender+identity+and+expression&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholart&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5VluVbCTBMacsAWhkIHQAQ&amp;ved=0CBsQgQMwAA" target="_blank"> research</a> has been conducted on sexuality and gender flexibility over the years, <a title="The right therapy for LGBT youth" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-right-therapy-for-lgbt-youth/2015/05/01/b43965e6-eeb4-11e4-8666-a1d756d0218e_story.html" target="_blank">mental health professionals can now effectively help gender-variant people</a> accept themselves and live their lives as exactly who they are.</p>
<p>Concerns for which gender-variant people may seek counseling range from struggling with self acceptance to dealing with <a title="Responding to transgender victims of sexual assualt" href="http://www.ovc.gov/pubs/forge/sexual_numbers.html" target="_blank">complex social and relational issues</a>. Many of the therapists at Talkspace have extensive experience helping LGBTQ individuals overcome gender-identity and sexual orientation-related problems. Some can even speak from personal experience. Everyone professionally affiliated with Talkspace has a passion for helping all types of people achieve peak mental health and personal happiness.</p>
<p>I, for one, have always had an interest in learning about gender norms, different sexual orientations, the fluidity of gender identity and expression, as well as how society influences our understanding of each. These were some of the questions I wanted to explore when I decided to major in sociology. As sociologists, we are trained to detect patterns that emerge within a culture or in a community, as well as explain why and how they came to be. Throughout college, I supported myself by working in a toy store, which strangely proved to be an incredibly eye-opening experience that taught me a lot about gender expectations and how they influence gender expression in young and adolescent children.</p>
<p>The store was divided into different sections: plush toys, art supplies, educational games, various costumes, so on and so forth. As a budding sociologist, I made an observation pertaining to the specific shopping patterns the parents exhibited when they came in to purchase something for their kids. As there were many recurring customers, the experience of helping them pick out a product became an interesting sociological case study that spanned across 2 years.</p>
<p>I noticed that when shopping for boys, a hefty percentage of parents gravitated toward shiny microscopes; amazingly creative construction sets; books about biology, space and technology; tool kits and medical supplies; cop and fireman gear; and other really cool things that are of interest to all kids, but mostly associated with boys. And it doesn&#8217;t take much mental effort to realize that these toys facilitate interests that can be beneficial in life personally, socially, or professionally.</p>
<p>When shopping for girls, however, parents exhibited a very different pattern. Although there were plenty of young girls that showed enthusiastic interest in telescopes and magnets and remote-controlled gadgets, their parents would normally buy them something else &#8211; something they thought was more appropriate for girls. They were a lot less likely to buy toys like a talking atlas that teaches kids about each country, or an interactive encyclopedia that could be immeasurably educational. They were a lot more likely to purchase a tea set, princess outfits, art supplies or a dollhouse.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I am not implying that letting girls play with dolls or boys play Cowboys and Indians is a bad thing. But I am stating that parents have to be mindful of how their actions and gender expectations can affect the gender identity and gender expression in their children. <a title="Gender and motivation" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022440506000392" target="_blank">Research</a> shows that the environment in which a person is raised plays a huge role in how their sexuality and identity are expressed. Whether or not a child grows up to be a well-adjusted human being is very much influenced by his or her parents.</p>
<h3>On a great day, an open-minded parent would come into the store and buy a tea set as well as a microscope for their child. I hope it&#8217;s because they want their kid to know how to make tea as well as excel in science, regardless of their gender.</h3>
