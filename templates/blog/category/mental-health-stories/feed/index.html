<hr />
<p>Teenage years can be some of the most difficult and stressful times of our lives. With exam deadlines and social pressures, it can leave many of us struggling to focus and see a life outside of the school halls. There are many who are made for education, flying through their school years with ease, but for some of us, our mental health can be compromised.</p>
<p>I found myself often confused and unable to make decisions. I was always worrying about rejection and causing problems. Stress was consuming me. Although I had friends, a boyfriend, and a family, I still could not tell them the truth, or at least not the <i>full</i> truth. Choosing to begin therapy was the first time I had put myself first in a long time. The term “it feels like a weight has been lifted” really resonates with me.</p>
<p><span id="more-9942"></span></p>
<h2>Starting Therapy</h2>
<p>I was 16 years old when I first started <a href="https://talkspace.com/online-therapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a>. I had been struggling with depression and anxiety for a very long time and struggled to let out my emotions in a healthy way. When I fell into substance abuse, my parents worked with my school to find me some help. One day a week, I would get a free “get out of jail free” pass from lessons and would make my way to this almost secret room to meet my therapist.</p>
<p>I remember how nice it felt to find privacy away from the prying ears of those I knew. The ability to be totally honest, and know that what we discussed would not leave these four walls, allowed me to breathe for the first time. Letting out your feelings, all those hidden thoughts and bricks that you have been lugging around for months, or even years, feels better than any other endorphin releasing activity.</p>
<p>It can be awkward to share your feelings with a stranger. There were worries that what I disclosed may come out as rude, nasty or even lead the therapist to report me as a danger to myself. However, the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/">therapist</a> was very good at breaking the ice each session and when I started to talk, I couldn’t stop. It was like a blocked pipe being released and drained — it needs to be looked after to function. I cannot explain how good it felt just to let myself rant and not stop my “verbal diarrhoea” — almost like using the loo after holding in a wee for hours, a release that just leaves you feeling relaxed and detoxed.</p>
<p>As time went on, I found myself more comfortable talking about what was going on in my mind. I learnt that I was not a problem, that my thoughts were valid, and I had every right to feel the way I did. It is so strange to hear these words but when someone reminds you that “it’s ok not to be ok,” it jogs you back into reality, and makes you think differently.</p>
<h2>Why Therapy is Important</h2>
<p>I am now back in therapy after putting it on hold for many years, but I am excited. I’ve only had a few sessions so far, and already I feel so much more refreshed and in control of my own body. It’s easier to fight a battle when you have someone to stand by your side. Talking is the first step and the key to defeating those demons that reside in your mind.</p>
<p>Therapy has not necessarily helped me with one particular issue that I have, it has generally helped me manage and cope with my thoughts and feelings. I feel so much more human, and I am truly grateful that I have access to therapy. I always recommend it to anyone. Sometimes we just need to vent so we can learn more about ourselves.</p>
<p>Therapy has been so important to my recovery. It has given me an outlet for my feelings, and its brief lessons help me unlock parts of myself that I have repressed. It’s exhausting and it’s hard, but I now know myself better than ever. I understand who I am and why my mind does what it does. <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_POST_INLINE&amp;utr_adgroup=therapy-helped-me-learn-to-share-my-feelings?utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/therapy-helped-me-learn-to-share-feelings" target="_blank">Therapy is like a friend you can rely on</a>, at least it has been to me.</p>

Talkspace shares stories of how therapy helps people of all backgrounds work through the daily challenges of modern life.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>The panic attacks escalated during my senior year of college.</p>
<p>Once, I was sitting on the side of the freeway. I abandoned my car a mile back and called 911, convinced I was having a heart attack. Confused, I gave the 911 operator the wrong location of where I was. The longer I waited for help the more I struggled to breathe.</p>
<p><span id="more-9877"></span></p>
<p>Another time, while stopped at a traffic light inside the city streets, I got out of my car and started walking. Vehicles raced past me while others honked their horns and cursed me for obstructing traffic. I left my car in the middle of the busy street and walked home. When I arrived I broke down and cried.</p>
<p>They were difficult to predict, but sometimes I felt a panic attack coming on. At home alone, I was suddenly afraid something horrible was going to happen to me. I had it set in my head that I needed get out of the house or I would die. I took off out the door and wandered the city streets. It was midday in Phoenix, and the 114 degree August heat blistered my bare feet. I had no water, no phone, and no idea where I was going.</p>
<p>I was a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/therapist-helped-become-best-single-mom/" target="_blank">single mother</a> working to support my family while attending school full time. I was in the home stretch. Though my education should have created a sense of hope for the future of myself and my children, the pressures of so many obligations suddenly began to break me. I was panicking.</p>
<h2>Seeking Help for my Panic Attacks</h2>
<p>As the panic attacks began to occur more often, I was forced to acknowledge the unsafe situations I was putting myself in. I also suffer from <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/know-kind-bipolar/" target="_blank">Bipolar Disorder II</a>, which often plays with my mind, even more so because I am high functioning. There’s a place in between the waves of depression and manic crash where I believe I have a firm grasp on the illness, but that grasp often proves an illusion.I knew I needed help, but this would prove challenging with my hectic schedule. The college provided free counseling on campus and I decided to give it a try. I wasn’t sure what to expect.</p>
<p><i>Will the counselor and I develop a treatment plan? Will we have regularly scheduled appointments or is it a one time thing? What are the counselor’s credentials? </i>These were the questions I asked the receptionist when scheduling an appointment.</p>
<p>“He can meet with you right now,” she said and handed me a questionnaire to fill out.</p>
<p>I felt uncomfortable during my first session with Thomas, it was a new experience. I explained the recurring panic attacks, and there was little dialogue between us as he formulated a plan for me. He handed me a sheet of paper, referring to it as a “homework assignment,” and set up an appointment time for the following week.</p>
<p>The worksheet was a diagram. At the top was a box that read: “Panic Attack.” I was to fill in the empty boxes below with the feelings I experience leading up to my panic attacks.</p>
<p>During our next appointment, he guided me through the physiology of fight or flight response and we worked on breathing exercises.</p>
<p>Our next few visits focused on these exercises and coping tools I would use if the panic attacks continued.</p>
<h2>Understanding Panic in the Moment</h2>
<p>I was in the grocery store when I began to feel yet another attack come on. Standing alone in the aisle I stopped in my tracks and did a breathing exercise. It helped. I felt calmer and proceeded to the next aisle. I turned the corner and saw a cluster of people.</p>
<p>My vision tunneled, my heart raced and my fingertips went numb. I freaked out and dropped the basket full of groceries I was carrying. I watched the items hit the floor and explode, causing everyone to look up at me. My pulse pounded in my ears and my hairline dripped with sweat.</p>
<p>I ran from the store.</p>
<p>The next time I saw Thomas I expressed my frustration. We were on our sixth visit, but I was still having panic attacks. We hadn’t even begun to work toward the discovery of <i>why</i> I panic. But I still felt hopeless.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to figure out why you panic,” he said. “You need to learn how to deal with it.”</p>
<p>“I’m not safe when I have a panic attack.”</p>
<p>“You put yourself in unsafe situations trying to stop yourself from panicking. What would happen to you if you just allowed yourself to panic?”</p>
<p>We fell silent while I contemplated his question.</p>
<p>“Nothing would happen. I’d just have a panic attack and then it would be over.”</p>
<h2>What I Learned From My Therapist</h2>
<p>Thomas helped me realize that I was causing myself more panic by not allowing myself to accept what was happening to me in the moment. Panic attacks aren’t necessarily bad or harmful. It’s a physical defense to an emotional reaction.</p>
<p>I still struggle with anxiety as a symptom of depression, but <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_POST_INLINE&amp;utr_adgroup=therapy-helped-me-stop-my-panic-attacks?utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/therapy-helped-me-stop-my-panic-attacks/" target="_blank">thanks to my experience in therapy</a>, I am thankful to say I haven’t experienced another panic attack.</p>

<hr />
<p>In my early twenties, I was lost. I could <i>tell</i> something was wrong with me. My friends were all away attending universities, learning and excited, actively participating in being alive. I was living with my parents, playing hours of World of Warcraft and having panic attacks in my car before attending local community college classes.</p>
<p>I had always been a bit of an odd duck. It took me longer to reach the same milestones as my peers: I learned to drive later, I got my first boyfriend later, I attended college later, and I got my first job later as well. And worse, I was not interested in a whole lot. I did not find my existence to be meaningful or my life to be particularly enjoyable.</p>
<p><span id="more-9838"></span></p>
<p>I felt a <i>lot </i>of shame about this. And the thing about shame is that it eats away at you. It distorts your self view, and everything you were already struggling to accomplish becomes exponentially more difficult. I had this insidious inner voice telling me I was useless, a waste of space, a waste of time, and a waste of resources., it would be better if I were not around because I was actively bringing down everyone around me.</p>
<p>Some part of me understood this negative inner voice wasn’t “normal.” Other people did not seem to wake up hating themselves and hoping for it to end. Beyond this, even though my shame was rooted in what I perceived to be a lack of accomplishment, I could see my self-hatred was pushing me even farther away from being functional, and accomplishing the things my friends were. Without any real hope of change, I decided I wanted to know why I was different. I needed an explanation.</p>
<h2>Looking for an Answer</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kate-allan_comic_143.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-9841" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kate-allan_comic_143-192x300.jpg" alt="Kate Allan Illustrates a Visit to her Therapist" width="300" height="468" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kate-allan_comic_143-192x300.jpg 192w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kate-allan_comic_143-768x1197.jpg 768w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kate-allan_comic_143-657x1024.jpg 657w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kate-allan_comic_143.jpg 1554w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Where does a reclusive nerd look for knowledge? The internet, of course! Even though everyone likes to joke that “nobody lies on the internet,” I actually found quite a bit of helpful information, which began to add context and meaning to my predicament. Through social media, I found a mental health community that taught me important terms like “mental health,” “depression,” “self-care,” and “anxiety.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/when-does-normal-anxiety-become-a-mental-illness/" target="_blank">ANXIETY</a>. Oh my god. There it was: the dark, menacing figure that had been darting <i>just</i> out of frame, like the gruesome antagonist of the horror movie that was my life. Laid bare in the open. It had a name. It had weaknesses.</p>
<p>I found people who had a hard time leaving their houses. I found people who had a hard time making phone calls. I found people who also felt loads of shame about how difficult normal, everyday things were. After years of pain and isolation, I discovered I was far from alone.</p>
<p>So, I then tentatively made an action plan. If this ANXIETY thing was what I was experiencing, I wanted a certified professional to figuratively stamp it on my forehead.</p>
<h2>Finding the Help I Needed</h2>
<p>I went online, found a therapist who accepted my insurance, and made an appointment. The psychologist I found was a woman in her 60s with kind eyes, double-pierced ears, and a warm office with especially comfortable couches. What was most wonderful about her was she <i>believed me</i>. She listened to my story and validated my struggles. There was no skepticism or blame.</p>
<p>She asked what I wanted out of therapy, and I told her I needed a name for what I was experiencing. Pretty much right off the bat; “You show many symptoms of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/different-types-anxiety-disorders-classified/" target="_blank">Generalized Anxiety Disorder</a>.”</p>
<p>Now, the usual person would be like, “Oh shit. I AM ILL, OH SHIT.” But my reaction? Absolute relief. And why? I couldn’t blame myself anymore! I had no concrete reason to be frustrated with myself. All that shame about my difficulties was entirely unwarranted. There was, and is, a <i>legitimate reason</i> why I struggle.</p>
<p>Also, I had a name for the problem. What does a name grant you? Excellent benefits like treatment programs, access to people with similar issues, tried and true coping mechanisms, a way to communicate, and a label for daily struggles. “I am scared to leave my house” was merely a manifestation of an anxiety disorder. Another piece of my monster.</p>
<h2>Therapy Takeaways</h2>
<p>Therapy after the diagnosis was very helpful as well. My therapists have used a combination of approaches to get me functioning again.</p>
<h3>What Has Worked Best for Me</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Mindfulness:</b> Becoming aware of my fear, labeling it as fear, realizing it is separate from me, leaning into the feeling and understanding I can survive through it</li>
<li><b>Cognitive behavioral therapy:</b> Recognizing negative thoughts, mentally catching and correcting assumptions, setting short-term goals and planning how to cope through stressful situations</li>
<li><b>Reframing:</b> Reviewing past trauma and putting it in context, validating past difficulties and hurts and understanding how past occurrences affect current feelings and behavior</li>
</ol>
<p>I am nearly thirty now, a self-proclaimed therapy veteran, and life is so much better. Even though I sometimes have terrible days where it’s difficult to remember why I choose to fight, most days are <i>actually</i> good. I work, I have close relationships, and I create. <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_POST_INLINE&amp;utr_adgroup=therapy-helped-me-identify-my-anxiety?utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/therapy-helped-me-identify-my-anxiety" target="_blank">Through what I have learned in therapy</a>, I have managed to invent my own purpose for being here. I now have a life I actually want to live.</p>

<hr />
<p>When I stop to think about the role of therapy in my life, it is not difficult to realize how essential it was for me to become the person I am today. I met my current therapist five years ago when I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder. I had panic attacks and could barely get out of the house, so my therapy sessions were the only time I socialized with anyone — and it was like that for a few months.</p>
<p><span id="more-9783"></span></p>
<p>At first <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/10/what-i-wish-someone-had-told-me-about-how-therapy-actually-works/" target="_blank">I wasn’t sure how my psychologist could help me</a>, and I didn’t really feel comfortable opening myself to her. Everything I said was calculated, and since I was so insecure and destabilized, I feared that she would judge me if I was completely sincere. Over time, the calm and tranquility that I felt as we dealt with my problems made me increasingly spontaneous and secure in sharing my thoughts. Every time I sat in that green chair, she was there to support me and not to judge — indeed, she helped me get rid of my own stigma around my mental illness.</p>
<p>In one of the sessions, I said that I was <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/how-staying-in-a-job-you-hate-affects-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">worried about my professional life</a> and I had no idea what direction to go. I had graduated in advertising and had gone through dozens of jobs that I hated. I never lasted more than a few days in them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel like a failure,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what did you like to do to have fun when you were a kid?&#8221; my therapist said with a kind smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I loved to draw,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you thought about drawing again? See how you it feels? Maybe it&#8217;s a good idea and you find a new hobby,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>That day I went back to the house and immediately got a sheet of paper and a pencil. Without thinking much, I began to trace and was flooded with a sense of well-being. That was it!</p>
<p>Therapy has allowed me to have the profession I have today. Without the brilliant insight of my psychologist, I may not have found myself artistically and resumed my life normally.</p>
<p>Having someone professionally prepared to advise and suggest new points of view is really helpful and enlightening. I started practicing illustrations daily and with the help of my therapist, I got the courage to pursue a career as a professional illustrator. It not only gave me a purpose, but a deep self-knowledge and the ability to deal with adversities in a more mature way. Over time, I started to use my drawings to talk about my mental health, and this was what brought recognition and admirers to my work. I saw that I was not alone, and sharing my experience of therapy was a positive thing for myself and many others.</p>
<p>Later, when a long relationship ended, I already had a the tools to deal with the pain I felt. Just as I had found the path in my professional life with psychological help, I knew I would have the support to recover in my love life. I had several more sessions with my therapist, to help clearly realize how unhappy and stagnant I was, and to take advantage of the unique opportunity I was given to be myself completely — single, independent, and able to pursue my dreams.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I can say that <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_POST_INLINE&amp;utr_adgroup=therapy-helped-me-be-myself?utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/therapy-helped-me-be-myself" target="_blank">therapy has rebuilt me</a>. It helped me to observe and analyze my life and thoughts without so much judgment, and see things more lightly. I have become a much better person and will always be grateful for it. I continue to sit in the green armchair in that small room every week to talk, listen, and evolve a little more. And so life goes on.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the end of last summer, I had an existential crisis. I was about to turn 35, at a career crossroads, and on the verge of leaving the U.S. for good. I reflected back on how my adult years had been spent. They were self-serving, blurry and distant, and lacking deep personal connections with others. And myself.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d been living unhappily as a “man-child” — a lifestyle fueled by excessive partying and minimal commitment — for most of my adult life. Ashamed and disappointed I hadn’t accomplished more, I dwelled on squandered time and people I’d hurt along the way. I wanted to run from it all.</p>
<p>Rather than bouncing to Bangkok, however, I decided to clear my head. I was going to try an long-overdue experiment: a break from drinking. Half a year later, I’m still enjoying the positive benefits of that decision.</p>
<p><span id="more-9727"></span></p>
<h2>The Positives of a Drinking Break: a Conversation</h2>
<p>Since I’ve moved back to NYC, I’ll admit I’ve had a few social drinks. Lifetime sobriety wasn&#8217;t my endgame, but I wanted to see how far I could push it. I began to wonder if my taking a break was unique among the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/binge-drinking.htm" target="_blank">one in six US adults who binge drinks multiple times a month</a>.</p>
<p>In my first weeks at Talkspace, I learned that my content team co-conspirator, JoAnna Di Tullio, is on a similar break. I was interested to hear why she made the decision to take a drinking break, and what I could learn from her experience. Here&#8217;s our conversation&#8230;</p>
<h3>What was the moment or tipping point for the decision to take a break from drinking?</h3>
<p><b>JoAnna:</b> I think it was when I realized how much time I was spending drinking or recovering from a night out. I had been living in NYC for a little over a year at this point and I was having a conversation with my mom. She was asking me about what I had been doing for fun lately and if I was enjoying all that NYC had to offer (she’s in my hometown of LA). She asked me if I had been to the Highline, the Met, eaten Dim Sum in Chinatown&#8230; I hadn’t.</p>
<p>In fact, I hadn’t really been doing a whole lot other than touring the bar/party scene. I had been dating a guy who was a DJ so the party never really stopped. I realized that most of my “fun” adult-life experiences revolved around drinking, and that I wanted more out of life. And not for nothing, if I never suffered from another hangover again, I wouldn’t be mad.</p>
<p><b>Josh:</b> I feel you on the hangovers. They take me out the entirety of the following day. And don’t get me started on “hangxiety.”</p>
<p>To your point on enjoying NYC, I was in the camp that if I’m not buzzed on something, it’ll be boring. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/01/what-causes-social-anxiety/" target="_blank">It’s a social lubricant</a> for a social city. It think that plays into the larger decision to take more frequent breaks: realizing it&#8217;s ok to be your sober self.</p>
<p>My tipping point was one week that I went blackout three out of the five <i>weeknights</i>. I distinctly remember coming home after one night, looking in the mirror, and asking myself “Who are you?” That moment was a catalyst to leave a cushy job and get my mind right. I was hoping to re-discover myself before it was too late.</p>
<p>My most recent try at sobriety, which I opened with above, is related to being more present in relationships with others due to past mistakes in those arenas.</p>
<h3>The times you thought “I’m out of control”&#8230; was it a difficult conversation with yourself?</h3>
<p><b>JoAnna:</b> It’s always tough to look in the mirror and see the parts of yourself you’ve been trying to avoid. But I think this all ties back to just that –– avoidance. Drinking was a great way to distract myself from problems or questions that scared me.</p>
<p>But at a certain point that whisper became a roar and I had to get honest with myself: did I want to break out of old patterns and live a big life that I’m proud of? Or did I want to keep playing small because I was afraid of change?</p>
<p><b>Josh:</b> It’s <i>hard </i>to face yourself, and even harder to make a change. I think some people call it a “come to Jesus” moment. No matter your belief system, that moment is ultimately about not believing in yourself. If you don’t have <i>you</i>, what’s left?</p>
<p>I’ve been out of control at points, and the number of times I realized this and did nothing is staggering. I was a taker, and when I was drinking I could forget about relationship debts. I struggled with perfectionism, and scrutinized myself and my decisions to the point of paralysis. I needed to lose control to live, it seemed.</p>
<p>I’ve made progress on those fronts. Now it’s a matter of willpower and surrounding myself with more positive people and experiences.</p>
<h3>What keeps you focused on your health when tempted to head back out to the scene?</h3>
<p><b>JoAnna:</b> My health keeps me focused on my health! I feel so good these days. I’m still out and about. I go to bars with friends and dance the night away, but the difference is that the next day I wake up and can still have a full, productive day.</p>
<p>I’m an early riser and love the quiet of the mornings. I meditate. I write. I exercise. I wasn’t able to prioritize any of these things while in the throes of a hangover.</p>
<p><b>Josh:</b> From two desks away&#8230; you are honestly one of the healthier people I’ve met.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/5-ways-exercise-is-great-for-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">I’m in the gym 3-4 days a week now</a>. I meditate daily, if possible. Talkspace lets me balance work and life in an amazing way. I feel like I’ve hit the lottery, but have this lingering sadness, wishing I would have sought a clarity of mind sooner.</p>
<h3>How did your friends or family respond to this big change? Do you care either way?</h3>
<p><b>JoAnna:</b> I think some people were a little confused at first. But then it was no big deal. It’s funny, drinking is so ingrained in everything we do in our culture that at first, it’s hard to imagine what you <i>will</i> do if you’re <i>not</i> drinking.</p>
<p>The answer is, everything and more. It’s hard to imagine dinner without wine, or New Year’s Eve sans champagne, or a beach vacation without a tropical cocktail –– but once you do it, you realize that in a lot of ways, it can actually be a more enjoyable experience.</p>
<p><b>Josh:</b> Real talk regarding “drinking holidays.” It’s normalized to the point that there you get pushback from people if you <i>don’t</i> drink around occasions like NYE. I want that enjoyable experience you mentioned, and I want to feel the pain that comes with the less enjoyable experiences. That’s living, right?</p>
<p>It seems a lot of my relationships, and the people I surround myself with, like to party. I love my friends, and maybe I’m the bad friend for assuming we always have take the edge off somehow. I was nervous I’d get teased about it, but everyone was supportive.</p>
<p>My relationship with my immediate family has vastly improved. I’m more honest with them. I think my parents had similar discussions with themselves around my current age. They’re able to have a glass of wine or a margarita (or dos margaritas), and remain productive members of society. They set a good example.</p>
<h3>Have you had this discussion with your therapist?</h3>
<p><b>JoAnna:</b> Oh yes. I was going back and forth on it for a while. My therapist helped me realize that it’s something I could try for a little while and see how it goes. Guess what? The alcohol industry isn’t going anywhere.</p>
<p><b>Josh:</b> I’m actually restarting my therapy experience now using Talkspace. I haven’t had a therapist since I last lived in the city two years ago. I don’t think I was as up front about my “chemical romance” with my prior therapist as I should have been. Now I’m ready to openly discuss my problems without fear of judgement.</p>
<p>The difference in going it alone is that you don’t have that objective observer to help you with solutions. Trying to solve my own problems has been a minefield. I enjoy my time in therapy, it’s a completely positive experience.</p>
<h3>What are the major positives that have come out of this decision?</h3>
<p><b>JoAnna:</b> I think mostly how I feel. Not drinking has been amazing for managing anxiety. I also sleep better, have more energy, and overall am enjoying life more.</p>
<p>Another thing that’s come out of this is that my relationships have deepened in a way I would never have imagined. When you’re actually present and listening in a social setting… it’s revolutionary. I also feel a sense of empowerment and confidence that I didn’t have before. It’s all pretty wild to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Josh:</b> For me, it’s that <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/is-drinking-making-you-depressed/" target="_blank">I’m able to face my past, my problems, and myself</a>. It’s easily the most difficult thing I’ve done. It boils down to discipline, something I’ve been poor at historically. I’m proud I’m able to say no to things that do me harm, and yes to new experiences.</p>
<p>Another is the clarity of mind I thought I’d never experience. There’s always something brewing up there, but I’m better able to cope with, and talk through my issues. I feel less ashamed of who I am, and more hopeful for my future.</p>
<h3>What advice would you give to someone looking to take their own break?</h3>
<p><b>JoAnna:</b> It’s a deeply personal decision, so get honest with yourself. What are the reasons you want to do it? Trust yourself –– you know what’s best for you. And find your people. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/who-should-you-share-your-addiction-and-recovery-with/" target="_blank">Find the ones who support you, love you, and who are cheering for you</a>. The ones who are down to meet for tea and talk about stuff that matters. The ones who realize there’s more to life than the next party and being seen in the “right” places.</p>
<p>There might be people who give you a hard time about it –– they’re probably the ones who don’t deserve your energy. Another thing: get back to your roots. What were all the things you used to love to do but suddenly didn’t have time for anymore? For me it was reading, writing, and making art. What are all of the things you’ve wanted to do but didn’t have time for? Now’s the time.</p>
<p>But most of all, I’d say celebrate yourself. You’re going against the grain and doing something important for yourself. Be proud. Be fearless.</p>
<p><b>Josh:</b> Preach. Put yourself first, the rest will fall into place naturally. I started the journey trying to prove to someone else I could be the person they wanted me to be. I haven’t heard from that person since, nor do I expect I will again. It was a fool&#8217;s errand, but also the catalyst I needed to make actual changes. I realized I have many other people in my life who truly care about me and support my decisions.</p>
<p>One thing I’ll add is that it’s an amazing world out there, with nearly infinite experiences to be a part of. Because I was afraid to face life’s uncertainties, I missed out on some good years. I’m still working through how to enjoy things without a constant haze surrounding me.</p>
<h3>How can we continue to be supportive as friends, family, or co-workers?</h3>
<p><b>JoAnna:</b> By allowing people to make their own decisions judgement free. We don’t really know what’s going on with people, so coming at them with our opinions and advice, is sometimes not helpful.</p>
<p>Everyone has a right to do what’s best for themselves and we should all support one another in that pursuit.</p>
<p><b>Josh:</b> Like you said, support should be unconditional. The world would be a better place if we’d focus on being our best selves, rather than constantly expecting it of others.</p>
<p>That’s what I love about working at Talkspace: everyone is open and supportive. I know I’m pretty new to the team, but it feels familial. And not in that fake-y, startup-culture sense.</p>
<p>Thank you for being real, and having this conversation with me!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the darker times in my life came after the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/06/coping-with-grief-and-anxiety-in-the-wake-of-the-orlando-shooting/" target="_blank">mass shooting at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub</a>. It was the end of Albuquerque’s Pride weekend, a celebration of togetherness and community, but I quickly found myself feeling more isolated than ever. In times of tragedy, healthy people lean on others for support. I didn’t do that.</p>
<p>After a year of shutting out everybody who tried to care about me, I had nobody left to talk to. My best friend was in another city and my parents were in another state. All my friends were seeking solace with their families, their close friends, and their lovers, while I was attempting to drown out the collective sobs of my LGBTQ brothers and sisters with my one true love — work.</p>
<p>But misery doesn’t just love company, it needs it to heal. After a couple days of denial, I fell apart. All I wanted was a hug. I chose to seek comfort in people I thought were sure to know exactly how I felt: other gay men. Not quite finished with my poor life choices, I chose to connect with them on Grindr. I can say with great confidence that one-night flings with strangers will do nothing to fix loneliness.<span id="more-6876"></span></p>
<h2>Making Progress</h2>
<p>After the experience, I chose to abandon my independent, icy facade, and began connecting with my friends on a deeper level. I told them about what I’d been through during my abusive relationship. I told them I was <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/bipolar-disorder/" target="_blank">bipolar</a> and, for the first time in my life, admitted out loud that I was scared of what that meant for my life. I asked them for hugs, opinions, kind words, and inclusion. It paid off and I soon felt as loved and cared for as I ever had. I felt like I had a team who would go to bat for me. I felt like I belonged.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes to how much I needed to be around people who loved me. About a month later, I moved in order to live with my best friend. Six months after that, I met a man who would soon become my boyfriend. We’ve since moved in together, adopted a kitten, set joint goals, and even talked about kids and marriage someday. My life looks dramatically different than it did one year ago. I’ve learned to open up and show my vulnerability. I’ve even sobbed my eyes out while watching <em>Steel Magnolias</em> in front of him without feeling judged. I feel loved, supported, and connected.</p>
<p>I still talk to my best friend almost every day and I never go more than a week without talking to my parents. I’m now working as part of a team of more than 40 people and get to interact with my co-workers constantly.</p>
<p>But sometimes I still fall apart.</p>
<h2>The Sting of Abandonment</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/abusive-relationships-made-perfectionist/" target="_blank">first article I wrote for Talkspace</a> was about adjusting to the idea of being in a healthy relationship when all you’ve known is abuse and pain. It’s a scary concept to let someone in. It’s even scarier when you start to expect a certain standard of behavior. He’s always been open, honest, and upfront about his feelings. One afternoon, however, he let me down, and I forgot how to act in response.</p>
<p>Since meeting, we’ve had two arguments. One was fueled by a lack of sleep, starvation, a touch of heat stroke, and a nicotine craving, so we’ll focus on the other. This one involved hours of seething silence, uncontrollable sobbing, and an evacuation plan. He’d failed to explain a boundary to me, so when I crossed it, he snapped at me. I misinterpreted the situation. Rather than asking for clarification, I got angry, passive-aggressive, and silent. I don’t know about you, but I know what silent rage does to me and my thoughts.</p>
<p>I felt alone again, but this time feeling like I belonged to a group couldn’t fix it. I didn’t need my best friend, my co-workers, or my family. I only wanted to feel like my partner loved me.</p>
<p>Faith Hill talked about it in “Cry.” Cassadee Pope touched on it in “I Wish I Could Break Your Heart.” I craved a sign that told me he took me seriously. He didn’t show that sign. He was aggressively “fine” while I boiled over. It’s easy to feel abandoned by your partner when he or she chooses to put on a brave, stoic face while you lose your mind.</p>
<p>We got a moment alone and I immediately lashed out. I told him I was hurt, that I’d felt slighted and mistreated. When he shut down my attempt at a conversation, it felt like we were hopeless and trapped in a situation with no resolution. I was angry, and it seemed like he didn’t even care enough about me to be angry in return. A couple of hours later, when he tried to strike up a conversation about dinner, I snapped and begged him to “go be fine somewhere else.”</p>
<p>Eventually, I ended up crying on his shoulder and word-vomiting all the bad feelings I’d had that day. He explained his side with patience and fairness. That was enough to help me feel better. Still, it scares me that I can so easily slip back into the dark emotional spaces I thought I’d clawed out of. I know he loves me, and I’m mortified by how easy it was to convince myself otherwise.</p>
<h2>Potential</h2>
<p>I wish I could say that I’ve overcome my feelings of loneliness, my fear of abandonment, and all my other issues. In particular, I wish I could claim I’ve battled the demons on my own and learned to keep them at bay with positive self-reflection. But I haven’t. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">Therapy</a> has helped, but sometimes I still doubt I ever will.</p>
<p>I still assume the worst when it comes to conflict. I still begin mentally preparing to pack my bags when voices get louder and faces turn red. I don’t know if that will ever change or if I’ll ever stop escalating to hysterics in a heartbeat when my heart starts breaking. If you’re in my boat, I hope you’ll take comfort in knowing at least that I’m right there with you.</p>
<p>What I do know: I am more willing to open up about my feelings to the people around me. All the people in my life have proved I can trust them to be responsible, kind, and patient. They have shown that they take me and my suffering seriously, as seriously as my <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-its-like-to-use-talkspace-text-therapy-app-2015-3" target="_blank">therapist</a>. Most importantly, they’ve shown that they’ll stick around, even when things get rough.</p>
<p>Someday, I hope that I’ll be able to remember this even during the worst of times. Until then, I’ll rely on the moments of reassurance that come after the storm. It’s beautiful to give thanks for the people who show and prove their love.</p>
<p>As my boyfriend likes to say, life would be boring if we were always happy. Without loneliness, we wouldn’t know how it feels to belong and be at peace.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Talkspace’s Mental Health Diary series provides an intimate, anonymous week-long look inside the lives of those struggling with mental illness. Our first diary entry is from a Digital Content Producer and Journalist coping with the lingering effects of sexual abuse. Female // 30s // Los Angeles.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> PTSD; Secondary: borderline personality disorder, OCD, depression<br />
<strong>Occupation:</strong> Digital Content Producer; Journalist<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Los Angeles<br />
<strong>Medication:</strong> Luvox, Abilify, (Prozac); Xanax as needed<br />
<strong>Therapy:</strong> Two 90-minute in-person therapy sessions a week; Talkspace therapist; Bi-weekly trauma group therapy; Weekly DBT skills group<br />
<strong>Health Insurance:</strong> Cigna; (Blue Shield)</p>
<h2>DAY 1</h2>
<p><strong>7:45 a.m.</strong><br />
I get out of bed on the fifth alarm and throw on clothing to get out the door in 10 minutes or less to make it to work on time. Basic self-care stuff baffles me, so I do the best I can in jeans and some rumpled shirt that really should be washed.<span id="more-6512"></span></p>
<p><strong>9 a.m.</strong><br />
I’m at my full-time job and writing to my Talkspace therapist about not going to the grocery store because I have no idea how to feed myself and the whole thing is overwhelming. I’ve already checked on my cats via security camera twice — no catastrophes yet. I check on them at least every hour, making sure they’re safe, that my apartment didn’t burn down.</p>
<p><strong>3 p.m.</strong><br />
I wake up from a lunchtime nap. I don’t really remember what I was working on before lunch. It’s all a blur. Things have a way of blurring together and I don’t remember what I was doing.</p>
<p><strong>5 p.m.</strong><br />
My in-person therapist texts me and I get a jolt of panic. She is rescheduling my appointment from tonight to tomorrow. I am always afraid she is going to cancel my appointments and will abandon me.</p>
<p><strong>8 p.m.</strong><br />
I have been home from work a few hours and I read Roxane Gay’s Hunger, which touches on trauma and the way it forever impacts the body, mind, and soul. It’s nice to know I am not alone, and I find this book powerful, vulnerable, and all too relatable.</p>
<p><strong>10 p.m.</strong><br />
I’ve cleaned the litter box and taken my meds, but I can’t fall asleep despite the guided sleep meditation, which hilariously starts with a warning not to listen while operating heavy machinery.</p>
<p><strong>2:13 a.m.</strong><br />
Wake up and go back to sleep.</p>
<h2>DAY 2</h2>
<p><strong>6:40 a.m.</strong><br />
Wake up and go back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>7:35 a.m.</strong><br />
My first alarm goes off but I ignore it and the next one. At 7:45 I get ready for work, tired. I can’t forget to pay my rent, bring my recorder, or notebook. Rent, notebook, recorder. Rent, notebook, recorder, I repeat as I wash my face. I plug in the security camera, get down on my hands and knees to check on the cat under the bed. Fine. I throw on my sneakers and grab my bag and pet the other cat goodbye. I close and lock the apartment door, saying my mantra, “Please keep the cats safe, Lord.” I’m not religious. And then I am off, driving to work.</p>
<p><strong>10:30 a.m.</strong><br />
I bite my nails and try to catch up on the news. I scroll through headlines, check my email, start a project, check my email, check on the cats, check Facebook, write interview questions. I’m all over the place and uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>1 p.m.</strong><br />
I eat my food truck grilled cheese and fries, which I get so often the food truck people know my name. It comforts me and I am focused on work. Once I am absorbed in a task the anxiety falls away.</p>
<p><strong>5:30 p.m.</strong><br />
I leave work 30 minutes early for therapy, an 1.5 hour drive across the city in traffic.</p>
<p><strong>7:30 p.m.</strong><br />
Therapy. We talk about my fear of the grocery store and needing proper nutrients — or to be honest, any nutrients. We make a healthy shopping list for the store together. I struggle with the self-care — somehow high-level work tasks are easy, but simple things like brushing my teeth are difficult.</p>
<p>My psychiatrist missed my phone appointment earlier, so my therapist gets him on speakerphone while I list my symptoms from a list, my therapist filling in the gaps: trouble sleeping, flashbacks/weird dreams, panic/overwhelm, difficulty with self-care, isolation, avoidance, helplessness, dissociation, derealization, depersonalization, thought-blocking, slow cognitive processing, depression, racing thoughts, rage, lack of motivation/interest, agoraphobia, intrusive memories.</p>
<p>He adds Prozac to the Luvox and Abilify I am already taking. I close in on myself a little, feeling exposed and like a failure. I don’t like listing my symptoms because I am trying so hard to pretend everything is normal, that mental illness doesn’t impact my life. It does.</p>
<p><strong>10 p.m.</strong><br />
I am home from therapy. My cats chase each other while I agonize over what to do. I decide to tackle some work. I’m too wired for sleep right now anyway. Plus I didn’t eat dinner. I should do that, right?</p>
<p><strong>11 p.m.</strong><br />
Bedtime. My mind races. I want to keep working, panicked now. Work is how I avoid dealing with the harder thoughts and memories — I can drown them out with sheer willpower. I know I need to sleep though. I turn on the guided sleep meditation.</p>
<h2>DAY 3</h2>
<p><strong>5:55 a.m.</strong><br />
I have a dream I slept through all eight of my alarms and it’s now 9 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. I’m confused, and it takes me a couple minutes to reorient myself to the actual day and time.</p>
<p><strong>7:30 a.m.</strong><br />
I am afraid of the shower — it’s a trigger because of past experiences with my abuser — so I wash my hair and face leaning over the tub. I am ahead of schedule so I message my Talkspace therapist and pet the cats.</p>
<p><strong>1 p.m.</strong><br />
I don’t know where the time’s gone since I got to work. I dissociate and lose small amounts of time regularly. I guess I’ve been writing and editing. I feel self-conscious in my shirt — it’s too revealing with its short sleeves and V-neck. I feel safer completely covered in baggy clothing.</p>
<p><strong>3:45 p.m.</strong><br />
I’m feeling a lot of anxiety. I use the STOP skill — stop, take a step back, observe, proceed mindfully — and focus on breathing. I don’t know what’s wrong, but things feel wrong. I check on the cats just in case.</p>
<p><strong>5:25 p.m.</strong><br />
The pharmacy can’t fill my new prescription without my new insurance information. When I try to log in to register online for a temporary ID card, it says the site is down for maintenance. I hate switching insurance. I’m privileged to have health insurance, and lucky I can work. Between my salary, insurance, and support from my parents, I can afford a lot of therapy, all of which I need to keep me stable. Everybody deserves this level of care. I just got lucky.</p>
<p><strong>8:30 p.m.</strong><br />
I’m home, my head on my desk, cat curled up in my arms, my computer open. I sorted out my prescription and am facing a pile of freelance work. I hear this internal screaming and I feel the need to self-injure, but I urge surf, the technique of letting an urge build until it crests and recedes, without acting on my desire. I hear the screaming in my head, feel the distress. My foot jiggles under my desk, channeling the excess energy. I try to work a little.</p>
<p><strong>9:34 p.m.</strong><br />
Bedtime, meditation app in hands. I don’t know if I took my meds or not. I’m having a hard time calming down.</p>
<p><strong>9:43 p.m.</strong><br />
I move to the couch and pull my weighted blanket over myself, which helps calm down the nervous system, turning down the fight-or-flight response.</p>
<p><strong>10:17 p.m.</strong><br />
Move back to bed. My thoughts are racing and I still can’t sleep.</p>
<p><strong>3:40 a.m.</strong><br />
Wake up, go back to sleep.</p>
<h2>DAY 4</h2>
<p><strong>6:05 a.m.</strong><br />
Wake up, start freelance work with my cat curled up on the desk.</p>
<p>8:50 a.m.<br />
I’m at my job and writing two articles peacefully, the absorption leaving me anxiety-free for the moment.</p>
<p><strong>12 p.m.</strong><br />
I decide I should cancel the meditation class I signed up for tonight so I have more time to work. I’m really anxious, again. I take some Xanax to slow down because I am feeling out of control.</p>
<p><strong>4 p.m.</strong><br />
The Xanax makes me sleepy, so I sleep for 30 minutes during a late lunch.</p>
<h2>DAY 5</h2>
<p><strong>6:00 a.m.</strong><br />
I lost an entire night because the Xanax knocked me out. I don’t remember much about getting home yesterday and I fell asleep fully clothed on the couch with the light on. I finally wake up when my alarm goes off. I am still tired, so I hit snooze.</p>
<p><strong>7:15 a.m.</strong><br />
I have off from my full-time job today, a bonus company summer holiday, but I am still up early to work.</p>
<p><strong>9:15 a.m.</strong><br />
I’m waiting on an apartment inspection and very anxious since I have to leave for therapy soon. I can’t leave until the inspection happens because I can’t risk the cats escaping because some strangers leave my apartment door open. My cats are my lifelines, and I pathologically obsess over their safety.</p>
<p><strong>10:20 a.m.</strong><br />
The quick apartment inspection is over and I am still on time. I feel pretty good right now.</p>
<p><strong>11:30 a.m.</strong><br />
I have my second 90-min therapy session of the week. We talk about how I can make a life worth living by doing activities other than work and therapy. I’ve been avoiding anything with people and prefer to stay in my apartment with the cats as much as possible where it’s safe. Apparently this isn’t what life is supposed to be like. The more ideas we brainstorm, the more overwhelmed I feel. My therapist says fun things will help me feel better about life. I know she’s right, but I am afraid.</p>
<p><strong>1:15 p.m.</strong><br />
I stop at McDonald’s on the way to the doctor’s appointment I scheduled about losing weight. Oops?</p>
<p><strong>2:30 p.m.</strong><br />
At the doctor’s office, I hand my doctor the medical excuse form for jury duty first. I testified against my sexual abuser in several court hearings, and jury duty is a huge trigger I can’t handle right now. Just going to the court to get the medical excuse brought on panic attacks and flooded emotions and memories last week. I can’t do it. She signs my form.</p>
<p>Then we talk about the weight issue. I’ve heard most of it before, about plant-based eating and shopping around the edges of the store, and tracking what I eat. My doctor is kind, helpful, and not shaming, so I appreciate this.</p>
<p><strong>4:30 p.m.</strong><br />
Having a successful day so far, I decide to keep the momentum going — laundry. I haul the mini washing machine out of the closet, so I don’t have to go to the laundromat where there are people. I put the first load in the tiny washer, set it for 9 minutes and poke around the apartment, waiting. I hope to stuff all my laundry into just three loads. (The washing machine can only handle 11 pounds at a time.) Laundry overwhelms me and I just want to get it over with.</p>
<p><strong>7:45 p.m.</strong><br />
I survive a trip to the grocery store! I get almost everything on the list my therapist and I made. I may not care about my body — to be overweight is to be invisible and that means creepy dudes leave me alone — but all the sugar I usually eat ramps up my PTSD. My therapist didn’t mince words. I can’t get better if I don’t eat better.</p>
<p><strong>10 p.m.</strong><br />
The grocery store knocked me out and I haven’t gotten any work done. I read, take my new meds, now six pills in all, and go to sleep.</p>
<h2>DAY 6</h2>
<p><strong>6 a.m.</strong><br />
The alarm goes off. I dream my abuser is allowed to come back to school and teach like nothing happened, like he didn’t abuse a student, and nobody believes me when I say he’s dangerous. The dream makes me tired and disoriented, so I reset my alarm for later.</p>
<p><strong>6:30 a.m.</strong><br />
Alarm goes off. I reset it for later.</p>
<p><strong>8 a.m.</strong><br />
Alarm goes off. I thought it was supposed to go off earlier. I am confused and a little panicked I can’t remember why the earlier alarm didn’t go off. Even when I lose time and forget something mundane, it’s still disconcerting. What else have I missed? I get up and shower.</p>
<p><strong>8:27 a.m.</strong><br />
The work I am supposed to be doing isn’t due until midnight, so I give up, too tired to do anything now.</p>
<p><strong>9 a.m.</strong><br />
I call in to my Dialectical Behavioral Therapy skills group, which teaches mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotional regulation, and distress tolerance skills for people like me who self-injure or otherwise struggle to manage emotions. When it’s my turn to share, I talk about working on the PLEASE skill — treat physical illness, eat, avoid mood-altering substances, sleep, and exercise — with my new healthy eating mission.</p>
<p><strong>12 p.m.</strong><br />
Today marks three months exactly without self-injury. To celebrate I am getting a new tattoo, a color madala my brother designed. My tattoo artist works on my arm, covering cigarette burn scars in the process. It looks amazing when it’s done.</p>
<p><strong>3 p.m.</strong><br />
I am back home and hungry. I eat a salad but I really want sugar. I don’t feel like doing any work, so I listen to an audiobook, Carrie Fisher’s The Princess Diarist, while playing a Frozen game on my phone. It’s my favorite combination of distraction skills to keep me calm.</p>
<p><strong>7 p.m.</strong><br />
My parents call from the east coast and tell me about their dinner party. I tell them about my tattoo. They are proud of my 90 days without self-injury. So am I. We talk for over an hour.</p>
<p><strong>10 p.m.</strong><br />
I can’t really remember what I had been doing, but I am tired. I roll over on the couch and fall asleep, still dressed with the light on.</p>
<p><strong>12 a.m.</strong><br />
I wake up, think I should move to my bed or at least turn the light off but I turn over and immediately fall back asleep.</p>
<p><strong>3:26 a.m.</strong><br />
I wake up again and this time get off the couch, feed the cats, put on pajamas, and turn out the light. It crosses my mind I have forgotten to take my meds (this happens at least twice a week) but I am too tired to care. I fall back asleep.</p>
<h2>DAY 7</h2>
<p><strong>6:31 a.m.</strong><br />
Wake up again, fall back asleep.</p>
<p><strong>7:40 a.m</strong>.<br />
Wake up again, fall back asleep.</p>
<p><strong>8:31 a.m.</strong><br />
Wake up again, check my email, fall back asleep.</p>
<p><strong>9:30 a.m.</strong><br />
Decide I should stay awake to work. I will tackle my article first. I don’t know how to write the intro. I’m worried it will be terrible and I have no idea what I am doing, but I can’t avoid it forever, the deadline technically already past. I’m hungry, but I hate all the healthy food in my apartment, so I choose not to eat.</p>
<p><strong>1 p.m.</strong><br />
I’ve squeaked out a draft of the article, though it took forever and it’s way too long. I realize part of the reason writing this article is so hard is because I’m writing about dating. Any mention of dating or sex brings up unwanted memories and past fears — intimacy means unwanted sexual advances and abuse. It always triggers me.</p>
<p><strong>2 p.m.</strong><br />
I go to an individual meditation session. I tell my teacher how I’m trying to calm down my overactive fight-or-flight response while also trying to open up and express my emotions. We talk about skills that can help and decide it’s time to start a daily meditation practice. We’ll see how that goes.</p>
<p><strong>4:15 p.m.</strong><br />
I stand in line at Starbucks to get my coveted midnight mint mocha frappuccino. It’s not on the healthy eating plan, but since I skipped lunch, there is plenty of room on the calorie scale.</p>
<p><strong>4:30 p.m.</strong><br />
I Skype with my brother, sister-in-law, and young nephew. I don’t really know what to say — my life is so small and boring, so it’s a short conversation. I can’t very well talk about all my therapy or how the grocery store overwhelms me. I love seeing them though. I hope I get better at connecting and talking one of these days because I want them in my life.</p>
<p><strong>7:45 p.m.</strong><br />
I realize I should shower. I can’t muster up the courage or the energy for that, so I wash my hair and face instead. I check my email before settling in on the couch to listen to a new audiobook, Jennifer Traig’s Devil In The Details, and play Frozen.</p>
<p><strong>9 p.m.</strong><br />
I deem work finished for the day and I don’t have energy for anything else. I message my Talkspace therapist one last time, feed and water the cats, take my meds, and hop into bed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This story is a part of our Mental Health Confessions series, a collection of stories from people who open up about times they felt guilty or conflicted about their mental health issue.</em></p>
<p>I’m pretty tolerant of most types of people, but I absolutely hate flakes. I have cut off friendships because I can’t deal with others’ flakiness, especially when it comes down to repeated incidents of bailing on plans at the last minute.</p>
<p>However, some might say I’m a hypocrite. Why? My mental illness, at times, causes me to become the very type of person I hate.</p>
<p>Friendship is a two-way street. We expect our friends to put in the same amount of time and emotional labor into maintaining a relationship as we do ourselves. Of course, we know this isn’t always the case, and I’ll be the first to admit it: with some of my friends, I feel like I am giving less than I’m getting. I’ve flaked on even the best of my best friends, and I fear one day they’ll decide to cut me loose because of it.<span id="more-6458"></span></p>
<p>My diagnoses are Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Both of these mental illnesses can — and usually do — present with a slew of physical symptoms on top of all the mental ones (as if feelings of impending doom and chronic worry weren’t enough). If I’m going through a rough patch, there’s likely plenty of horrible thoughts and physiological sensations that are nagging at me, holding me back from something as simple as a lunch date.</p>
<p>It all started at age 11 when I moved to a new town and developed my anxiety disorder. I was constantly plagued by symptoms like stomach aches and chest pains, and I had no idea how to cope with what I was feeling. These ailments caused me to skip out on nearly every birthday party or outing I was invited to, which led to even more anxiety.</p>
<p>How was I going to make friends in a new town if I never socialized? Even if I was feeling alright on the day of an event, I still bailed because I was anticipating having a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/anxiety-attack-vs-panic-attack-one/" target="_blank">panic attack</a> there. Staying home and being bored would be better than having a breakdown in front of peers. Sometimes, at age 24, I still have the same thought.</p>
<p>I remember one day, years later, I laid on my floor for about three hours hysterically crying, hating myself, and hating the cards I had been dealt in life. Over and over, I asked myself, “Why me?” Family members came knocking on my door to check on me and I screamed at them to leave. I was supposed to be participating in a breast cancer walk with my best friend and a team that had been assembled, but I couldn’t get off the floor, let alone stop my tears. I sent her the kind of text I dread receiving right before a scheduled plan.</p>
<p><em>“I’m so sorry, but I don’t think I can make it&#8230;”</em></p>
<p>Of course I elaborated about how I was in a horrible state of mind, but I was so embarrassed and ashamed that I didn’t feel strong enough to push through the feelings, leave the house, and go to the walk. I was a flake, and my mental illness was my excuse.</p>
<p>I’m self-deprecating enough, and doing this — annoying my friends, letting them down — makes me even harder on myself. No matter how many times they say, “Don’t worry, I totally understand! There’s always next time!” I can’t help but be overcome with guilt.</p>
<p>So, I know, we all hate flakes, and we hate excuses. We often question if the excuses are some extravagant lie (or is that just me and my trust issues?). But maybe we should cut these people some slack. If someone <em>does</em> truly suffer from mental illness, their flakiness comes with good reason.</p>
<p>I hope that one day I’ll be able to push through the thoughts and feelings that keep me from doing everything I want to do, that mental illness will not hold me back and will no longer be an excuse.</p>
<p>Until then, please bear with my flakiness.</p>

<p><em>It’s 7am and I’ve already burned 1,000 calories on the elliptical. I’m packing up my food for the day. Breakfast is 113 calories for 3 egg whites and 1 cup of grapes. Lunch will be 131 calories for turkey, mustard, lettuce, and baby carrots. I’ve also packed 1 pack of Parliament Lights, 4 Diet Cokes, 1 gallon of water, and 1 brand new pack of bubblemint gum. I’ll have dance class in the afternoon, which takes care of another 300 or so calories. Dinner is always a wild card –– it depends on who’s around and how carefully I’m being watched. I have food saved in my room for later just in case. I am 16 years old and 70 pounds; I am a human calorie counter and numbers genius who, ironically, is also struggling in Pre-Calculus.</em></p>
<p>Looking back, it’s hard to pinpoint a clear start for all of this. Unlike an alcoholic who can often describe their first drink, there was no concrete “first.” My eating disorder was a physical manifestation of a longtime underlying condition. It was some combination of perfectionism, extreme sensitivity, fear, and ironically enough a hunger –– a hunger for love, acceptance, validation. A hunger for everything. That hunger felt unmanageable so instead of learning how to experience it, I taught myself how to stop it, to cut it off, to starve it out. If you don’t want anything, you can never get hurt, right?<span id="more-6413"></span></p>
<p>Aside from a cracked internal landscape, there were plenty of external circumstances that fed my food obsession. I lived on the westside of Los Angeles –– a part of town that’s known for lavish living, celebrities, plastic surgery, and an impossible standard of beauty. It’s a town that’s flanked with billboards about freezing off your fat, entire stores dedicated to “diet” food, hypnotists ready to convince you that you will no longer be hungry by the time you reopen your eyes, and people jumping to tell you how amazing you look the skinnier you are (while secretly hating you). That can dent the psyche of even the strongest mental warrior, but when you’re a teenager and confused about everything and desperately looking for anything that makes sense –– LA is not your friend, it’s a fucking toxic playground.</p>
<p>My days were marked by careful planning, rigid scheduling, and predictable manufactured moments. Anything beyond &#8220;the plan&#8221; threw me for a loop and I couldn’t deal. I&#8217;d weigh myself, decide whether it was a good or bad day based on what the scale said, plan my food, go to school, see a doctor or a nutritionist, lie to said doctor or nutritionist, go home, lie about what I ate all day, give some bullshit about how the doctor said I was &#8220;making progress,&#8221; concoct a way out of dinner then disappear into my room. It was a sad, small existence, but it was how I managed.</p>
<p>Lots of anorexics experience trauma earlier in life that leads them to a place of craving this level of control. I didn&#8217;t have that. I was just a deeply sensitive person who felt a lot and didn&#8217;t know what to do with those feelings. I carried on in this way for years. My parents were freaked out and had no idea what to do with me. My mom would often tell me that I looked like an AIDS patient and wondered if it was drugs that were doing this.</p>
<p>With my rolodex of doctors and specialists increasing by the week, my main psychiatrist was pushing for inpatient treatment. I, of course, had a million reasons why that was unnecessary and in true anorexic fashion, was always able to manipulate my parents to agree with me. The question of college came up. I had gotten into a top east coast university. My doctors strongly recommended that I stay back and take a gap year to get my health in order. By this time, my physical state was at its worst. It was getting harder for me to physically do simple tasks. Once the body burns through fat, it feeds on muscles…like the heart. For the first time I agreed with my doctors, but I was too frightened to speak up. So when my parents said maybe a change of scenery would make all of this better, I believed them.</p>
<p><em>On Tuesdays I meet with Mary, the Beverly Hills nutritionist who has me writing down everything I eat. I quickly fill in my food logs, lying as I add in handfuls of almonds and tablespoons of peanut butter (two things that will thrill her). I promised everyone I would focus on getting my weight up before I take off for school. I weigh myself before the appointment. I’ve lost 3 more pounds. The sick part of the mind is overjoyed, but the rational side panics and I get an instant stomach ache. I am so screwed. I quickly run downstairs where my mom stores all of our exercise equipment and grab a few small weights. I stash them in my bag as I head off to the appointment. I always wear a hospital gown during my weigh ins so they can get an “accurate” read which makes it easy to hide the weights under my arms. Mary is so kind and I can tell she genuinely wants to help, but she’s a little oblivious and doesn’t think to check for anything that could tip the scale. I step on, and breathe a quick sigh of relief as she congratulates me on the weight gain. I know it’s a lie, so why am I so upset to see the number increase?</em></p>
<p>One day, I walked in the front the door and my mom was waiting for me in the kitchen. I’ll never forget the look of horror that was flashing across her face. She told me that Jackie, my high school guidance counselor had called to tell my mom that I had been hiding weights under my arms. Jackie was one of the few people I trusted during this time. She would pull me out of classes to hang out in her office and talk and sometimes she would let me smoke cigarettes out in the alley. I told her most of my secrets but instantly regretted sharing this one. The discovery of this lie was the final straw. I had officially frayed everyone’s last nerve.</p>
<p>Fall rolled around and I took off for the east coast. I was committed to changing my ways and starting fresh in a new city. For the first few days, things did seem to get a little better. I had been going to the dining hall (which for anorexics is kind of like swimming with sharks) and was actually eating! But then something switched –– I had been flying high, without any structure, but finally got a little too close to the sun. I started to lose control and started bingeing. It was almost as though the years of starvation had finally caught up. I wasn’t just hungry –– I was absolutely insatiable.</p>
<p>I went on a three week long binge. I don’t remember much of it, just a few flashes of floating in and out of restaurants and cafes, ordering and eating, and then heading to the next spot. I remember a few failed attempts at trying to tell my mom and therapist what was going on, but I was paralyzed by fear. Then one day I finally found some inkling of courage to send the text, “Mom, I’m not okay. I need to come home.”</p>
<p>That night, I landed in the hospital. I don’t remember anything from those few days other than the sound of my mom’s shoes walking quickly down the hospital hallway. Needless to say, I got my wish. I went home.</p>
<p>For the next year I was in an intensive treatment program where I got serious about my recovery. I went to individual therapy, family therapy, group therapy where we held stones that had words like “hope” and “love” etched on them, nutrition class, group meals, individual meals, group outings –– it was all about learning basic living skills. It was learning how to cope, how to feel, how to be okay amidst the inevitable chaos of life. It was learning how to love myself and how to show up for others.</p>
<p>Recovery is life-long. There is no magic moment where you’re suddenly better. Relapse is extremely common in eating disorders and I was no exception. But through continued therapy, self care, meditation, and mindfulness, I am able to stay the course and live in a way that’s authentic and healthy. I have bad days where I feel the pull towards that path of self-destruction. But today I also have choices.</p>
<p>If I had to share a message with anyone who’s suffering, I would tell them to surrender their control and take a leap into the unknown. I would tell them that what’s waiting on the other side of their fear is a life that’s beyond their wildest dreams. Life can be beautiful and rich and exciting and scary and wild and passionate and uncomfortable and messy and it is all so worth it. All you have to do it live one day at time and you’ll be amazed by the strength you can muster when you get out of your own way.</p>

<p>Images flash back through my mind.</p>
<p>I am locked in a dark office in the corner of another locked room during a free class period of the high school day. I&#8217;m balanced precariously on the edge of a desk with my legs wrapped around his body, the bulge in his pants gyrating in the crook between my legs. My mind wanders and eventually lands on my aching muscles, my trembling arms and legs. They&#8217;re not going to hold much longer.</p>
<p>He is standing fully clothed, his usual beat-up brown loafers planted on the floor. I smell his Cheer-washed dress shirt and Dial soap-scrubbed skin. His Docker’s are hemmed a couple inches too short. He is 43. I am 17. Those loafers rise and fall off the floor with every thrust of his crotch into me, the friction of fabric on fabric a barely noticeable sensation. All my attention focuses on my awkward position on this desk — my muscles ache and burn in protest.</p>
<p>He grinds away, oblivious in ecstasy, his face turned upwards, making those moaning sounds. Finally, my body overrides my mental willpower to stay upright and my muscles collapse. I start to fall off the desk, headed toward the floor, before he catches me and props me back on the desk.</p>
<p>Other memories follow.<span id="more-6124"></span></p>
<p>My first kiss is stolen away behind the beat-up upright piano. There&#8217;s nothing romantic about it. He pushes into my face until it hurts.</p>
<p>I am yanked out of a shower like a puppet and thrown on top of some towels on the hotel bathroom floor. His naked pelvis grinds on my back until he finishes.</p>
<p>I lie on the gray sleeping bag fully clothed while he looms overhead. With him on top of me I am suffocating. I can&#8217;t breathe.</p>
<p>Flash forward nearly 15 years.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t breathe. I sit on the edge of the tub in the bathroom, a plastic bag tight over my head. I only realize my predicament when my diaphragm starts spasming from the lack of oxygen.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t remember how I got there, on the edge of the tub, trying to suffocate myself out of existence. My mind is blank, save for getting home from work several hours earlier. It&#8217;s not a surprise I find myself in this position, nor is it unusual at this point. I don&#8217;t look forward to reporting this incident to my <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a>, again.</p>
<p>My therapist says I have PTSD, and the two therapists before her agreed. According to the <a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/ptsd-overview/basics/what-is-ptsd.asp" target="_blank">National Center for PTSD</a>, post-traumatic stress disorder includes four categories of symptoms, including reliving the event, avoiding situations that remind you of the event, having more negative beliefs in general, and feeling &#8220;keyed up.&#8221;</p>
<p>I experience all of these, and they were what got me into therapy in the first place. I can’t point to a specific moment that spurred me to action, but I know something isn’t right, that I shouldn&#8217;t feel the way I do. I am supposed to want to live. Something in me wants to survive, so despite my general hopelessness I try to find professional help. It’s either that or die, really. I cycle through 10 therapists, quitting and starting over each time, before I find one who understands what happened to me and who can really help.</p>
<p>When I start <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a> with my current therapist, I think I handle my symptoms pretty well — I hold down a job, put on a good face for friends and family, and generally keep functioning.</p>
<p>Yet this notion quickly unravels as we discover my <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxiety</a> runs sky-high. I frequently feel like nothing is real, like I live in a movie. I dissociate and there’s a lot I avoid. I self-injure away any overwhelming feelings, which is most of them. I can barely shower regularly, and I eat only french fries and cookies for lunch and dinner, respectively. I avoid people and stay in my apartment as much as possible. I don’t plan on living past 30.</p>
<p>This combination eventually lands me in the hospital at the strong urging of my therapist, a trauma recovery program that proves to be a turning point. It sets me at position “zero” on my recovery journey. This is an improvement from the constant drowning sensation of my prehospital existence.</p>
<p>Not only do I <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/recognizing-trauma-vs-ptsd-quick-primer-symptoms/" target="_blank">learn about PTSD</a> and skills to manage my mental illness, I meet other people like me at various stages of recovery. From them, I realize I want to learn to be close to people again, to feel present, to live my whole life. I want to escape the shadow of sexual abuse and the resulting PTSD.</p>
<p>Despite my general impatience, this does not happen overnight. After leaving the hospital, I still struggle with suicidality and self-injury. The problem is the anxiety and overwhelm, that feeling of being “keyed up,” or as my therapist would say, my alarm system going off all the time.</p>
<p>At the time of a traumatic event, the body and brain go into survival mode, cutting off emotions and memories automatically, without any thought on the part of the victim. These defenses are baked into the very physiology of what it means to be a living animal. That doesn’t mean the fear, sadness, pain, terror, anger, rage, or helplessness disappear, even if we can’t feel them in the moment. They’re only stored for processing when we’re safe.</p>
<p>When trauma reoccurs or isn’t fully processed after the event, PTSD is often the result. To heal, those memories frozen in temporary storage need to be moved through the body and brain to bring us back to equilibrium. It takes time to be ready to do this. In fact, most people aren’t ready until 15 to 30 years later. It’s not a small thing. This is why short statutes of limitations are cruel to victims — when they are finally ready to deal with the trauma, their recourse in court is already long over. Lucky for the offenders.</p>
<p>Many of my feelings are old, I learn, and as I begin to thaw, these will come to the surface and look like the truth. Really, they’re just echos from the past, emotions that were never felt, suspended in time until I could handle them. I have a hard time getting used to this, because they feel so real. PTSD makes it hard to tell the past from the present.</p>
<p>Eventually I am strong enough to give up suicide, and later self-injury. I commit to never putting another plastic bag over my head again. I find the courage to face the past without these old tools, trying to create new neural pathways in my brain that will steer me clear of PTSD. The progress is slow, but I start to gain traction, start to learn I can handle my emotions, that I can recover. There is maybe hope after all.</p>
<p>There’s a before trauma and an after trauma. I will never be the same person as before. My meditation teacher agrees: “No, nothing is ever the same after trauma.” She says it so simply and with so much acceptance. I want to find that much acceptance for myself, for my past, present, and future. I will never be the same person, but I potentially have my whole life ahead of me. I’ve let my abuser take up space for too long. I am not going to give him another minute.</p>
<p>As the clock ticks past the 15-year mark since the abuse started, I’m learning to appreciate how my PTSD symptoms are tied to my survival, from the dissociation, feeling unreal, extreme anxiety, and even the self-injury. This knowledge does not make recovery easier, but it helps me be a little more patient with myself when I don’t feel up to socializing like my friends do, or I have days when I am too tired to get out of bed.</p>
<p>While I have made progress, with no small thanks to my killer support team, there’s still a lot of work to do. But I look forward to the day when these old memories no longer cause a five-alarm emotional meltdown that can last days. I know my life will be mine again, my PTSD symptoms will lessen and these old stories will be just that — stories.</p>
