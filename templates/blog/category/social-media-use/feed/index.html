				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a majority of us, our relationship with social media is relegated to a cheeky glance at our phone over a break at the office, or plopping down on the couch for a few swipes down the ol’ timeline. Others complain they spend too much time on “Insta” by spending hours liking the day’s spiciest memes, or obsessively replaying a random dog’s “stories.” When excessive social media use crosses into unhealthy territory, it can <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/05/18/how-heavy-use-of-social-media-is-linked-to-mental-illness" target="_blank">affect mental health</a>.</p>
<p>But what if social media is <i>literally</i> your job? Does a daily mission to be constantly present and engaged on social lead to similar behavior after hours? Our social media manager at Talkspace, JoAnna Di Tullio, shared a diary of how running social media for a popular brand affects her social media intake, and if she’s ever able to truly disengage from “the scroll.”</p>
<p><span id="more-10299"></span></p>
<h2>A Social Media Manager&#8217;s Daily Diary</h2>
<h3>5 a.m.</h3>
<p>First alarm goes off. I’m exhausted after spending the night tossing and turning (thanks <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/the-surprising-new-connection-between-sleep-and-mental-health/" target="_blank">insomnia</a>). I hit snooze.</p>
<h3>5:03 a.m.</h3>
<p><i>Snooze.</i></p>
<h3>5:04 a.m.</h3>
<p><i>Snooze.</i></p>
<h3>5:05 a.m.</h3>
<p><i>Snooze</i> (yes, I am this person).</p>
<h3>5:15 a.m.</h3>
<p>Okay, okay, okay, I’m up. I grab my phone as if on autopilot and start my initial morning phone checks: texts, weather, bank, emails, and last but not least, <a href="http://instagram.com/talkspace" target="_blank"><i>Instagram</i></a>. I do a quick feed scroll and watch the first few stories that appear. I always look forward to my initial morning social check to see what rolled in while I was asleep. It’s like a little rush.</p>
<p>Make no mistake about it, social media is addictive. I let myself get lost for a few minutes before I get up to caffeinate and work out.</p>
<h3>8:15 a.m.</h3>
<p>Waiting for the L train (the working title of my memoir). I’m standing on a subway platform in a sea of Brooklynites all waiting to cram on to the next jam-packed train into Manhattan –– everyone is equally tired and frustrated yet sedated by the cool blue light of their phones.</p>
<p>I catch a glimpse of the girl standing next to me who is filming a Snapchat story, the dude to my right is <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/09/4-tips-to-stop-social-media-from-killing-your-intimate-relationship/" target="_blank">Facebook stalking</a> what looks like a possible love interest…everywhere around me is the aimless scroll, the blank looks, the lack of human connect.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m guilty of the same behavior but it still gets me down sometimes. Ahhh, it’s going to be one of those days.</p>
<h3>9:10 a.m.</h3>
<p>I roll in to work, large coffee in hand, and get ready to settle in to the day. I run social media and brand partnerships at Talkspace, so you could say I’m pretty “in it” as far as the digital world goes.</p>
<p>Social can be a double-edged sword. There’s so much good it can do –– it has the power to connect, inspire, teach, and organize people. I know a girl who was separated from her twin sister at birth and almost 25 years later reconnected all because of Facebook. Following the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/how-we-can-heal-after-this-horrible-election-cycle/">election of President Trump</a>, women connected across all social channels to organize a march that drew nearly 5 million participants worldwide. In fact, social media has been one of the quickest and most efficient means of rallying people around causes, for better or for worse (see the 2017 election results).</p>
<p>It’s a powerful force –– use it at your own risk.</p>
<h3>11 a.m.</h3>
<p>By now I’ve checked notifications on all of our accounts, responded to customer inquiries, and queued up content for the day. I love this aspect of my job –– getting to connect with people who are looking to improve their lives and sharing ways to do it.</p>
<p>As a long-time participant in <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/">therapy</a> myself, I believe deeply in our mission to de-stigmatize therapy and increase access to mental health care. I feel grateful for the opportunity to work for a company that’s disrupting the mental health space and focusing on how technology can be used as a force for good.</p>
<h3>12 p.m.</h3>
<p>Before I grab lunch I check back in on our notifications to make sure nothing has popped up that needs attention. Social media is often the first line of contact between Talkspace and our users so it’s really important that I stay attentive and connected.</p>
<p>But if I’m being fully transparent here, between the allure of the endless scroll and the voyeuristic element, it’s hard not to fall down a rabbit hole:<i> “This person got back together with who?!” </i>And, “<i>This dress looks so beautiful against the backdrop of the South of France.” </i>And, <i>“Look at how colorful this Acai bowl is!”</i> Next thing I know, I’m unsure where the past 25 minutes have gone. Sound familiar?</p>
<h3>2 p.m.</h3>
<p>Around this point in the afternoon is where I start to get restless. My energy dips, I’m slightly irritable, and my focus starts to wane. It’s particularly bad on days when I haven’t given myself a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/07/does-social-media-have-you-in-a-cage/" target="_blank">proper screen break</a> (something I really need to work on).</p>
<p>We have the NYC luxury of working next to Central Park –– a perk that in warmer months provides the perfect place to take a little mental break. The key here is to not find my way to the park only to get lost in my Instagram feed again…The struggle is real!</p>
<p>I go through periods of time where I am really vigilant about my own social media use. I deactivated my personal Facebook account a few years ago, following a tough break up. I only set out to take a month long break, but after a month I realized that I felt happier and less anxious so I stayed off “the ‘book.” I don’t regret this decision; in fact, I recommend everyone take a break from Facebook! Yes, this social media manager is telling you to get the hell off social media!</p>
<h3>4 p.m.</h3>
<p>Energy starts to spike back up and I feel the immediate urge to check my personal Instagram. I resist. It’s hard, but necessary.</p>
<p>I’ve noticed more and more how Instagram has a numbing effect. Feeling bored? Sad? Scared? Angry? Lonely? Tired? Get lost in a world of influencers, exotic vacations, and 6-pack abs. Sorry, am I beginning to sound like a cynic here? It’s the inevitable truth of a day spent hovering over a tiny screen.</p>
<h3>6 p.m.</h3>
<p>Getting ready to wrap up and call it a day. I take a quick scan of my to-do list. Not bad, got through the non-negotiables and a few of the bigger picture items.</p>
<p>I have to admit, some days I feel like I don’t get as much done as I could have. When I trace back to the culprit it’s usually because of excessive time spent on social media. It’s a real catch-22 for someone whose job it is to be on social media all day….</p>
<h3>9 p.m.</h3>
<p>Finally home and settling in for the evening. After work, I make it a point to do something physically social, whether it’s a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/take-mental-health-vacation-7-ways/" target="_blank">yoga class with a friend</a>, dinner, or hanging out with friends. It’s something that I prioritize after a day spent at work and online.</p>
<p>Around this time is usually when I try to write (in an actual journal) and meditate. The goal here is to resist the urge to pick up my phone. Lately I’ve been trying to focus on cultivating better sleep hygiene because of my struggle with insomnia. I used to bring my phone to bed with me –– now I <del>don&#8217;t</del> <i>am getting better</i>.</p>
<p>The truth is, I’ve let myself get really lax about my screentime. I find myself <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/managing-social-media-intake-without-quitting/" target="_blank">compulsively reaching for my phone</a>, panicking when I can’t find it for 2 seconds, and then finding an instant sense of calm with the wash of the blue-lit screen. As I write this, I realize that it’s probably time to get back to being more vigilant….</p>
<h3>11:30 p.m.</h3>
<p>Shit! Still scrolling.</p>
<h3>12 p.m.</h3>
<p>Phone down, panic on, eyes closed. Tomorrow I’ll be better.</p>
<h2>Reflecting on the Social Life</h2>
<p>As you can see, making social media such a large part of your personal <i>and</i> professional lives requires balance. Occasional guilt for overindulging is okay, and reminds us that we recognize the need for limits. It’s also important we connect with people face-to-face to keep us grounded in reality.</p>
<p>If playing the “comparison game” on social media makes you unhappy, or you feel excessive social use is having an effect on your mental health, this may be a sign to seek assistance. Social media, like other addiction-prone activities, is often used as an escape from larger mental health issues that should be addressed. <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_POST_INLINE&amp;utr_adgroup=how-talkspaces-social-media-manager-battles-social-network-obsession-a-diary-entry?utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/social-media-obsession-how-talkspace-social-manager-battles" target="_blank">Talkspace therapists</a> have experience helping others through their unhealthy reliance on social media, and are there for you if you need help.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.ama.org/publications/MarketingNews/Pages/feeding-the-addiction.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Research shows</a> that social media use actually releases dopamine in the brain, just like food, sex, or drugs. It is no wonder that so many people feel that they are “addicted” to social media, and feel antsy or anxious when they try to stop checking Instagram, Facebook, or other sites for more than a few minutes. If you feel that social media is controlling you, instead of you controlling when you use it, then you may want to think about how to better integrate your social media use within your day-to-day life.</p>
<p><span id="more-10272"></span></p>
<h2><b>Understanding Your Social Media Habits</b></h2>
<p>If you find yourself thinking that you can’t cut down on social media use because social media comprises your entire social life, then it is important to explore the consequences of this assumption.</p>
<p>Many people, especially <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/10-signs-social-anxiety-according-therapist/" target="_blank">introverts</a>, find it easier and more convenient to scroll through some pictures and “like” them, instead of the hassle of going out and engaging with friends face to face. However, while this may in fact be easier in the short term, there can be harmful ramifications of choosing to socialize primarily over social media.</p>
<p>In the long term, social media interactions are far more superficial than having a face-to-face conversation with a friend. People generally only share the best things that happen to them on social media, and you may be missing out on what is really going on behind your friends’ carefully curated social media façade. You, yourself, also have a curated social media image, and over time, you may start to consider this as your actual self, which can mean that deeper parts of your personality don’t get as much play.</p>
<p>Additionally, social media can take you away from family members, hurt your work performance, and make you appear rude to friends (when you’re posting and liking instead of engaging when you do meet up in person). For all these reasons and more, moderating social media usage is probably a healthy goal.</p>
<h2><b>How to Balance Your Social Media Time</b></h2>
<p>However, as anyone who has tried dieting knows, any sort of restriction can be difficult to maintain. Telling yourself that you can’t do something only makes most of us crave it even more, and social media use is no exception. Instead of restricting the amount of time you allow yourself to use social media, why not take the opposite tack and increase your non-social-media related activities? This is a much healthier and more easily maintained way to moderate your use.</p>
<p>For example, try scheduling an <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/5-ways-exercise-is-great-for-your-mental-health/">exercise</a> class, asking a friend to come over, planning a date with your significant other. All of these are real-world activities that can greatly enrich your life, and make memories you wouldn’t have if you had spent the same amount of time scrolling through your Facebook feed. If you schedule activities so that you aren’t able to use social media, then you are getting even more of a jump on cracking your social media addiction.</p>
<p>Introspecting about what you like about social media can also, ironically, help you cut back on your use. If you think deeply about why you’re so obsessed with Instagram, for example, and it’s because you love seeing pictures of other people’s travels, then maybe you need to conclude that it’s time to save up for an exotic trip of your own. If you’re drawn to food photos, then maybe you can take a cooking class. If you check your exes compulsively on Facebook, it could be time to devote more of your time and energy to moving on and meeting new potential partners — online and offline.</p>
<p>If you are trying to meet certain needs through your social media use, then figuring out other ways to meet these same needs in healthier ways can be very enlightening.</p>
<h2><b>Regain Control Over Heavy Social Media Use</b></h2>
<p>Social media is not the enemy, but it can feel that way when you’ve recognize that it consumes far more of your waking hours than you’d like.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in specific ways social media affects our daily lives, we recommend reading the following pieces:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;<a href="http://pubx.co/cftOG7" target="_blank">How to Find Peace After Social Media Rocks Your Confidence</a>&#8221; originally appeared on Shine, a free daily text to help you thrive.</em></p>
<p>Jealousy. Ugh. Even typing that word brings up that uneasy, queasy feeling. In this age of <a href="https://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-trials-and-tribulations-of-social-media-envy/?utm_source=Shine&amp;utm_medium=Blog" target="_blank">social media</a> addiction, it’s near impossible not to feel jealous when you’re flipping through people’s highlight reels and not seeing any of the behind-the-scenes struggles.</p>
<p>I feel that <a href="https://advice.shinetext.com/articles/im-good-with-whatever-the-high-price-of-people-pleasing/?utm_source=Shine&amp;utm_medium=Blog" target="_blank">ping of jealousy</a> when I see someone I know book a legit role (I&#8217;m an actress), take a luxurious beach vacation fit for Beyoncé, or rocking a bod like Halle Berry. I’m all like “Hi! Can we swap lives? Or just bodies? Or even paychecks?” I start asking myself, “What the heck am I doing with my life!?” I start to feel so far behind—and my good ol’ friends Ms. Gratitude and Papa Positivity are nowhere to be found.<span id="more-8584"></span></p>
<p>It’s the worst when I feel pangs of jealousy towards the people I love. Of course I’m over the moon about their new house! They’ve worked hard, they deserve it. But I’d be lying if I wasn’t thinking, “Um, what about me?!”</p>
<p>So, what do I do with these not-so-hot feelings? Here are my favorite tactics to turn to:</p>
<h2>1. Do Not Shove It Down</h2>
<p>When I find myself feeling “jelly,” one of my go-to coping skills is to put words to my feelings—and share them if I can. <a href="https://advice.shinetext.com/articles/5-ways-to-build-your-emotional-resilience/?utm_source=Shine&amp;utm_medium=Blog" target="_blank">Be honest with yourself</a>—of course you’re 99% pumped for your sister about her promotion. But there is maybe 1% of you that is like, “Dang. I could use that.” Express what you’re feeling in a safe place to get it off your chest. There is nothing worse than pretending you aren’t jealous—this is not being authentic and, like any other toxic emotion, it can cause even more problems if you keep it to yourself. Trust that the people who have your back can support you.</p>
<h2>2. Have an Attitude of Gratitude</h2>
<p>I think a healthy dose of <a href="https://advice.shinetext.com/articles/5-easy-ways-to-make-gratitude-a-habit-you-ll-love-to-practice-forever/?utm_source=Shine&amp;utm_medium=Blog" target="_blank">gratitude</a> is just the right prescription for any icky feelings, especially jealousy. Getting into a state of gratitude immediately puts the focus on yourself and not what is happening with others. Let jealousy be your cue for a gratitude exercise. When it pops up, try to list 10 things you are grateful for in your life and why. Really let yourself have all the feels.</p>
<h2>3. No News Before Noon</h2>
<p>Any guru will tell you starting your day off with a phone or emails is about the best way to crash a positive morning before it even starts. I really make it a priority to meditate and set my intentions for the day before I even look at my phone. I also have suggested to my partner “No news before noon.” It started with trying to prevent a downward spiral from all the world’s troubles first thing out of bed. I think it’s really important to apply this to social media as well.</p>
<p>If you can start your day off fresh with some positive <a href="https://advice.shinetext.com/articles/5-ways-to-put-self-love-into-action/?utm_source=Shine&amp;utm_medium=Blog" target="_blank">self-love</a>—whether it’s meditating, affirmations, prayer or your a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shine-daily-motivation/id1293721589?mt=8" target="_blank">free Shine morning meditation</a> (wink wink)—it can make a huge difference. Even if I just stay off social media for the first five minutes of my day, I find I’m much less likely to get on the “hey what about me?” bus when I fire up the ‘gram. It’s setting myself up for success and to be in a less reactive state. In fact, if I’m in a good place, I sometimes find that seeing someone else crushing it can light a fire under my booty—then, I totally bypass the whole jealousy thing.</p>
<h2>4. Ask: What Do I Want?</h2>
<p>Even though I try to set myself up for success and avoid the comparison game show, sometimes it just happens. Let’s say I heard about someone booking a role that is younger than me who was practically handed a big break. I can’t pretend it doesn’t sting. If I’m still feeling those green envy feelings after talking to my posse, it’s time to really look at what’s going on inside. What is it I’m really jealous of? Do I really want a smoking hot Mercedes Benz? Or, is it the ease of life the Benz represents? Is it a real wanting? Everyone is a mirror—use this opportunity to see something you love or want manifested in another person, knowing it’s a bud inside of you waiting to bloom.</p>
<h2>5. Dig Deep</h2>
<p>If you want to go even further, allow yourself to get quiet. Then, ask yourself: What is blocking me from achieving that wanting? What is the limiting belief? Do I feel I’m not good enough? Not worthy? Not able to receive? Once you find the belief that hits you in the gut (and it will—let your intuition show you the way), how does this limiting belief make you feel? Writing it down helps. But most importantly, really feel it. Allow yourself to go there for 180 seconds. You have to feel the pain to heal it.</p>
<p>Then, flip it. If you’re limiting belief was “I’m not good enough” what is the exact opposite? “I am more than good enough!” What does this bring up for you? Write down all the feelings that come up and give your mindset space to shift. Then, start to think: What action can you take right now to start making the thing you want a reality? And really do it. Fully commit to living a life that is your biggest self.</p>
<h2>6. Know You&#8217;re Not Alone</h2>
<p>However you decide to deal with the feeling of jealousy, remind yourself that everyone has this experience. This is a very normal feeling. You are not a jerk friend for feeling envious of your best friend’s hot new partner. It happens to the best of us. Take a deep breathe. Remember, you are not alone. And know this: Someone is likely experiencing that same feeling of jealousy about something awesome in your beautiful life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago, Gale’s mother passed away after a grueling battle with cancer. As the lone Atheist in a devout religious family, Gale felt isolated and unable to grieve in the way she wanted. The inundation of spiritual rhetoric from relatives made it difficult for her to celebrate her mother’s life.</p>
<p>To find a place where she could speak freely, Gale searched for support groups for secular people who wanted to grieve without any pressure to pray or consider religious concepts like God and the afterlife. She found two secular grief groups on Facebook and has been satisfied with the online community.</p>
<p>“I would still feel almost entirely alone if it were not for these people,” Gale said of her community members. “I feel heard and understood, and it&#8217;s not less real to me if that understanding and camaraderie happens online.”<span id="more-6586"></span></p>
<p>Since Facebook became ubiquitous during the mid to late 2000s, millions of people like Gale have wondered what to do online when a loved one passes away. Most of the people we know have Facebook accounts at the very least, so what happens to their pages when they are gone? How should we interact with their digital ghosts on social media?</p>
<p>When the practice of grieving via social media and other online mediums emerged, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/07/death-facebook-dead-profiles_n_2245397.html" target="_blank">some people were uncomfortable with the idea</a>. As an increasing number of people engaged with social media profiles of dead loved ones, however, grieving online became too common to be strange.</p>
<p>“Someone I knew died by suicide in 2010, and I remember how weird it felt that his Facebook page stayed active (due to his parents), and that people would still post on it about how they missed him, happy memories and old photos,” said <a href="https://www.christianlowery.com/" target="_blank">social media manager Chris Lowery</a>. “Fast forward seven years, and I believe it is now the norm that a deceased person’s FB page stay active as a way to remember them.”</p>
<p>To address the issue of users passing away before taking down their public pages, the Facebook team created the option of having <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1506822589577997/" target="_blank">memorialized accounts</a>. Facebook users can now select a “legacy contact” to manage the account after they die. When people create a will, they often work with a lawyer to decide what will happen to a “digital legacy” that can include social media.</p>
<h2>Current Trends and Sentiments on Expressing Grief Via Social Media</h2>
<p>Today most people perceive the social media profiles and pages of the deceased as memorials, regardless of whether they are officially part of a digital legacy. The vast majority of the population believes being able to view a loved one’s profile after their death is important, according to a <a href="https://digitallegacyassociation.org/the-digital-assets-and-digital-legacy-infographic-2016/" target="_blank">2016 survey</a> by the Digital Legacy Association. Roughly half of survey respondents either wanted their social media to remain active after death or wouldn’t mind if friends and family members kept their profiles up. Only a small fraction of respondents found the experience of viewing a profile of a deceased love one to be “upsetting and not of value.”</p>
<p>Because of the wide acceptance and encouragement of grieving via social media, the practice has evolved and expanded beyond Facebook. Twitter has also become a popular place to honor the dead. When a beloved celebrity dies, their name usually becomes the top hashtag and keyword on Twitter for at least a day. Fans, journalists, and personal acquaintances send 140-character (or less) expressions of their grief into a public forum where anyone can respond. This open environment is different from personal Facebook posts where most people who view the messages of mourning have a closer connection to the person who passed away.</p>
<p>Sometimes people express grief on Twitter as part of activism or connection to a community, race, or other identity. The black community on Twitter, also known as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/04/the-truth-about-black-twitter/390120/" target="_blank">Black Twitter</a>, occasionally grabs a high-ranking hashtag by acknowledging the anniversary of the death of someone like Mike Brown, a victim of racism and police violence.</p>
<p>It has become standard to grieve on all major social media platforms, including Instagram and Pinterest. For example, people have made Pinterest boards celebrating the lives of their dead loved ones.</p>
<p>Using social media to spread the news of someone’s passing and honor their life has not completely replaced traditional mediums like obituaries, letters, and phone calls. Nonetheless, it is much more common for people to post messages about their deceased love ones on Facebook than it is for them to mail a card to surviving family members.</p>
<h2>Changing What It Means to Grieve</h2>
<p>Social media has empowered millions of people to adopt a broader mindset regarding grieving. Traditionally, grieving referred specifically to the bereavement period after a loved one passed away. Today people express grief on social media in response to many types of losses: getting laid off, leaving their home as part of a move, ending a relationship, a pet dying, and more.</p>
<p>“A close friend of mine has a newborn son with several health problems, and she has used Facebook and Instagram as a way to grieve for her son’s health and life expectancy,” Lowery said. “She posts updates from his doctor visits and often gets hundreds of comments from friends and family that her son has inspired them and that they&#8217;re praying for her.”</p>
<p>These behaviors actually align with the original definition of grief that did not mention death specifically. Grief means “keen mental suffering or distress over affliction or loss; sharp sorrow; painful regret.” A “loss” can be both literal and figurative.</p>
<p>Some people stretch the concept of grief by posting feelings of sadness about changes in the world, but doing so in a manner that resembles grieving a loss. After the 2016 election, for example, millions of Americans grieved on social media because they felt like the country they knew and loved was gone.</p>
<h2>The Pros and Cons of Grieving On Social Media</h2>
<p>Grieving on social media has generally had a positive effect on mental health. In the case of bereavement, the practice allows people to — in a sense — “reach” their departed loved ones, according to Kaddie Fancher, the social media manager at the <a href="http://empirexo.com/" target="_blank">Empire PR Agency</a>.</p>
<p>“I find this not only to be useful, but somewhat therapeutic,” Fancher said.</p>
<p>Social media can help people reach sources of support, express their feelings, and find closure during the worst of their pain. It is also a practical tool for organizing funerals, informing people of the death of the loved one, and connecting people who knew the deceased but not each other.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, social media can also be triggering for people who are in the throes of grief. Imagine a woman who recently had a miscarriage. Drowning in sadness and unable to focus on much of anything, she lies in bed with her phone and scrolls through Instagram. Immediately she sees an image of her friend’s beautiful newborn child. The post has hundreds of likes and dozens of comments full of well wishes and compliments. What she thought would be a welcome distraction from the loss has now intensified her anguish.</p>
<p>Grieving on public platforms also runs the risk of encountering trolls and other insensitive people who want to disparage the dearly departed. There are also those who use memorial content to bring attention to themselves or start a heated argument regarding issues related to the deceased. This problem is especially common on Twitter.</p>
<p>Whether it is losing a dog and stumbling upon pictures of puppies or being the victim of a troll on a memorial page, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram can be risky places to grieve. Like with any use of social media, people need to be cautious to prevent the experience from negatively affecting their mental health.</p>
<p>If you are grieving and planning on using social media, consider modifying your settings first. By temporarily hiding certain accounts or people from your feeds, there will be a lower chance of encountering posts that might be upsetting. Taking a break from social media might help, too.</p>
<p>As social media evolves, we will most likely see people grieve in many more ways. The more methods people have for coping with grief, the easier it will be for them to process the many emotions that come with such a complicated and grueling process.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve heard from clients, &#8220;Other mom&#8217;s don&#8217;t seem to have this problem.&#8221; This statement could be about depression, anxiety, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/06/how-to-handle-a-panic-attack-at-work-the-complete-guide/" target="_blank">panic</a>, marital issues, kid issues, trouble balancing or a myriad of other topics. When I ask why they think no one else struggles, social media is inevitably part of the answer.<span id="more-4565"></span></p>
<p>Social media tells moms no one else struggles. No one else has a really ugly Tuesday afternoon with kids crying, messy living rooms and break downs in the bathroom. It&#8217;s only you.</p>
<p>You log into Facebook and you see everyone’s picture perfect world. You feel alone in your perception.</p>
<p>Facebook and social media is more of a &#8220;fakebook.&#8221; People present the best version of their reality rather than what daily life actually looks like.</p>
<p>Many mothers experience a &#8220;Pinterest stress.&#8221; They feel they can&#8217;t compete with the picture perfect lives they see online of other mothers. Through social media you can quickly feel inadequate.</p>
<p>Keep reading to learn how to deal with these feelings!</p>
<h2>Own Your Decisions!</h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-4567 alignright" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/mom-daughter-birthday-secondary_300W_JR.jpg" alt="mom daughter birthday balloons" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/mom-daughter-birthday-secondary_300W_JR.jpg 300w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/mom-daughter-birthday-secondary_300W_JR-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>When I was thinking about planning my daughter&#8217;s one-year birthday party, people asked me what kind of party I was going to have. I had not thought about that.</p>
<p>I soon became aware of the vast and wild world of a first birthday. I came in contact with multiple moms who talked about the pressure of holding a &#8220;perfect&#8221; first birthday for their child.</p>
<p>I started to wonder, “Perfect for who?” Stress can consume an event like this. It has to look a certain way. It has to be held in a certain place.</p>
<p>Where did we get these ideas? Social media of course! You’ve most likely experienced this a million times. You saw an idea on someone else&#8217;s Instagram and now you HAVE to do it.</p>
<p>And if you want to do that. Go for it. Own it. And if you don&#8217;t want to do it. Don&#8217;t go for it. And own that.</p>
<p>Don’t let social media dictate what you decide. If crafting and planning is your thing, be proud of it. Have fun with it. If it&#8217;s not your thing, you can be proud of that too. Do something that fits for you.</p>
<p>Social media doesn’t get to tell you what fits. You decide.</p>
<h2>Have Some Healthy Skepticism</h2>
<p>No one&#8217;s life is perfect, no matter how it looks on social media. We all have struggles. We all have bad days. Know that when you look at someone&#8217;s life online, it only tells a piece of the story. If you aren&#8217;t able to keep that perspective, it might be time for a social media break.</p>
<h2>Take a Social Media Break</h2>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-4568 alignright" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/social-media-break-secondary_300W_JR.jpg" alt="Facebook app smartphone red x" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>If you are becoming anxious, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depressed</a> and struggling with constant comparison to the online lives you see, it’s time for a social media break. Even if you aren’t struggling with these issues, taking a break from social media is not a bad idea.</p>
<p>Delete the apps from your phone and carry around a book or magazine with you instead. You will be amazed at how much time you save by not checking social media. There might be some surprising habits you have of instinctively checking your phone for updates or automatically going on Facebook whenever you open a computer.</p>
<p>If you find yourself on automatic pilot trying to check your social media profile, you know you’ve taken a break for a good reason. Taking a break helps you gain perspective. You make real connections with the people around you. Your life becomes your own instead of what you want your online friends to think it is.</p>
<p>The people I have worked with who have taken a break have come out feeling refreshed, spending their time more mindfully and enjoying life more. If and when they do get back on social media, they know to limit their time on it and work on living their own life.</p>
<h2>Be Real With Someone</h2>
<p>A lot of moms have shared their struggles, their beautiful mess of a life. That sharing can be so powerful and help others see they are not alone.</p>
<p>It does not, however, replace the sharing that happens in conversations. If you are struggling with comparison, talk to someone about it. Chances are they feel or have felt the same way.</p>
<p>If you are struggling with this so much you are feeling anxious or depressed, this is the time to <a href="http://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?_ga=1.66412206.1676465323.1458915616" target="_blank">talk to a therapist</a>. He or she can help you reclaim your life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">16-year-old Lilli Hymowitz has lots of money and more than 20,000 followers on Instagram but struggles to live a happy life. Like many teenage girls, she deals with drama from boys and friends, divorced parents, and trying to find meaning in her life outside of the parties and selfies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a series of interviews with a reporter from </span><a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/09/lilli-hymowitz-prom-queen-of-instagram.html?mid=twitter_nymag#" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Magazine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Hymowitz admitted she used Instagram to project something that didn’t match her self-image. The piece portrayed her as an embodiment of how social media creates alternate realities that can make us look more negatively at our actual realities.</span><span id="more-2972"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, according to many studies, can increase feelings of loneliness, envy, resentment, narcissism, dependency and depression. Here are a few we studies have curated:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a University of Maryland</span><a href="https://theworldunplugged.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of close to 1,000 students globally, participants struggled to go 24 hours without using social media</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media can cause </span><a href="http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cyber.2013.0305" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">distorted body image</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media can exacerbate personality disorders such as </span><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201306/do-facebook-and-other-social-media-encourage-narcissism" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">narcissistic personality disorder</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unhealthy Facebook use </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eat.22254/abstract" target="_blank">associated with eating disorders</a></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of these effects, stories like Hymowitz’s have become common. Actually, hers is tame compared to some.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Writer Alyssa Coscarelli admitted </span><a href="http://www.refinery29.com/instagram-hate-like" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram enabled unhealthy behaviors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> such as researching her boyfriend’s exes, procrastinating, obsessing over self-image and impulse buying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not an image-obsessed jerk at heart, but Instagram just about turns me into one,” she wrote.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we browse or post on social media, we are indulging in a distorted or incomplete reflection of our lives. People can post photos and comments without editing them, but #nofilter does not exist on social media.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe it’s time we think about using social media in a healthier way. </span></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=5&amp;v=NsLfu4Sk00U" target="_blank">New Yorkers and tourists encountered a massive mirror wall</a> in Flatiron Plaza. It was 30 feet long, three feet wide, seven feet tall, and ridiculously conspicuous. The west and east sides produced distorted reflections similar to those in a hall of mirrors and featured text such as this:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=5&amp;v=NsLfu4Sk00U" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2922 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/social-media-event-screenshot-redo1_JR.jpg" alt="Talkspace social media event mirror wall" width="222" height="275" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The north and south sides allowed pedestrians to see an accurate reflection:</span><span id="more-2910"></span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2924 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/social-media-event-screenshot-redo2_JR.jpg" alt="social media reflection Talkspace event" width="275" height="275" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/social-media-event-screenshot-redo2_JR.jpg 275w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/social-media-event-screenshot-redo2_JR-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people continued their commutes or took more pictures of the Flatiron Building while others approached our staff to ask what in the world was going on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The distorted reflections in the mirror symbolized how social media degrades our self image and exacerbates mental health issues. It warned against excessive or unhealthy use of social media by citing relevant research. Hundreds of people stopped to interact with the mirror and many shared their experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One woman recounted how she suffered from depression that led to anorexia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Social media is one of my triggers,” she said. “I think what you guys are doing is really great.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mother told her story as well; her daughter was depressed, struggled with weight issues and used social media to maintain her warped self image. The response was overwhelmingly positive because it seems New Yorkers have long suspected social media could be bad for their mental health. The stories were heartbreaking, but seeing our campaign galvanize people to work on their social media use or try our new </span><a href="http://talkspace.com/online-therapy/social-media-dependency-therapy/?fv=social" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Media Dependency Therapy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made the event hopeful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most memorable visitors was a denim-clad former Miss West Virginia who used her influence to help girls improve their self-esteem. A band featuring a Slash look-alike joined us as well, playing over the siren of a crew filming a car chase in the new “Ghostbusters” movie. It’s New York — what else would happen?   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After two days, we had to remove the mirror. The impact, however, was not so easy to tear down. The conversation continued online where users healthily engaged in social media using the #ReflectReality hashtag. We handed out fliers with activities to help people with social media dependency and stayed in touch with those who were interested.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2917 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/social-media-event-screenshot3_275H_JR.jpg" alt="flier for talkspace social media event" width="215" height="275" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Check the news, blogs and yes, social media, and you can see people everywhere talking about how we are harming ourselves with social media. The medium presents a paradox &#8212; it connects us with the world while making us feel lonely, depressed and isolated.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We acknowledge this but are too dependent to break the cycle of compare, despair, like and share.</span></p>
<p><b><i> “I need to get my mind off of this.”</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of my Talkspace clients, Ashley</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, texts me around midnight on Friday.</span><span id="more-2897"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I hit the gym and then went out for a drink with friends after work. I tried to stay busy and I even called my mom, but I broke down. I just couldn’t stand it anymore. Of course, the minute I saw his Facebook, I regretted it. Augh! Why do I keep doing this to myself?! It’s over, I know it is over. What do I care what he is up to? Naturally, he checked in at the bar where </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">she</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> works. One of his friends made a comment about giving a good ‘tip’ to the service there. This is so humiliating. We just broke up a couple of weeks ago. I need to get my mind off of this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ask her what she did after she saw the Facebook post.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was agitated after that and couldn’t take it. I checked his insta, twitter, tumblr…Just when I thought I had eased down to just Facebook checking. But this totally triggered me and it set me off. I didn’t feel in control. On his insta, I saw a black and white photo of her in a sea of sheets… his sheets. He had deleted all the photos of me. Even the last weekend trip we took last month. To make matters worse, she looked hot and all of his bros left comments and liked. Someone posted, ‘Ashley who?’ I feel like he never cared for me at all. I feel like it was so easy for him to make it where I don’t even exist anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ashley’s pain and distress touches me. A breakup is hard under any circumstances, but to navigate letting go and moving forward when you are still connected over social media takes an enormous amount of strength. It is easy to tell someone, “just block him” or “don’t click.” Actually, it is too easy and cruel. Anyone who has had to struggle with similar circumstances realizes it isn’t that simple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humans thrive on consistent behavior and social media platforms are designed for habitual checking. When you add the stress of a breakup, it is like you are throwing gasoline on a fire. It’s more than sadness. Ashley needed understanding because she was suffering with Social Media Dysphoria.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Social Media Dysphoria Explained</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Media Dysphoria is the term mental health professionals use to describe people who experience troubling symptoms associated with use of social media. Growing evidence suggests social media use is contributing to a myriad of mental health concerns. There are biological, environmental and emotional reasons why people find it so hard to pull away from social media use when they feel harmful effects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The word dysphoria comes from Greek origins meaning, “difficult to bear.” It is a profound state of unease and dissatisfaction and has certain characteristics of mood that accompany it. These can include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irritability, increased anger or feeling “on edge”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guilty ruminations, obsessive thinking</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anxiety</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low or depressed mood</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sleep difficulties</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Racing thoughts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feelings of indifference</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confusion</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling out of control or overwhelmed with emotion</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Difficulty concentrating</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feelings of loneliness and isolation</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you think you struggle with any of these symptoms, there are steps you can take to feel better. Trying to ignore or wait out your concerns is not a good idea. When we ignore what is troubling us, it often gets worse. Talking with a therapist and finding ways to interact with social media in an empowering way can help.</span></p>
<p><b><i>When sharing is real</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many months after the Instagram discovery, Ashley said something to me that spoke to how much social media impacted and distorted what was happening in her past relationships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought that type of sharing was an extension of our relationship, that posting those photos to everyone was a declaration of his love for me; that those likes meant love in some way,” she said. “I now understand his idea of sharing was not the same as mine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through our conversations, Ashley was able to look at her ex’s social media behavior objectively. She was becoming more aware and taking time to heal and discover what she wanted moving forward. She was opening up, sharing her truth and expecting a more genuine type of sharing from others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need to move beyond identifying the problems people are having with social media and take action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The therapists at Talkspace created a Social Media Dysphoria Task Force after many of our clients came to us with a social media element hindering their well-being. We have been examining the latest research, sharing ideas and adapting tried and true interventions that are helping people.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force recently launched <a title="Social Media Dependency Therapy" href="http://talkspace.com/online-therapy/social-media-dependency-therapy/?fv=social" target="_blank">Social Media Dependency Therapy</a>, a 12-week program to help people overcome the mental health issues social media causes or exacerbates. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By developing an authentic online relationship with a licensed therapist on the Talkspace platform, a person can regain control over their dependence on social media and share in authentic ways that are meaningful to them. </span></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media has transformed our culture into one of over-sharing. As we spend more and more time online, it is important we look at how this may affect our mental health.</p>
<h2>#NoFilter? Not Really: The False Reality of Social Media</h2>
<p>Through Facebook posts, tweets and Instagram photos, we peep a snippet of someone’s edited life. Sometimes we find ourselves judging our own lives with these updates, tweets and photos. The comparisons we make to our realities are unfair, because these snippets are a #filtered perspective of someone else’s life. There is no such thing as #nofilter. The comparisons we make can cause feelings of inferiority that lead to low self-esteem.<span id="more-2887"></span></p>
<h2>How Social Media Affects Mental Health: Research and Studies</h2>
<p>Low self-esteem is not the sole adverse side effect of intensive social media use. There have been significant links between our online presence and other aspects of our mental health. These connections have inspired the subject matter of many research studies around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Depression</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3907111/">correlation between social media use and depression</a> exists, although most researchers acknowledge the relationship is complex.</li>
<li>A <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150203123415.htm">study</a> by the University of Missouri-Columbia suggests Facebook users who experience envy could develop symptoms of depression.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.editlib.org/p/69381/">Increasing amounts of Facebook use</a> among first-year college students have been associated with higher levels of loneliness.</li>
<li>According to a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4162355/">research study</a> published in Frontiers of Human Neuroscience, people who self-report using more social media have higher self-reports of depression.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Body Dysmorphia</strong></p>
<p>Another area of concern is body image. Body dysmorphia &#8212; also known as body dysmorphic disorder &#8212; is “a preoccupation with what they imagine to be a defective body part or a distorted view of some small and insignificant defect.”</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/health-26952394">Research</a> suggests increased amounts of time on Facebook may lead to body image insecurity. They further suggest that our comparisons to our friends’ photos are more influential than photos of celebrities.</li>
<li>A <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eat.22254/abstract">study</a> in The International Journal of Eating Disorders<em> </em>showed Social Media exposure can promote distorted body image perception. Increased use of Facebook has additionally been associated with higher rates of disordered eating.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even with the above studies providing insights, it’s clear the relationship between our social media habits and mental health is complex. The impact our online habits have on mental health is specific to the individual, which can complicate potential challenges. As social media occupies an ever-increasing footprint in both our world and daily lives, it is critical we learn more about the long-term effects on our mental health.</p>
<h2>How Should We Deal with Social Media?</h2>
<p>If you feel you might have developed some negative feelings through social media use, there is hope! Our team of therapists at <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/" target="_blank">Talkspace</a> has reviewed the research on the effects of social media use on mental health. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/social-media-dependency-therapy/" target="_blank">Social Media Dependency Therapy</a> specializes in these concerns. Talkspace has developed this program for Talkspace users to reflect on how social media affects our well being and distorts our self image. The ultimate goal is reducing the negative emotions and compulsive behaviors surrounding its use.</p>
