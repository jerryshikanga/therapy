				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this series we look at a day in the lives of Talkspace therapists. Their stories illustrate the joys and challenges of dedicating one’s life to helping others improve their mental health, and cope with mental illness. Today&#8217;s featured Talkspace therapist is Melissa Moreno.</p>
<p><span id="more-9386"></span></p>
<h2>5:45 a.m.</h2>
<p>Morning comes so quickly! I am usually pretty motivated in the beginning of the week, but by Friday I may be hitting the snooze button and rolling out of bed by 6:00 a.m. Nonetheless, I wake up most days without an alarm clock.</p>
<p>Sometimes, before even getting out of the bed, I start my morning with a few minutes of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/good-mental-health-12-therapist-approved-tips/" target="_blank">mindfulness, gratitude, and breathing exercises</a>. I then go on Talkspace to begin answering my clients. From there, I go on Slack to post on the assigned channel and fulfill my duties as a Crisis Intervention Expert.</p>
<h2>6:45 a.m.</h2>
<p>Time to start the mom routine. These next 45 minutes seems like the busiest of my day. It’s a lot to juggle so many tasks in a short amount of time, all while trying to help my son get a good start to his day. I wake my son up for school and make breakfast. During this time I attend to my own self-care needs and get ready to leave for work, always making sure to feed the dog, fish, and turtle before I leave. Some days get harder, so on Thursday or Friday we sometimes pick up breakfast on the way to school.</p>
<h2>7:30 a.m.</h2>
<p>I order my On-The-Go Dunkin Donuts coffee. My morning coffee is part of my self-care plan and a daily treat. Then I head out the door to drop my son off to school and go to work.</p>
<h2>9 a.m.–5 p.m.</h2>
<p>I work full time (Monday – Friday) as a Facility Director at a non-secure program for adolescent boys. <a href="http://thesanctuaryinstitute.org/about-us/the-sanctuary-model" target="_blank">Sanctuary</a> is the treatment model for the program’s milieu, with an individual therapeutic treatment model focus of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2963469/" target="_blank">Dialectical Behavioral Therapy</a> (DBT]). Typically used for treating women with borderline personality disorder, the approach can also be effective for trauma and a range of related issues.</p>
<p>My day consists of providing clinical supervision, overseeing program compliance, crisis intervention, and behavior/ program modification. I spend a lot of time attending trainings about Sanctuary and DBT. When I started, I was not familiar with DBT but have since learned so much and have seen first-hand the benefits to these interventions with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/childrens-mental-health-worry-take-action/" target="_blank">adolescents and young adults suffering from significant trauma, PTSD, substance abuse, and personality disorders</a>. I have been able to apply these treatment interventions first hand and also learn how to provide clinical supervision through the lenses of Sanctuary (parallel process, vicarious trauma, safety plans) and DBT (behavior analysis, crisis intervention).</p>
<p>I love working with adolescents and find them naturally so hopeful. Despite facing many struggles in life, they still have so much ahead of them and the opportunity to improve. Prior to working with adolescents, I worked in corrections as a forensic social worker, so I have a lot of experience with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/really-means-psychopath-sociopath-narcissist/" target="_blank">conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder</a> clients.</p>
<p>Sometimes I find it easier to sneak in some me time during my 9-5 schedule, so I usually leave work early twice a month on Friday afternoons for a game of golf, time with friends, or a nail or hair appointment. It’s also a nice time for a break before I get into my evening routine.</p>
<h2>5:30 p.m.</h2>
<p>I check in on Talkspace and messaging clients. Then I post on my assigned Slack channel or answer Talkspace therapists.</p>
<h2>6:00 p.m.</h2>
<p>Time to work out! <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/5-ways-exercise-is-great-for-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">I go to the gym 2-3 days a week</a>, sometimes working with my personal trainer. This activity is great stress relief and a time to plan out any things for the evening that I need to get done. Organization is key to my life! With so many responsibilities to juggle, I find it important to stay organized.</p>
<h2>7:00 p.m.</h2>
<p>Mom routine – round two! Evenings mean time for: dinner, sports practice, homework, making lunch for the following day, packing bags for the mornings, and feeding my dog (who thinks she should eat whenever anyone is in the kitchen). I usually have my second wind by this point. Because there is so much to get done, I keep myself pretty focused on all I have to complete.</p>
<h2>8:00 p.m.</h2>
<p>I try to do at least one household task a day (clean the bathroom, vacuum, do laundry, change the sheets). This way I can keep up on the household tasks and leave bigger projects for the weekend. I find that a little bit everyday helps me manage things, and I don’t feel as overwhelmed.</p>
<h2>8:30 p.m.</h2>
<p>I check in on Talkspace messaging clients or live video sessions. As usual, I go on Slack and post to my assigned channel or answer Talkspace therapists. I spend about 15-20 minutes during this time to catch up on paperwork for my private practice clients. This is always done in the comfort of my PJ’s, which is one things I love about Talkspace.</p>
<h2>10:00 p.m.</h2>
<p>Me time! This is the time I catch up on my favorite TV shows, read, have a glass of wine, or some nights simply fall asleep. I am lucky to say that I have no <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/sleeping-with-anxiety/" target="_blank">problem sleeping</a>. When my head hits the pillow, I am out. Sleep is also key to helping me maintain my tasks during the day and allows me to wake up refreshed, ready to do it all again.</p>
<p>My life is definitely busy and I love it. It amazes me how much I can really accomplish, and how I can help improve many people’s quality of life by being personally focused, organized, and taking care of myself. I work well in fast-paced, crisis environments and use those same skills to manage a multitude of personal and professional projects, finding motivation and drive by doing more.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone knows difficult people — whether at work, at home, maybe even in your friend group. While people can be difficult for a variety of reasons, most people we’d identify as “difficult” share something in common: they are hard to interact with. Perhaps they are fixated on being right, always pointing out others’ flaws. They may make social situations tense by being quick to criticize or make fun of others, whether openly or passive-aggressively. They may explode when they are challenged, or have volatile mood swings. Often, others feel like they have to walk on eggshells around them.</p>
<p><span id="more-8866"></span></p>
<p>Particularly for those who are sensitive, dealing with difficult people can be extremely stressful. The burden can grow to the point that it severely impacts overall quality of life. But there are ways to cope with these people so you can feel more in control of your interactions. It is essential to have a game plan for coping with people who trigger you, and it can include many of these points.</p>
<h2>Don’t Share Things You Feel Insecure About</h2>
<p>This is harder with difficult family members than with difficult coworkers, but it is doable. Before sharing any private thoughts or intimate feelings with a challenging person, think about how you’ll feel if they minimize or dismiss your concerns.</p>
<p>Instead, what if you stuck to light topics of conversation? Discuss TV shows, the book you’re reading, straightforward things at work.Many people find this strategy helpful, as it shifts inevitable negativity away from topics that are sensitive or personal.</p>
<h2>Deflect the Conversation Away from Yourself</h2>
<p>Many difficult people are <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/tag/narcissism/" target="_blank">narcissists</a>, and enjoy nothing more than regaling you, and whoever else will listen, with an endless stream of anecdotes and stories about their own trials and tribulations. If you find that getting along with a difficult person is necessary in your life — because they are your boss or your friend’s partner, for instance — try focusing the conversation on them, rather than opening up. This way, you can avoid any confrontation, but still avoid opening yourself up to their criticisms, mood swings, or any other difficult behaviors.</p>
<h2>Flex Your Empathy Muscles</h2>
<p>Most difficult people are the way they are because of strenuous circumstances in their upbringing or later lives. Empathy is crucial when you’re interacting with a difficult person who has a significant impact on your life, like a relative. You don’t need to spend a lot of time thinking about how your coworker may have been treated as a child (although it would still help your perspective taking ability). With a close family member, however, this type of larger perspective may make the difference between bitterly resenting someone and being able to tolerate them.</p>
<h2>Make Self-Care a First Priority</h2>
<p>If you know you’re going to be around your hypercritical father-in-law, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/7-self-care-tips-for-when-stress-affects-your-body/" target="_blank">take some time for yourself</a> before and after the interaction. You may even plan to reward yourself if you’re able to take the higher ground with him. An hour of listening to him spout nonsense about politics could mean you treat yourself to a massage later in the week. Take some deep breaths, drink your favorite beverage, go to the gym. Whatever gives you peace of mind, make sure to set aside time for it.</p>
<h2>Don’t Take Things Personally</h2>
<p>This is the most important (and the hardest) aspect of dealing with difficult people. It is integral to recognize that difficult people are difficult by nature, and with everyone. This doesn’t have to do with you.</p>
<p>Yes, some individuals can hide the difficult parts of their personalities with those they don’t interact with often, but immediate family tends to bear the brunt of difficult people’s burdensome behavior. It can be transformative to realize that a difficult person is that way because of their own history and personality, and that your behavior plays a much smaller role in how they respond to you than you might think.</p>
<p>If you struggle with a difficult person in your daily life, keep these techniques in mind and you will likely be less anxious in their presence. Of course, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/10/5-qualities-will-help-get-therapy/" target="_blank">working with a therapist</a> on tactics for your unique situation may also be very useful. You may not be able to control anyone else’s behavior, but you can control how you respond to them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In this series we look at a day in the lives of our therapists. Their stories illustrate the joys and challenges of dedicating one’s life to helping others improve their mental health and cope with mental illness.</em></p>
<p><strong>7:30 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>I awaken to a chorus of birds chirping, singing riotously, endlessly. The windows are closed and we don’t have any pet birds, but for the first minute or so I believe I am hearing the lovely music of birds in the treetops. Eventually I remember that it’s the ringtone of my iPhone, and I roll over and hit “Snooze.” This happens a few more times until I’m ready to put my feet on the floor, sit up on the bed, and admire the view through the wall-to-wall window of palm trees and sky.</p>
<p><strong>8:30 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Returned from my morning walk, I park my specialized orthopedic walker in the dining alcove. I’ve been using it as a mobility aid for about six years now, since my arthritis, fibromyalgia, and COPD overtook me and I became disabled. Like the commercial says, I love my walker. I named it Dolly. Without it, I’d be unable to walk more than thirty yards. With it, I can go almost anywhere!<span id="more-8539"></span></p>
<p><strong>9:00 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>After a breakfast of coffee, yogurt, and granola, I open my “office” to see who is in the “waiting room.” I used to grab a briefcase and drive to my brick-and-mortar office in time to greet my first client of the day, but now my office is my computer. I hold it on my lap, on the rose- and celadon-cushioned love seat in the living room, facing outward past the lanai, to the treetops. I feel like I am in a treehouse! I’ll spend a lot of time here, today, because it’s my favorite spot – for working, reading, knitting, phoning, and even meditating. In a little while I’ll probably pick up my laptop “office” and carry it outdoors to the lanai, and work there for awhile. The weather may be cold back home in New England, but here in Florida it’s sunny, warm, and balmy.</p>
<p><strong>10:00 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>The waiting room (Talkspace screen) was packed this morning, and I’m barely halfway through my morning rounds. By “packed” I mean that quite a few clients were waiting to hear from me. I read what each one has texted me, carefully consider my response, type it into my reply, and hit “Send.” I could use the voice feature on my iPhone, but I prefer the larger screen and the keyboard of my laptop. I taught myself to type when I was eleven years old, and my parents gave me my birthday wish: an old, used upright typewriter with a yellowed booklet titled, “Teach Yourself Touch Typing.”</p>
<p>I love this work I do. All my life, I’ve wanted to help people find their way out of unhappiness. I read books about girls and women who were accomplished in the arts of healing, educating, and communicating. I started writing poetry when I was seven. I also wanted to be a doctor, to heal and comfort and inform people. I didn’t know there was a field called “psychotherapy.” If I had known about it, it’s what I would have aimed for at the start, rather than as a midlife career change.</p>
<p>I learned about psychotherapy when my world fell apart and I needed to be held up. Friends and family could help only so much. I needed someone who could stand to let me cry, listen to my anger and despair, and provide some perspective on reality. Therapy saved my life.</p>
<p><strong>12:00 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>I have “seen” all my morning clients. Now I have a few hours to spend any way I choose. I fix myself a little lunch (I eat very healthy – mostly paleo, at this point, with some Mediterranean diet influence) and then take a short nap. Because of the fibromyalgia, I tire easily and need to refresh my mind and my body with some magically restorative sleep. After that, I’ll either practice playing my harp or go downstairs to the lobby of the residential retirement community to check out the activities underway (and possibly join one). Or I’ll read from one of the books stacked on the end table or on the home screen of my Kindle. Or I might paint. I’m learning to work with acrylic, and I have a pad of blank art canvas waiting for me.</p>
<p><strong>3:00 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>I have a video appointment with a client I’m treating online. I settle on the couch and dial her up. For this, I use my iPhone, which I prop up against the cover of my opened Macbook. I’m a dedicated Apple user, and I bought an iPhone 6+ shortly after they became available. My husband had suggested that I save money by getting the standard-sized iPhone 6, but I was determined to get the wider screen of the Plus version. For the next half-hour my client mostly talks and I listen.</p>
<p>Because so much information about the client is visual, I love using video! I can see the bags under her eyes that tell me she’s tired, and I can see the frown that shows she’s unhappy, or at least grumpy. Sometimes I interrupt her with a question. Her eyes and hands reveal, by their movements, that certain topics agitate or enliven her. This is all very valuable information for me, as her therapist, so that I can be of maximum help to her. We do well texting, too, but the therapy moves a bit faster using video, and this client has a lot to work through.</p>
<p><strong>3:30 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>I make my afternoon rounds, checking my Talkspace page to see who is waiting to hear from me. I repeat the process of earlier in the day, considering each client’s remarks and my own response to them, and choosing the words I think will help most.</p>
<p>I saw a psychic/astrologer/past-life regressionist, once, who told me that in my previous lives I had been a writer, but of other people’s words — that is to say, a scribe. And that the purpose of my current life is to use my inborn skill with words to help others heal.</p>
<p>“By the way,” she asked, “What do you do for a living?”</p>
<p>When I told her I’m a psychotherapist, her eyes widened and she said, “You’re doing exactly what you’re supposed to do!”</p>
<p>“I know,” I said.</p>
<p>Doing what I was born to do — what feels so natural to me, that satisfies my drive to be helpful to others — is a gift from life. I think I am one of the luckiest people in the world, with one of the best jobs!</p>
<p>My husband has one of the best jobs, too. He’s a professional musician. While I work in my enchanting tree house office, he is often off playing in a band somewhere in town (as he is today), or closeted in the extra bedroom we allocated as his studio, practicing. We’re both old enough to retire but love our work too much to give it up. So we have found ways to keep working, but at a pace we can maintain. Four hours a day is fine for me. Four gigs a week is fine for him.</p>
<p><strong>5:00 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Dinner is a huge social event in this retirement community. People dress up every night and mill about outside the dining room when it’s about to open. I call this nightly gathering “the Senior Prom” because all these seniors are there to meet their “date” for dinner, or get a date with whom to dine. It’s very friendly and lovely to be part of!</p>
<p>Some of us are “going steady” with groups we dine with regularly and exclusively. My husband and I have steady dates four evenings a week (a different group each evening), and on the other three nights we go stag. Tonight is a stag night, and we’ve accepted an invitation from a group we’ve dined with a few times before and have enjoyed being with. This practice has helped us to meet almost everyone who lives here.</p>
<p><strong>7:00 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>This evening after dinner a concert is taking place in the lobby. I take a short walk around the building and come back in time for the music, a jazz band that includes my husband. At the end of the hour I slip away to keep another video appointment, with a client for whom usual working hours were not a possibility.</p>
<p>That’s part of the beauty of online therapy. I can meet my clients’ needs for appointments in the evening and on the weekends with no need for either of us to get in the car and drive to some otherwise-empty office building. I’ve been there, done that, and am very happy to have this alternative method of meeting. We’ll get as much done this way. It’s easier and feels safer than being out and driving at night.</p>
<p><strong>9:00 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>I relax, maybe watch some television while knitting. We might choose a movie on Netflix or Amazon, or reruns of the series, Blue Bloods, because I love it. It’s about family values and justice and always has a happy ending.</p>
<p>I need to see happy shows, especially true stories with happy endings, because my work life focuses on people’s struggles. I consciously avoid overloading myself with stuff that would upset me or pull me down. I already know how bad life can be. Something needs to remind me of how good it can be. And I love happy endings!</p>
<p><strong>11:00 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>I’m lying on my back, where I started in the morning, but this time I’m on my way to sleep. The window shades are open so I can see the outline of the trees against the darkened sky. Some nights I fall asleep fairly quickly, other nights the fibromyalgia keeps me awake with its full-body discomfort. One of the strategies I can use to help myself relax into sleep is to try to think of five things I accomplished during the day:</p>
<ol>
<li>I walked for exercise and fresh air.</li>
<li>I served my clients.</li>
<li>I practiced my harp.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it. I can’t think of any more. But I figure that if I count the number of clients I served, it definitely adds up to way more than five!</p>
<p>I still can’t fall asleep. I get up and move quietly into the living room, turn the TV on low, and watch some reruns of Golden Girls and Frasier. If I can laugh, even only once, that laughter will relax me and I’ll be able to go back to bed and fall asleep.</p>
<p>The shows are silly but brilliant. I marvel at the high quality of the writing and acting. Even though I know exactly what is going to happen (I’ve seen them all before so many times), I laugh aloud.</p>
<p>Then I go back to bed and drift to sleep. It’s the laughter that makes the difference. I was raised on it (my whole family loves to tell jokes), and it always works.</p>
<p>I fall asleep smiling, happy with my life, looking forward to tomorrow.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Name:</strong> Melissa Moreno, LCSW-R</p>
<p><strong>Licensing Info:</strong> Licensed Clinical Social Worker Psychotherapy &#8220;R&#8221; privilege [LCSW-R] in New York</p>
<p><strong>Where You Live:</strong> Ellenville, NY</p>
<p><strong>Amount of Time Working at Talkspace:</strong> 1 year</p>
<p><strong>Time Working as a Therapist:</strong> 11 years</p>
<p><strong>Why are you working in therapy/mental health?</strong></p>
<p>I have always been drawn to helping people improve their quality of life. Having overcome many personal challenges, I know first hand how important it is to be able to help others and have someone available when support is needed. I knew as a child that I wanted to be a therapist and help people with their mental health. I am grateful for having the ability to touch the lives of so many people through the process of therapy.<span id="more-6923"></span></p>
<p><strong>Why did you start working with Talkspace?</strong></p>
<p>I truly believe in the mission and philosophy of Talkspace. The flexibility of online therapy works for me and allows me to connect with individuals from all over the world, many of whom would not otherwise have access or be able to afford counseling. It is exciting to be a part of such a cutting edge mental health treatment.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Crisis Intervention Expert at Talkspace? What do they do?</strong></p>
<p>A Crisis Intervention Expert serves as a support and coach to the Talkspace therapists. I am available for consultation when a therapist has a client in crisis. I offer support, suggestions, and guidance with the Talkspace protocols for clients in crisis.</p>
<p><strong>Why is your work as a Crisis Intervention Expert important?</strong></p>
<p>My work as a Crisis Intervention Expert is important for a few reasons. It can be very stressful for therapists when a client is in crisis. I am the support for the therapists. The other reason this position is important is because we are dealing with clients in crisis who need clear and efficient responses. These crises can be high-risk situations that need immediate responses and sometimes steps to ensure safety.</p>
<p><strong>If you had one piece of advice for a therapy-seeker, what would it be?</strong></p>
<p>The biggest piece of advice I would offer is to have patience with yourself. The platform of Talkspace can take some time to get comfortable with, so I always encourage new users to have patience and ask questions along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a mental health hero?</strong></p>
<p>I absolutely love Dialectic Behavioral Therapy [DBT], so I would pick <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/03/these-famous-women-are-fighting-the-stigma-of-mental-illness/" target="_blank">Marsha Linehan</a> and Alec Miller as some of my mental health heros.</p>
<p><em>Note: To work with Melissa, you must sign up for Talkspace and live in the state she is licensed in.</em></p>

Talkspace’s “Meet Our Therapists” series offers intimate access to the mental health professionals who provide care. It’s a view of their passion for making therapy more accessible. Check out our latest interview below!</em></p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Alyssa Lentz</p>
<p><strong>Licensing Info:</strong> Licensed Professional Counselor [LPC] in Wisconsin (6329-125) and Texas (77669)</p>
<p><strong>Time Working With Talkspace:</strong> 6 months</p>
<p><strong>Time Working as a Therapist:</strong> 3 years</p>
<p><strong>Why are you working in therapy/mental health?</strong></p>
<p>I started working in the mental health field because, as long as I can remember, I&#8217;ve always wanted to help people. It&#8217;s not fun to battle mental health alone. I have struggled with anxiety and know how difficult it can be. I wanted to provide a nonjudgmental, safe place where people can open up and stop hiding.<span id="more-6826"></span></p>
<p><strong>Why did you want to start working with Talkspace?</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to start working for Talkspace because I believe there is a lot of power behind writing your thoughts out. I saw the value in having texting therapy as an option. Face-to-face therapy can be intimidating. Talkspace provides a platform where you can remain in the comfort of your own home and get the support you desire. It&#8217;s wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>What do you do for fun?</strong></p>
<p>For fun, I like to explore with my husband. We recently moved to Texas, so we like to get out and explore as much as possible. I also enjoy spending time with my dog, hiking, swimming, and hosting guests.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a mental health hero?</strong></p>
<p>My mental health heroes are my clients. They constantly teach me, and their strength inspires me. There is no better feeling than working with someone and seeing them achieve their goals. People are complex and some have endured tragic circumstances, yet they find a way to seek help, be vulnerable, and push through it. It&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<p><em>Note: To connect with Alyssa, you must live in one of the states she is licensed in. </em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Therapists are as unique as the clients who seek their help. Talkspace’s “Meet Our Therapists” series offers intimate access to the mental health professionals who provide care. It’s a view of their passion for making therapy more accessible. Check out our latest interview below!</p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Matt Lawson</p>
<p><strong>Licensing Info:</strong> Licensed Professional Counselor in Illinois</p>
<p><strong>Where You Live:</strong> Chicago, Illinois</p>
<p><strong>Time Working With Talkspace:</strong> 4 years</p>
<p><strong>Time Working as a Therapist:</strong> 7 years</p>
<p><strong>Why are you working in therapy/mental health?</strong></p>
<p>I got into therapy as a second career and went back to school in my early 30s. I had my own personal training business at the time and was seeing more and more people with eating disorders, body image issues, and a lot of other problems they were using exercise to escape from. To provide a deeper level of service, I needed more education and insight.<span id="more-6797"></span></p>
<p><strong>Why did you want to start working with Talkspace?</strong></p>
<p>Originally, I started working for Talkspace as a supplement while I was getting my private practice off the ground. As the years have gone by, it has become a more significant part of my professional life.</p>
<p><strong>What has made you feel the most pride in your work at Talkspace?</strong></p>
<p>As a consultation therapist, I get so see first hand the relief we provide to people who come here. Oftentimes simply getting started with therapy really puts people&#8217;s minds at ease. I take a lot of pride in what we offer and see so many people benefit. Many of them would have never gone to see someone face-to-face.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any special credentials, modalities, or specializations? If so, how do they complement your work as a whole?</strong></p>
<p>I am also a certified personal trainer and have maintained this part of my career for around 15 years. I have worked with hundreds of people on weight loss and healthy lifestyle creation. I tend to use a lot of CBT/DBT and ACT, with a client-centered lean, and have had multiple trainings with motivational interviewing and coaching.</p>
<p><strong>What do you do for fun?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m a total gym rat. Chicago really caters to my addiction with all the big clubs and boutique gyms. I regularly do mud runs, am a big fan of Crossfit, and will even throw a little Yoga in every once in awhile. I travel a lot and will get out of town two to three times a quarter. This flexibility underlines one of the best parts of working with Talkspace.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therapists are as unique as the clients who seek their help. Talkspace’s “Meet Our Therapists” series offers intimate access to the mental health professionals who provide care. It’s a view of their passion for making therapy more accessible. Check out our latest interview below!</span></p>
<p><b>Name:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Alicia Winkle</span></p>
<p><b>Licensing Info:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Licensed Professional Counselor [LPC #3290] in Alabama</span></p>
<p><b>Time Working With Talkspace:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2 years</span></p>
<p><b>Time Working as a Therapist: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 years</span></p>
<p><b>Why are you working in therapy/mental health?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve always wanted to be in the helping field. Originally, I was in school to be a nurse practitioner. After having <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/different-types-anxiety-disorders-classified/" target="_blank">anxiety issues </a>myself and dropping out of nursing school and college for a semester, I changed my major to psychology. From there I decided I wanted to help people overcome their own obstacles and make changes in their lives by working as a therapist. I went back to school at the University of North Alabama and got my master&#8217;s degree in Community Counseling. It was one of the best decisions I&#8217;ve ever made.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-6780"></span></p>
<p><b>Why did you want to start working with Talkspace?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My previous boss is actually the one who sent me a link to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talkspace" target="_blank">Talkspace</a>. I was intrigued by the possibility of providing therapy to people while they stayed at home. Seeing so many patients in my previous work with serious mental illnesses who struggle to get out of bed due to depression, and to leave their homes due to anxiety, made me think of all the people I could offer services to if I was a therapist on the platform. </span></p>
<p><b>What has made you feel the most pride in your work at Talkspace?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Definitely seeing clients make progress and hearing them say &#8220;thank you.&#8221; It&#8217;s pretty amazing for clients to be able to tell you minutes after big news happens to them, such as overcoming a significant obstacle in their lives or when something exciting happens, such as an engagement, having a child, etc. </span></p>
<p><b>Do you have any special credentials, modalities, or specializations? If so, how do they complement your work as a whole?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I focus on helping those struggling with anxiety and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/ptsd/" target="_blank">post traumatic stress disorder </a>[PTSD] symptoms. I am trained in Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [TF-CBT] that I utilize with children in private practice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Talkspace, I use other evidence-based practices to assist adults struggling with similar symptoms. It&#8217;s really amazing to see clients who have refused treatment, been unable to commute to an office, or are too anxious to see a therapist face-to-face receive and benefit from therapy on the Talkspace platform. </span></p>
<p><b>What do you do for fun?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love to be outside! The beauty of working with Talkspace is I can lay in my hammock and be productive or even work when traveling to the beach. I also love to run, camp, hike, kayak, and redo furniture. </span></p>
<p><b>Do you have a mental health hero?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have to say Carl Rogers. It would have been amazing to meet him! I&#8217;m a huge believer that progress cannot be made in therapy without a safe and accepting space provided by a therapist. If a therapist doesn&#8217;t believe in a client, it makes it near impossible for the client to completely fulfill their true potential. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don&#8217;t have to completely understand everything a client shares with us. But if we, as therapists, are there with the client and nonjudgmental — providing a safe and open environment where the client knows they are not being judged and are truly being listened to — amazing things can happen. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When life is challenging, we reflexively ask ourselves, “How can I feel better — fast?” At <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talkspace" target="_blank">Talkspace</a> many people connect with one of our therapists when they are going through a crisis and need someone to throw them a line. To offer some collective therapeutic wisdom, we asked therapists which pieces of advice they tend to give to clients who are going through a rough time.</p>
<p>Sometimes suffering gives you the opportunity to learn more about yourself, other people, and the world. That knowledge will ultimately help you make better choices and perhaps avoid situations that cause stress or heartbreak.</p>
<p>“When you know better, you do better,” said Talkspace therapist Chandricka Mose. “Look at the experience and take away the lesson you were meant to learn.”<span id="more-6395"></span></p>
<p>Talkspace therapist Kellie Mildenberger further explained how to make the most of tough times.</p>
<p>“In trying to help clients feel better about changes in life like jobs or relationships ending or other situations, I reframe and try to help the client see the opportunity in the change, accept and let go,” she said.</p>
<h2>On Losing a Loved One</h2>
<p>When you lose someone you loved, it can feel like losing a part of yourself. It can be difficult to fill that void and cope with grief.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Because your loved one is physically gone doesn&#8217;t mean the relationship has to end. Find a way to celebrate their memory by doing a balloon release, writing a letter, visiting a place you both enjoyed. Be creative and make it meaningful to both of you.” &#8211; Alyssa Lentz, Talkspace Therapist</p>
<p>“I typically encourage clients to exercise and eat healthy first and foremost. I also encourage journaling their feelings about the loss. I encourage social activities, getting back into things they were passionate about: a hobby, talent, or skill.” &#8211; Kristen Caldwell, Talkspace Therapist</p></blockquote>
<h2>On Going Through a Breakup</h2>
<p>When a romantic relationship ends, it can feel like your ex took a part of your self-worth. This can lead to depression, in addition to feelings of grief from losing the relationship. To keep your mental health intact, you will need to go out of your way to be positive.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I stress the importance of positive self-talk — breaking away from the negative thinking: &#8216;You left me. I&#8217;m not worthy of being loved. I&#8217;m worthless. Why can&#8217;t I get over it as easy as he/she did?,’ etc. I ask them to tell themselves they are doing the very best they can with where they are right now.” &#8211; Kristen Caldwell, Talkspace Therapist</p></blockquote>
<h2>On Losing Your Job</h2>
<p>Getting laid off or fired is stressful and can damage your self-esteem. Even our CEO struggled to take care of his mental health after his old company abruptly fired him. Talkspace therapist Melissa Moreno offered some tips to cope with unemployment and bounce back as quickly as possible:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stay Positive — While it can be emotionally taxing to lose a job, it is not good to dwell on that hardship or “badmouth” a previous employer. Remain focused on the task at hand: finding a new position.</p>
<p><strong>Update your resume</strong> — 1-2 page max for resume, focus on your strengths, add color (heading, name), include data (increased sales by 50%). There are many websites and articles about how to update a resume and what employers are looking for in a resume.</p>
<p><strong>Remarket Yourself</strong> — Take a class or explore a trade or field of interest. Sometimes difficult situations are actually opportunities to learn and grow. Although we may not have chosen to leave our job, it has ended and it is our responsibility to figure out the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Network</strong> — Staying connected to others is important and can lead to a job. Such things as volunteering, reaching out to colleges or past employers may give you information about a job opening you weren’t otherwise aware of.</p>
<p><strong>Cut Back</strong> — Evaluate how and where you are spending money. Cut back on the things you don’t need (ordering out, extra TV channels, laundry services). There are many areas we are able to save money. The first step is evaluating the spending.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Therapy Is Actually More Than a Place to Feel Better</h2>
<p>Many people start therapy when they are going through a tough time and want to feel better. That’s a big part of what therapy provides, but it goes far beyond that. If you want to get the most out of working with a therapist, getting through the worst of the pain is only the starting point.</p>
<p>By continuing treatment past the crisis, you can develop coping skills to make future challenges less painful. Therapy is an opportunity to become a better version of yourself and discover new ways to live a happier life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Psychotherapists are sometimes skeptical about online therapy. Some of the concerns stem from the medium itself. They imagine that it’s difficult to build relationships online, that the lack of body language limits its effectiveness, that tone and nuance are lost in communication. Other concerns center around hours of availability, fear about managing emergencies, or about licensing restrictions.</p>
<p>The vast majority of therapists, however, are interested in embracing new technologies — tools that help them be more data-driven, more available, and better able to track client progress. They’re passionate about how technology can empower their practice, but worry about using it in a safe way that doesn’t endanger their clients’ privacy or expose them to undue liability, as communicating via SMS, email, or Skype does.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talkspace" target="_blank">Talkspace</a> is one of the technologies helping therapists reach new clients — a HIPAA certified platform that provides a more convenient therapy experience for clients and therapists, one that employs banking-grade encryption and is fully compliant with state licensing regulations. Talkspace also has strict protocols in place to handle emergency situations, including an on-staff Crisis Intervention Expert, continual client risk assessments, and a secure on-platform tool to capture emergency contact information. Talkspace therapists typically set their own flexible hours and reply to clients twice daily on business days.<span id="more-6207"></span></p>
<p>Expanding one’s practice means helping more people in need, increasing access to vital mental health care, and decreasing stigma. Talkspace helps clinicians reach people from all walks of life — who may have never experienced the benefits of therapy — on a flexible schedule. With options for live video chat, the capability to send video and audio, and a text format that allows clients read through the transcripts of interactions with their therapist — a sort of therapy logbook — many clients feel they develop a deeper sense of connection with their online therapist than through brick-and-mortar therapy. Above all, it provides evidence-based quality of care that meets people where they are: in digital spaces.</p>
<p>We spoke with three therapists about why they decided to work for Talkspace, what attracted them initially, and how they’ve found the experience since they began working.</p>
<h2>Reaching More People, More Securely</h2>

Talkspace Provider since February 2016<br />
Has helped 48 clients with Talkspace</p>
<p>Initially I was skeptical about working with clients solely via text-based therapy. But I wanted to reach more people who lived outside of my area, travelled for work or were homebound, recovering from surgery.</p>
<p>I had been trying to launch an online therapy service on my own but wasn’t reaching many people. When I found out Talkspace had a secure platform for working with clients, I decided to check it out.</p>
<p>Together clients and therapists are trying something new: using technology to overcome barriers to participate in counseling services. I feel like I took a risk in trying something new and am helping pioneer a new resource for people who want to consult a licensed mental health professional.</p>
<p>As they would in an office setting, people do experience personal growth via working with a counselor online. I am no longer a skeptic.</p>
<h2>Safe Care To Those In Need, On My Schedule</h2>

<p>Staying on top of innovative psychology and technology is critical to me. When I first read about Talkspace, my first thought was, “This is an important shift in mental health services, and I want to be a part of it.” I have been facilitating webinars and online therapy and supervision for almost 10 years, so being involved in Talkspace made sense to me.</p>
<p>In addition to my work at Talkspace, I travel throughout the world facilitating seminars and workshops on Art Therapy. Talkspace fits into my schedule. I can stay connected to my clients while I am in a hotel or on the airplane, and they do not have to wait a week or more for me to return to my office in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>As a therapist, a parent, and a person, I have experienced the limitations the traditional mental health field has created. It can be expensive, inconvenient, and can carry a stigma.</p>
<p>Talkspace has removed all those aspects and retained the essential component of one-on-one, personalized therapy from experienced and licensed therapists. I am proud to be a part of that.</p>
<p>I am excited to be working with people from all over the world who may not have access to the specific type of therapist they need. I feel good knowing my clients on Talkspace can reach out to me when they need to, and not have to wait a week or more to express their concerns.</p>
<h2>Technology’s Leading Edge That Maintains Personalized Care</h2>
<p><strong>Marla Harrity, LMFT</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-6246 alignleft" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Marla-Harrity-150x150.png" alt="marla harrity talkspace therapist headshot" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Marla-Harrity-150x150.png 150w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Marla-Harrity-300x300.png 300w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Marla-Harrity.png 440w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></p>

<p><em>Is that some kind pseudoscience</em>, I thought after first hearing about the concept of online therapy many years ago. Certainly genuineness and unconditional positive regard are foundational elements for any therapeutic relationship. How would that translate to the virtual world?</p>
<p>I first became intrigued by the idea of increased flexibility that online therapy would allow for my schedule. Talkspace embraces the “anywhere, anytime” mentality not just for clients, but for therapists as well. Being in an on-demand world, I was initially concerned about boundaries and balancing my personal and professional life without the four protective walls of a therapy suite. Expectations for immediacy, and quick responses, seem to increase all the time. But I learned that client accessibility is not to be confused with dependence or demand. Instead, clients build independence on Talkspace by being able to track thoughts and log messages throughout the day, allowing for more time for consideration and deeper reflection as they share.</p>
<p>Talkspace is committed to the idea of making therapy accessible to all — something I’ve been committed to in my own practice. For the young woman on medical bed rest, the agoraphobic man too afraid to leave his home, the single mom who is tight on money, and the business professional who can’t commit to a weekly appointment — making the trip to the therapist’s office can be difficult. I’ve heard this from clients and seen it in via cancelled appointments. I’ve always worked under the principle of “meeting clients where they’re at.” True therapeutic growth comes when clients feel comfortable and I’ve found that Talkspace allows users to build an authentic and trusting relationship. All it takes is for us to reimagine what that therapy room looks like.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve shaken myself from the one-dimensional structure of what therapy used to be and have expanded my approach to therapy into an online platform. Staying at the forefront of our field is important to me, and I’ve been able to embrace that challenge with Talkspace.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The basic definition of a mental health counselor is simple. Understanding all of what the term can mean, however, is more complicated.</p>
<p>Mental health counselors are licensed professionals who help people manage and overcome mental and emotional disorders and problems with family and other relationships, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/community-and-social-service/mental-health-counselors-and-marriage-and-family-therapists.htm" target="_blank">according to</a> the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They communicate with clients to understand their problems and develop strategies to improve their lives.</p>
<p>Depending on the context, “mental health counselor” can refer to a specific license rather than the actual work. Mental health professionals can earn the proper mental health counselor license, but their daily work might not involve counseling. Before or after their clinical work, many become administrators, educators, or consultants. Nonetheless, most professionals who advertise themselves as mental health counselors provide mental health support as their primary source of income.<span id="more-5832"></span></p>
<p>To receive an appropriate license, mental health counselors need to have earned a master’s degree in a relevant psychological field, completed a specific number of hours of clinical training under a supervisor, and passed the licensing exam in their state. There are a few names for the licenses and profession, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Licensed Mental Health Counselor [LMHC]</li>
<li>Licensed Professional Counselor [LPC]</li>
<li>Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor [LCPC].</li>
</ul>
<p>These licenses vary by state, although LMHC is the most common.</p>
<h2>Clarifying the Terms: Mental Health Counselor vs. Therapist, Psychologist and Social Worker</h2>
<p>Many people use the terms “mental health counselor,” “<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a>,” and “psychologist” interchangeably. It is often a matter of preference, branding, or a feeling that one word best suits an identity. Unfortunately this creates confusion among professionals and potential clients.</p>
<p>Unlike “mental health counselor,” “therapist” is not a license nor is it listed in the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It is an umbrella term to describe various mental health professionals who primarily work with clients to improve their mental health. “Psychologist” is also an umbrella term that describes mental health professionals. It does, however, tend to refer more often to people who conduct research. Mental health counselors can conduct research as well, but they usually work primarily with clients.</p>
<p>People who have social work licenses can also provide counseling and refer to themselves as mental health counselors. Social workers can also fall under the umbrella of therapists or psychologists.</p>
<h2>Considerations When Looking for a Mental Health Counselor</h2>
<p>If you are searching for a licensed professional to help you cope with mental health issues and improve your life, remember to look past licenses and job titles. Widen your search using all of the terms discussed in this article. When you find a potential match with a “mental health counselor,” check their specialization and what their work entails. For example, a Licensed Clinical Social Worker [LCSW] who calls himself a mental health counselor could end up being a better fit than a LMHC.</p>
<h2>Becoming a Mental Health Counselor</h2>
<p>If you’re interested in becoming a mental health counselor, start by considering where you are in your career and what field you’re looking to join. Do you already have a master’s degree? What are your salary expectations? What population do you hope to work with?</p>
<p>Here are some resources that can guide you:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/community-and-social-service/mental-health-counselors-and-marriage-and-family-therapists.htm" target="_blank">Occupational Outlook for Mental Health Counselors</a></li>
<li><a href="http://psychologydegreeguide.org/degree/masters-degree/" target="_blank">List of Master’s Degree in Psychology Programs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.counseling.org/docs/licensure/72903_excerpt_for_web.pdf" target="_blank">Counselor License Requirements by State</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Looking Beyond the Words</h2>
<p>When you see terms that describe mental health professionals, remember to research beyond the basic definitions. Each term has different connotations that sometimes distract from what is most important. Ultimately it is a mental health professional’s skillset, experience, and work that defines them.</p>
