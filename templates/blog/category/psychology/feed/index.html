				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At a young age, many of us are taught that telling a lie is <i>absolutely</i> bad. Yet as we grow up, we slowly become exposed to small, “white” lies — those told to keep us from becoming upset or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/sadness-or-depression-how-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sad</a>. Even as we transition into adulthood, well-meaning lies are often told to shield a person from criticism or added hardship. But can we ever be sure telling a lie is the right thing to do?<span id="more-11427"></span></p>
<h2>Why We Tell White Lies</h2>
<p>As a parent, using white lies to help prevent a child from feeling upset is a common practice, and according to <a href="&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28493758“" target="”_blank”">research</a>, is socially acceptable across many cultures. A parent, for instance, may tell small lies to keep a child from worrying about a missing stuffed animal, or calm their fear of getting a shot at the doctor’s office. Often, this act is perceived as being compassionate and is considered a “<a href="&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597814000983“" target="”_blank”">prosocial lie</a>,” which entails a person lying to prevent harm to another individual.</p>
<p>Even into adulthood, those “smaller” lies often continue. Many adults may feel they are put in situations where lying is the only ethical option. If a person asks you how they look on their wedding day, for instance, there is only one acceptable answer, despite what your honest opinion may be. In a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/09/assert-yourself-at-work/">work</a> setting, the same may be true when it comes to interactions with your boss or in situations where you feel the need to prevent someone’s embarrassment or discomfort when receiving criticism.</p>
<p>The question then becomes whether this type of lie is less harmful than just being honest from the start.</p>
<h2>Is Lying Ever Undeniably Bad?</h2>
<p>If every lie told could prevent harm to another person, without any ill-effects, it would make the answer to this question more clear. But in reality, falsely telling someone they did a fantastic job when they did not, or letting someone believe they are a contender for a promotion, when they are not, can result in more harm than good.</p>
<p>This type of lie — a <a href="&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074959781630509X?via%3Dihub“" target="”_blank”">paternalistic</a> lie — requires the deceiver to make assumptions about whether the lie is in the best interest of the person receiving it. This results in strong resentment from deceived parties, and in many cases, backfires.</p>
<p>To help encourage more honesty in your professional and personal life and avoid the need to lie, make sure you are creating settings where you feel comfortable telling the truth (and are helping others feel they can do so as well). By being honest as much as possible you can create conditions where those around you feel heard and believed. This will help to stop deception with positive intent.</p>
<h2>How to Decide When to Lie</h2>
<p>While some may choose to stick with honesty as the best and only policy, if you do choose to tell a lie or skew the truth in some way, consider the following two factors: The size and intention of the lie — are your reason prosocial, paternalistic, or are they purely deceptive and malicious — and the potential repercussions if you are caught. While it may be the <i>best </i>policy, as we’ve seen, the truth is not the only policy. Some lies are necessary and even justified.</p>
<p>Even if the lie seems harmless at the surface, it’s important to weigh these considerations before deciding if it is better left unsaid. And remember, if you’re honest, it’s easier to keep your story straight and won’t have any negative impact on your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/why-successful-people-struggle-with-mental-illness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health</a> (like feeling guilty about your deceit).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s typically easy to recognize “problematic” mental health — most of the time we know how to recognize <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depression</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/stress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stress</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/11/fighting-style-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conflict</a>&#8230;the list goes on. When we strive for good mental health, however, it’s a little harder to figure out exactly what that means.</p>
<p>What is good mental health, and how do we know when we’ve got it? Everything you need to know can be found below.<span id="more-11416"></span></p>
<h2>New Thinking About an Old Problem</h2>
<p>Even experts have trouble agreeing on what good mental health looks like, so a group of psychiatry researchers recently reviewed ideas from around the world, hoping for a more useful and standardized way to think about mental health.</p>
<p>The authors crafted a definition that fits well with what mental health professionals look for when working with clients. Unfortunately, their definition is not very clear to most people outside the clinical and professional worlds of psychology and psychology.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4471980/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">paper</a>, these authors proposed the following definition:</p>
<p><i>“Mental health is a dynamic state of internal equilibrium which enables individual to use their abilities in harmony with universal values of society. Basic cognitive and social skills; ability to recognize, express, and modulate one’s own emotions, as well as empathize with others; feasibility and ability to cope with adverse life events and function in social roles; and harmonious relationships between body and mind represent important components of mental health which contribute, to varying degrees, to the state of internal equilibrium.”</i></p>
<p>What a mouthful! What does this definition really mean?</p>
<h2>Good Mental Health Explained</h2>
<p>Fortunately, these authors broke down their definition in a way that helps us make sense of it. Using their explanations as a guideline, let’s look at what this definition tells us about good mental health.</p>
<h3>Dynamic equilibrium</h3>
<p>We can’t be happy all the time. In fact, being happy in the midst of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/loneliness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tragedy</a> could actually be a sign of poor mental health. How we <i>feel</i> is less important than whether the feelings objectively match the situation. In addition, our ability to recover from stressors matters.</p>
<p>In short, dynamic equilibrium is just a fancy way to say that our reactions fit the circumstances, but we bounce back when life throws curve balls (better known as “resilience”).</p>
<h3>Cognitive and social skills</h3>
<p>Good mental health depends on our ability to think, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/what-flaking-on-plans-says-about-your-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plan</a>, and act in socially effective ways. It’s possible to have some problems in this area but still function effectively.</p>
<p>Many people function well because they use their strengths to make up for their deficits. For example, someone with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/time-management-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADHD</a> might compensate by using organizers and timers, while someone who’s naturally shy might bring a friend along to a new social activity.</p>
<h3>Empathy</h3>
<p>Empathy allows you to understand someone else’s thoughts and feelings based on your own experiences. It helps us get along with other people.</p>
<p>A callous, uncaring person is likely to have chronic lack of empathy. On the other hand, being too empathic to stand up for yourself when necessary can lead to greater issues, such as anxiety or depression. Appropriate empathy keeps our relationships intact even as we meet our own needs.</p>
<h3>Flexibility and adaptability</h3>
<p>Good mental health requires us to accept life’s inevitable changes, then adjust our behaviors to function adequately. In other words, we roll with life’s punches.</p>
<p>It’s normal for bad things to upset us. Good mental health requires us to accept that change happens, then choose healthy behaviors to handle the new situation effectively.</p>
<h3>Mind/body connection</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/5-ways-improve-body-image-confidence-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poor diet</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/the-surprising-new-connection-between-sleep-and-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lack of sleep</a>, and inadequate physical activity affect our minds just as they do our bodies, because mind and body are one and the same. A mind can’t be healthy if its home is crumbling around it.</p>
<h2>Putting it All Together</h2>
<p>While older definitions of mental health focus heavily on <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/what-is-happiness-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happiness</a> or were limited to a single society’s values, the authors of the new study developed a broader definition. Their work offers a good explanation of what mental health professionals look for when we decide how to help our clients.</p>
<p>It’s normal to be unhappy sometimes, to worry sometimes, to get angry when someone wrongs you, or grieve when someone leaves. The most important things are:</p>
<ol>
<li>How well you function in all of your roles,</li>
<li>Whether you bounce back from challenges effectively, and</li>
<li>How you use your strengths to make up for deficits.</li>
</ol>
<p>No matter what your diagnosis or challenge, a therapist’s goal is to help you function at your best using the abilities you have. When you seek the same for yourself, positive changes naturally follow.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What defense mechanisms are holding you back?</p>
<p>Psychoanalytic theory holds that there are certain <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/11/how-dangerous-is-denial/">defense mechanisms</a> that people use in order to cope with life stressors. While it’s normal to have and employ defense mechanisms, they can, paradoxically, end up making your life a lot harder in the long run.<span id="more-11413"></span></p>
<p>Defense mechanisms can make us feel better about things in the short term, but read on if you want to explore which of them may be sabotaging your long term chances at <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/what-is-happiness-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happiness</a>.</p>
<h2>Common Defense Mechanisms, and How They Can Affect You</h2>
<p>There is a long list of defense mechanisms, but these are some of the most common, issue-prone examples that I see in my practice.</p>
<h3>Denial</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/11/how-dangerous-is-denial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Denial</a> is a classic defense mechanism, whereby you deny the existence of something that is too difficult or uncomfortable to deal with. This is used frequently by those struggling with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/addiction-mental-illness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">addiction</a>, or with many mental health issues.</p>
<p>You can recognize this if you’ve ever told yourself something like, “I’m not drinking too much, I barely had three drinks last night and they were watered down,” despite your friends remembering you had closer to 8 or 10.</p>
<p>It is obvious that denying a problem doesn’t make it go away, and makes it impossible to confront or resolve, which is why it’s essential to recognize if denial is your go-to defense mechanism.</p>
<h3>Projection</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/projecting-problems-onto-your-partner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Projection</a> is when someone feels so ashamed of acting a certain way, they instead act like someone else is exhibiting the behavior that they are guilty of.</p>
<p>For example, a wife who knows that she yells too much at her kids may accuse her husband of having anger management issues. While one part of her mind knows that she is the one with an <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/anger-emotions-run-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anger</a> problem, she is so ashamed of directly confronting this fact that her brain subconsciously projects her insecurity onto someone else; in this case, her husband.</p>
<h3>Displacement</h3>
<p>Displacement is when you use a replacement object as the recipient of feelings or behaviors, because you’re afraid to direct the energy toward the person you’re really thinking about.</p>
<p>For instance, a man angry at his boss for passing him over for a promotion may find it much too terrifying to think about confronting his boss. He may also may be ashamed to consider that he wasn’t promoted do to his <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/11/receiving-feedback-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">performance</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, his subconscious gives him a convenient out, and redirects his anger. He comes home at night and instantly tears into his son for being “lazy” and playing <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/11/is-video-gaming-addiction-real/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video games</a> all afternoon.</p>
<h3>Repression</h3>
<p>When feelings are too intense, uncomfortable, or taboo, then our subconscious hides them from our conscious mind.</p>
<p>For example, if a woman feels jealous of her sister’s <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/its-time-to-screen-all-pregnant-women-for-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pregnancy</a>, she may push this feeling out of consciousness and repress it entirely. Unfortunately though, when feelings are repressed, they don’t disappear as neatly as the person wishes they would.</p>
<p>In this case, the woman may end up avoiding her sister or lashing out at her, although she remains consciously unaware of why. As you can imagine, exploring what’s at the root of her behavior would likely help her to understand it and to be more supportive.</p>
<h2>Sound Familiar? A Professional Can Help.</h2>
<p>If you recognize these defense mechanisms in yourself — and you very well may since they are so common — then think deeply about the impact that they may have on your life.</p>
<p>Choosing not to deal with your subconscious feelings or your actual behaviors can significantly hold you back in life. Working with a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">therapist</a>, or doing your own introspection, can make you more aware of your defense mechanisms, allowing you to behave in a way that is more consistent with your goals and values.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot of the time, impulsive people truly can’t help their behavior. In fact, some folks are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3638385/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">genetically predisposed to impulsivity</a>, and a handful of mental illnesses such as <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/impulsive-behavior-and-bpd-425483" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">borderline personality disorder</a> and <a href="https://www.bphope.com/bipolar-and-controlling-impulsivity/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">bipolar disorder</a> are characterized by impulsive behaviors. You don’t have to have a mental illness to act impulsively, but engaging in such behaviors might be wreaking more havoc on your mental health than you thought.</p>
<p>Here are 5 examples of (many different) impulsive behaviors that could be destroying your mental health.</p>
<p><span id="more-11408"></span></p>
<h2>Excessive Drinking</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/when-weekend-drinking-turns-into-a-problem/">Excessive drinking</a> and binge drinking are dangerous, as <a href="https://www.drinkaware.co.uk/alcohol-facts/health-effects-of-alcohol/mental-health/alcohol-and-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">alcohol alters chemicals in the brain </a>and affects how neurotransmitters function, which is crucial for good mental health.</p>
<p>We all know that drinking has a way of making us release our inhibitions&#8230;and that isn’t necessarily a good thing. For example, the impulsiveness of excessive drinking can lead to even more regrettable impulsive behaviors, like starting a fight or having unprotected sex. Alcohol is a depressant, and excessive <a href="https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/alcohol-and-depresssion#1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">drinking can make a depressed person more depressed</a>, as well as more likely to contemplate suicide or self harm.</p>
<h2>Taking Drugs</h2>
<p>There’s a slew of dangerous drugs out there that can cause both long- and short-term negative effects on the mind. Many drugs are highly addictive, so what started as an impulsive decision (to try a certain drug) can result in full blown dependency, especially in someone already predisposed to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/attending-mental-health-addiction-recovery/">addiction</a>.</p>
<p>Drugs create changes in the brain, ranging from <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/health-consequences-drug-misuse/mental-health-effects" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">paranoia to hallucinations</a> — and those effects might not stop when your trip is over. For example, using methamphetamine can increase the <a href="https://drugabuse.com/library/mental-health-and-drug-abuse/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">risk of schizophrenia symptoms</a>, and <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/cocaine-may-play-role-in-depression-62768" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">using cocaine long term alters the brain</a> in a way that makes it harder to feel pleasure and happiness without using drugs.</p>
<h2>Becoming Violent &amp; Aggressive</h2>
<p>Everyone gets angry from time to time, but most people are able to resist actual violence. However, some folks have trouble containing their rage and impulsively end up physically fighting someone, punching objects, breaking things, or yelling.</p>
<p>In the long run, resorting to violence and aggression when angry will result in an inability process anger in a healthy way. Plus, people who lash out are likely to experience guilt and shame after their violent episode.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/10/types-of-domestic-violence-signs-what-you-can-do/">Domestic violence</a> is also a problem for those with impulse control issues, making a healthy relationship unsustainable, and traumatizing your partner. Not to mention, there are financial and legal implications if you damage somebody’s property, or worse, physically injure someone.</p>
<h2>Gambling</h2>
<p>Some people can gamble responsibly, putting a few dollars on black or enjoying the camaraderie and excitement of a weekly card game with friends. However, an impulsive bet on a horse race or a big win from a slot machine can expose somebody to a gambler’s high, fueled by adrenaline and the excitement of risk taking.</p>
<p>When a gambling habit gets out of hand, it can cause a multitude of problems in someone’s personal life. Gambling can eat up your time, leave you in debt, or cause you to pay more attention to the habit instead of important things in life, like relationships or work.</p>
<p>Overall mood and <a href="https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/a-to-z/g/gambling-and-mental-health" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">happiness may become dependent on gambling wins</a>, and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/dealing-depression-need-know/">depression</a> is likely to occur when a gambler takes big losses. Gambling can also become a means of escapism. Due to a lack of coping skills, escapists can’t sit with their problems and emotions in a healthy way.</p>
<h2>Binge Eating</h2>
<p>Yes, food seems to get more delicious by the year, and available at the touch of a finger and in a near-instant, but a line needs to be drawn somewhere! As with the other impulsive behaviors, what may start as “treat yourself” self-care can turn into a full blown habit&#8230;in some cases, an eating disorder.</p>
<p>When impulse control is lacking, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/06/eating-disorders-story-awareness/">binge eating </a>can turn into a serious problem. People who binge might become reliant on food to help them deal with stress or negative emotions. If they’re having a bad day and food is in front of them, they might not be able to stop eating — even past the point of feeling full. Oftentimes, binge eating results in a vicious cycle that perpetuates <a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/eating-disorders/binge-eating-disorder/features/binge-eating-disorder-body-image#1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">poor self esteem</a>.</p>
<h2>A Professional Can Help Curb Impulsive Behaviors</h2>
<p>To stop making dangerous, impulsive decisions, you have to make a conscious effort to change your ways and get help.And there’s no better time to turn things around than now.</p>
<p>Impulsive behaviors can have long term effects on both physical and mental wellbeing. If you’re not sure if you have a serious problem with these behaviors, chat with a doctor or mental health professional to get some feedback.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Is this normal?”</p>
<p>As a therapist who works with children and teens, I hear this question frequently. Adolescents go through changes in such a short period, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/steps-adolescents-can-take-reduce-chronic-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teens</a> (and parents) may wonder if they’re losing their grip.<span id="more-11377"></span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, many teens don’t share these thoughts with their <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/online-therapy-is-a-godsend-for-busy-parents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parents</a>. This, however, can have long-term consequences, so it’s important we don’t ignore our teen’s mental health and the potential long-term suffering associated. Consider these facts from the <a href="https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-By-the-Numbers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">National Alliance on Mental Illness</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>About 1 in 5 people between ages 13 and 18 experience a severe mental disorder</li>
<li>Half of all long-term mental illness begins by age 14</li>
<li>Suicide is the 3rd leading cause of death for people age 10-14, 2nd for those aged 15-24</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Teen’s Changing Brain</h2>
<p>People assume puberty (and its surrounding awkwardness) is the only thing teens worry about. They often ignore the biggest influencer of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/control-emotions-cognitive-behavioral-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mood</a> and mental health — the brain.</p>
<p>As a teen’s body grows, so does their brain. During development it often changes in new, confusing ways — for both the teen and their parent. In early adolescence, teens tend to think in black-or-white, paying most attention to what’s immediately in front of them.</p>
<p>Later, when they’re a little older and their brain has finished developing, they may notice connections they hadn’t previously. Their thoughts turn toward the future and who they’d like to become. Friends become more important. They build their own values, often very different from those of parents or teachers.</p>
<p>In addition, some areas of the brain develop faster than others. Teenagers are just beginning to think about long-term consequences, even as they’re making sometimes confounding and impulsive decisions.</p>
<p>For example, your child may be determined to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/09/lower-high-expectations-in-college/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">graduate</a> on time, but choose to watch YouTube instead of studying for big tests. The unevenness of this development can lead to frustration from those who care most about their future — i.e., parents, guardians, and teachers.</p>
<h2>Common Teen Mental Health Problems</h2>
<p>Hormones present during puberty combine with these new ways of thinking, sometimes causing chaos in adolescent thought patterns. In addition to genetics and environmental factors, this is one reason why teens are at risk for numerous mental health or behavioral problems, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/eating-disorders-body-image/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eating Disorders</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anxiety</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Depression</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/addiction-mental-illness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Substance Abuse</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/time-retire-self-harm-alternatives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Violence/Self-harm</a></li>
<li>Legal Problems</li>
<li><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/how-to-deal-with-multiple-mental-illnesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Psychotic Disorders</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These changes are enough to make <i>anyone</i> feel a little unstable, so it’s important to pinpoint the difference between normal teenage stress and more serious problems.</p>
<h2>Fear of Getting Help</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.nccp.org/publications/pub_878.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">National Center for Children in Poverty</a>, up to a third of teens with mental illness don’t get the help they need. Why?</p>
<p>Aside from the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/stigma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stigma</a> mental illness carries, many teens worry about who will find out about their problems if they get help. They often don’t want parents or friends to know. Although teens sometimes underestimate their parents’ ability to help them work through their issues, many do in fact need help from an unbiased counselor outside the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/therapists-guide-talking-friends-family-about-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">family</a>. Additionally, while parents or guardians may feel a sense of shame that their teen needs help — that they’ve failed in some ways as a parent — this is most often not the case. Mental health conditions do not discriminate and struggle is not indicative of moral failure. The important thing is getting them help.</p>
<p>Depending on state of residence, teens can sometimes get mental health treatment without their parents’ permission. In most states (each state is different and there are exceptions) their counsellor will keep issues confidential — unless they’re a danger to themselves or others. Teen safety is the number one priority for counselor and mental health professionals and it’s important that you give your teen the space to work out issues that may feel too close or too uncomfortable to discuss with a close family member.</p>
<p><a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/talkspace-for-teens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Talkspace for Teens</a> requires a parent or guardian’s consent, but the process is streamlined so that your teen should be able to receive the care of a licensed counselor within just a few hours of signing up. Talkspace for Teens also employs banking-grade security to ensure your teen’s security. And rest assured, all of the 3,000+ counselors are experienced, licensed mental health professionals who have been through Talkspace’s rigorous vetting, credentialing, and onboarding process.</p>
<h2>Warning Signs</h2>
<p>Regardless of the rules in your state, pay attention to the following warning signs, which may signal you should seek help for your teen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their symptoms distract them in many settings — struggles are on their mind no matter what they do.</li>
<li>Grades or job performance get worse and stay that way over weeks or months.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Relationships</a> suffer. They can’t get along with loved ones or they isolate themself.</li>
<li>Their moods feel out of control. Their usual coping strategies — the ways they deal with issues — no longer help to control their anger, worry, or sadness.</li>
<li>They take more risks. Exploring new things, including <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/alcohol-abuse-signs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alcohol</a>, drugs, or sex, is mostly common, but behavior that puts them or others in danger should be a warning sign.</li>
<li>They often think about hurting themselves or others. Many teens experience such thoughts occasionally, but they need immediate help if they can’t control them or they want to act on them.</li>
<li>They hear or see things others can’t, or their thinking gets confused or paranoid. Although rare, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, or fear that others are trying to harm them can be signs of a serious medical problem.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mental Health Resources for Teens</h2>
<p>Parents or guardians usually understand and care more than kids think, but in some cases, parents might not be the only resource they need. It’s important for them to talk to family members they trust, but if they don’t feel comfortable doing so, there are options:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a> Available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with text option.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nami.org/Find-Support" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">National Alliance on Mental Illness Help Line</a> Also available 24/7 with text option.</li>
<li><a href="https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">SAMHSA Behavioral Health Services Locator</a> Finds providers in your area; offers a 24/7 hotline.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.settogo.org/for-students/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Set to Go</a> Intended for people moving to college, but includes mental health information helpful to all teens.</li>
<li>School resources. Guidance counselors or school nurses may be able to talk with you confidentially at school, or tell you about other options near you.</li>
<li>Your doctor’s office. Many doctors have someone on call to answer questions. You can call anonymously, ask if they see teens without parental consent, or ask for local provider names.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/talkspace-for-teens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Talkspace for Teens</a> is also an inexpensive, convenient way to access behavioral health care. Teens can send unlimited text, video, picture, and audio messages to their counselor from an app on their phone or from a web browser — anytime, anywhere. There’s no need to schedule appointments or commute to an office, and they won’t have to miss school or activities.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://research.talkspace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent study of Talkspace users</a> showed that 93% of participants reported improvement on their toughest problems in as little as 2 months and 90% said they preferred Talkspace to traditional counseling. In addition to the effectiveness and convenience, Talkspace for Teens is also about 80% more affordable than brick-and-mortar counseling.</p>
<p>Stress is normal throughout adolescence, but it’s important to get your teen help if they’re struggling. Just like homework, a job, or college taking care of one’s mental health now is a great investment in the future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/what-is-happiness-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Happiness</a> — it&#8217;s one of the most common life goals shared by people from every corner of the globe. While this highly sought-after feeling may be shared, few people are confident about how exactly to achieve it.<span id="more-11351"></span></p>
<p>You may catch yourself feeling a pang of jealousy when viewing an ad for diamonds, or feel you haven’t reached your maximum level of worth at work. Shrouding ourselves in the feeling maybe we&#8217;d be happier if we could just achieve or earn more keeps our minds fixated on the superficial aspects of happiness.</p>
<p>How exactly do you find a sense of peace and satisfaction at the current stage of your life? Below, we&#8217;ll outline simple ways in which you can find happiness — beginning with the small steps that you can take today.</p>
<h2>End Unhealthy Habits</h2>
<p>Sometimes, it’s an unhealthy habit that may keep you from enjoying the optimal level of happiness in your life.</p>
<p>If your unhappiness stems from a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/6-helpful-tips-on-how-to-unleash-your-motivation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lack of energy</a>, search for ways to combat fatigue, such as cutting unhealthy foods out of your diet. If you find yourself frustrated instead by a lack of free time, make an effort to reduce procrastination.</p>
<p>Some <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fixing-families/201712/how-break-bad-habits" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tips for breaking a bad habit</a> that&#8217;ll make it easier for you to achieve your happiness goals include identifying triggers, developing substitutes, changing larger patterns, and rewarding yourself.</p>
<h2>Cut the Comparisons</h2>
<p>You log onto Facebook and see that your coworker just bought the newest model Subaru. You <i>were</i> okay with your 2009 Ford — until now.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to fall into the trap of comparing our worth to that of others. When you receive constant <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/managing-social-media-intake-without-quitting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media</a> updates that show pictures of your friends on their getaway vacation, it&#8217;s difficult not to feel a sense of discontent with your own life.</p>
<p>While comparisons are natural, it&#8217;s best to shy away from the idea that others&#8217; happiness takes away from your own. Remember that on social networks, you only see the positive aspects of your friends&#8217; lives. What you <i>don&#8217;t</i> see is the struggle and hardships they experience, too.</p>
<p>Whenever you hear that a co-worker recently got a raise, or that one of your friend&#8217;s just got engaged, congratulate them and remember to stay focused on creating the best life path for yourself.</p>
<p>3. Surround Yourself with People, Not Things</p>
<p>Happiness is rarely found in a room full of material possessions. While you may feel great when you purchase a new gadget or outfit, you’re much more likely to maintain feelings of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/the-imperfection-of-perfectionism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">satisfaction</a> from social interactions than shopping.</p>
<p>Research studies show that surrounding yourself with others and engaging in more social interactions can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2896234/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">increase your mood</a> and safeguard you against emotional dips.</p>
<p>Plus, what are the odds that a material object can put a smile on your face or make you laugh the way that your closest loved ones do? Make an effort to detox from a love of possessions and engage in social interactions to experience more joy in your everyday life.</p>
<p>4. Remember What Makes You Thankful</p>
<p>Remember to take the time to express <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/4-mental-health-benefits-of-gratitude-to-keep-in-mind-this-thanksgiving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gratitude</a> every once in a while. When you wake up with the attitude that you have the opportunity to do something, rather than that you <i>have</i> to do something, you&#8217;re in a better position to appreciate your life.</p>
<p>If you’re struggling to think of reasons to be thankful, consider making a list. When you write down a list of what makes you grateful, you’ll <a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/discover/gratitude-lists-how-writing-down-what-youre-thankful-for-transforms-wellbeing-and-how-to-start-799653.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">develop a better sense of control over your life</a>.</p>
<h2>Happiness is Within Your Control</h2>
<p>In the end, happiness isn’t a rare feeling that only a select few can achieve. You can be happy with what you have and who you are right now. Your mental health is important, so it&#8217;s powerful to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/meditation-science-eases-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">train your brain</a> to realize that happiness should be a current reality, not a future goal.</p>
<p>Healthy self-care doesn&#8217;t have a timeline or a limit, which means you can find a sense of happiness in yourself at all times — including this very second.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hollywood loves to depict group therapy a certain way: always held in a large, sunny, open room, like a church or a community center, with a ring of folding chairs. There&#8217;s always coffee. Someone will come in late, and be warmly welcomed — and then immediately lay all of their worries bare.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s what you expect going into your first group therapy session, you might be surprised.</p>
<p><span id="more-11329"></span></p>
<p>The Hollywood version more closely resembles an ultra-glam support group. The reality&#8217;s a little different, but perhaps even more meaningful to those who take part.</p>
<h2>What can I expect?</h2>
<p>Most groups include five to fifteen people, all struggling with similar concerns, like a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/eating-disorders-body-image/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eating disorders</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/01/what-causes-social-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social anxiety</a>, or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/addiction-mental-illness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">substance abuse</a>. Even though (most of the time) everyone will have a similar diagnosis, all group members have differing life experiences — making group therapy a fantastic way to hear new perspectives. It&#8217;s also effective: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4209079/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">studies show</a> that group cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression works extremely well.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll probably have one or two licensed facilitators. (Some studies indicate that <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/11/power.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">groups with two facilitators</a> have improved outcomes.) Their exact license will depend on your state and your group — they may be therapists, social workers, or psychologists. They&#8217;ll be guiding the conversation and encouraging you to talk openly.</p>
<p>Yes, talk openly. To strangers. About your feelings. It can be scary! And that&#8217;s okay — the other participants are probably anxious about speaking, too. But, in order to actualize the amazing benefits of group therapy, you&#8217;ll want to share your story.</p>
<h2>What are the benefits?</h2>
<p>Group therapy is often undertaken in conjunction with individual therapy, because it offers a number of unique benefits that are hard to achieve in a one-on-one session with a therapist. Benefits of group therapy include:</p>
<h3>1. Meeting other people with similar problems</h3>
<p>When you&#8217;re struggling with a mental health condition like <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/happens-brain-ptsd-flashback/">post-traumatic stress disorder</a> (PTSD) or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/what-is-crippling-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major depression</a>, it&#8217;s easy to believe you&#8217;re suffering alone, or that no one else could understand the struggle you&#8217;ve been through. But once you start group therapy, you&#8217;ll quickly find that&#8217;s not accurate.</p>
<p>Yes, you all have unique perspectives and backgrounds — but you&#8217;ll see that, in many ways, you share commonalities. <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/11/power.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">One study</a> by Stanford University&#8217;s Irvin Yalom even found that interacting with peers might help more than one-on-one sessions with a therapist.</p>
<h3>2. Sharing your own struggles in a therapeutic setting</h3>
<p>Verbalizing your feelings <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/06/070622090727.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reduces strong emotions</a> like pain, anger, and sadness. When you&#8217;re surrounded by people struggling with similar problems, expressing your feelings can lead to an outpouring of support. That kind of validation is essential.</p>
<p>When you speak up in group therapy, you&#8217;re learning about yourself. Sometimes, we don&#8217;t know we feel something until we say it out loud. Those self-revelations are one of the reasons talk therapy works so well: we learn about ourselves <i>through</i> verbalizing our issues. And in group therapy, when you&#8217;re surrounded by people with similar challenges, you&#8217;ll get instant support for your new realization.</p>
<h3>3. Learning to relate to strangers</h3>
<p>For people struggling with social anxiety, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depression</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/anger-emotions-run-life/">anger management</a>, or other intersocial or socially related mental illnesses, group therapy can be a godsend. Your facilitators will work hard to create a safe atmosphere — letting you ask other members questions about their experiences and giving you the freedom to share something about yourself that makes you anxious.</p>
<p>Group therapy is also a fantastic time to learn more about how you interact with people. Are you an over-apologizer? Do you cut people off mid-sentence? Or do you hang back from the conversation, terrified that your input is unwanted? Facilitators can help you sort through those emotions in the comfort of a patient and understanding group working toward similar goals.</p>
<h3>4. Finding insight into yourself and your actions</h3>
<p>None of us, unfortunately, can observe our own behavior. You think you&#8217;re exceedingly shy — but others read you as blunt. Or, you&#8217;ve been working really hard on being more personable…but haven&#8217;t realized you&#8217;ve crossed the line into &#8220;annoying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because facilitators work so hard to make group therapy a safe and welcoming spot, you have the rare opportunity to both learn about <i>and</i> improve yourself.</p>
<p>Going to your first <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/09/different-types-therapy-psychotherapy-best/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">group therapy</a> session may feel frightening. But you may find that group of strangers doesn&#8217;t feel lonely at all. In fact, opening up to strangers can help you come to important realizations about yourself and your mental health.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you&#8217;re feeling down in the doldrums, chances are good you&#8217;ll respond one of two ways. You might barricade yourself inside your home, not wanting to speak to anyone. Or you may reach out to friends, unloading your worries on their listening ears. Neither approach is wrong.</p>
<p>Whichever way you naturally gravitate, it may be difficult to understand those who act differently than you do when they’re feeling fragile. If you hunker down, you might be amazed by your boyfriend, who likes to jabber out his anxieties. And talkers might be confused by their best friend, who disappears for weeks when she&#8217;s feeling down.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why you might be inclined to reach out or retreat — and advice on helping others who do the opposite.</p>
<p><span id="more-11202"></span></p>
<h2>Reaching Out</h2>
<p>When a thousand stressors weigh on your brain, sometimes the only way to relieve pressure is by letting off steam. Perhaps you invite your bestie over for Chinese food, a sad movie, and a long cry. Or maybe you rant, unloading all of your worries on your mom. You might even type a long email to a trusted confidante, laying bare all your woes.</p>
<p>Talking through your fragile feelings with a trusted friend or loved one <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/10/what-i-wish-someone-had-told-me-about-how-therapy-actually-works/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">works much like talk therapy</a>. True, you won&#8217;t receive insight from a licensed professional counselor, but discussing your anxieties helps you sort out your true feelings. After weeks in the doldrums, a venting session with a friend may help you realize a nasty interaction with your ex sparked the sadness. You can gain valuable perspective, too: maybe things <i>aren&#8217;t</i> as severe as they appear.</p>
<p>But letting off too much steam isn&#8217;t healthy, either. If your venting comes out as rage, or you’re ruminating obsessively over an idea or choice, your health may be at risk. Heart attack risk increases <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140729-is-it-bad-to-bottle-up-anger" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">threefold</a> if you&#8217;re prone to temper tantrums — so make sure your venting remains constructive. Plus, frequent outbursts may alienate friends and family members, who aren’t trained or obligated to help.</p>
<p>Your best option: <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speak with a qualified therapist</a>, who can identify unhealthy coping mechanisms (like angry ranting) <i>and </i>provide the myriad benefits of talk therapy.</p>
<h3>How to help someone who reaches out</h3>
<p>If your friend is going through a difficult time, offer a shoulder to cry on and an ear to listen. Ignore the temptation <a href="https://depression.org.nz/help-someone/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">to offer advice</a>, listen intently, and pay close attention — now isn&#8217;t the time for multitasking with some Candy Crush. Maybe your pal simply needs to let off steam.</p>
<p>But if you suspect their troubles run deeper, encourage them to seek professional help.</p>
<h2>Retreating</h2>
<p>Hiding out beneath the covers can seem like the only option when you&#8217;re feeling sad. What better way to get over a hump than an <i>America&#8217;s Next Top Model </i>marathon? Besides, every time you step out into society, it feels like taking a risk. Will you cry in public? Will you say yet another dumb thing that amplifies your bad mood? Will you (ugh) see your ex?</p>
<p>In certain situations, wallowing is acceptable — science even says that a period of rumination can help you <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/09/how-to-get-over-a-breakup/">move on after a bad breakup</a>. Give yourself time to heal after something bad happens. There&#8217;s no shame in an extended break from society.</p>
<p>But set a limit on your alone time. Sadness can quickly transform into depression — which can be deadly if left untreated. Depression is the country&#8217;s leading cause of disability, and <a href="http://thenationshealth.aphapublications.org/content/40/4/24" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">affects around 5 to 8 percent</a> of adult Americans every year. If you&#8217;re prone to retreating during times of fragility, know the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/assessments/depression-test/">symptoms of the disease</a>.</p>
<p>The more you fold in on yourself, the more difficult it becomes to reach out for help from a friend or a therapist.</p>
<h3>How to help a retreater</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re worried about a friend who has dropped off the face of the planet, tread carefully. Not everyone is receptive to a suggestion that might might be dealing with a condition like depression. Waiting for them to reach out may be the best strategy — someone who is merely sad or has mild depression symptoms may simply need a few weeks alone.</p>
<p>But if you haven&#8217;t heard from them in a while, consider sending a brief message. Let them know you care and want to talk to them. Don&#8217;t push the issue, but leave an opening for further communication. Once they&#8217;re ready, they&#8217;ll reach out.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one major caveat: if your friend expresses suicidal ideation, make sure to contact a trained professional immediately. The <a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Suicide Prevention Hotline</a> can help guide you through this process.</p>
<h2>No Matter Your Style, There are Solutions</h2>
<p>Whether you deal with your stress by reaching out or retreating, consider addressing your mental health concerns with a therapist, who can teach you coping strategies. With their guidance, you&#8217;ll be feeling cheerier in no time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For most people, a sneeze is just a sneeze. But for hypochondriacs, a sneeze can have much bigger implications, making them fear it’s a sign they have a horrible disease.</p>
<p>Put simply, a hypochondriac is an individual who lives with the fear that they have a serious but undiagnosed medical condition — even when diagnostic tests from professionals show there is nothing wrong.</p>
<p><span id="more-11066"></span></p>
<h2>Hypochondria Defined</h2>
<p>Hypochondria (also known as hypochondriasis) is commonly referred to as illness anxiety disorder (IAD). Diagnosis of IAD is confirmed when fears and symptoms persist for longer than six months despite a thorough medical evaluation and reassurance there are no medical issues present. This chronic anxiety-related disorder often presents similarly to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/ocd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">obsessive-compulsive disorder</a>. And, like other <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/different-types-anxiety-disorders-classified/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety disorders</a>, hypochondria has the potential to interfere with a person’s quality of life.</p>
<h2>Hypochondria: A Somatoform Disorder</h2>
<p>Hypochondria falls under the broader category of somatoform disorders. This is a term used for psychiatric disorders that cause unexplained physical symptoms.</p>
<p>The extreme anxiety associated with hypochondria can manifest as bodily sensations — such as muscle twitching or fatigue — which, to a hypochondriac, are associated with a specific physical illness, despite the body being healthy. In this scenario, the disorder is not about the presence or absence of illness, but the psychological reaction to a specific form of anxiety.</p>
<p>Other somatoform disorders include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Somatization disorder</li>
<li>Undifferentiated somatoform disorder</li>
<li>Conversion disorder</li>
<li>Pain disorder</li>
<li>Body dysmorphic disorder</li>
<li>Somatoform disorder not otherwise specified</li>
</ul>
<p>Undiagnosed symptoms of somatoform disorders often lead to inaccurate or exaggerated beliefs about somatic symptoms, difficult encounters with medical professionals (frequent visits, unnecessary lab tests), and resistance to or noncompliance with diagnostic or treatment efforts.</p>
<h2>Hypochondriac Symptoms</h2>
<p>Broadly, hypochondria involves preoccupation with the idea that you’re seriously ill based on normal body sensations (a rumbling stomach) or minor signs (a scratchy voice). More specifically, signs and symptoms may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extreme worry over having or getting a serious illness.</li>
<li>Worry persisting despite appropriate medical evaluation and reassurance.</li>
<li>The duration of the disturbance lasting at least six months.</li>
<li>Physical symptoms are not present or if present, only mild. If another illness is present, or there is a risk for developing a physical illness, a hypochondriac’s concern is out of proportion.</li>
<li>High level of anxiety and alarm over personal health status.</li>
<li>Repetitive checking of the body for symptoms of an alleged medical condition.</li>
<li>Excessive health-related behaviors — repeatedly checking body temperature, researching symptoms and checking body for signs of illness — or abnormal avoidance — avoiding scheduled doctors’ appointments or the need to make them, and hospitals.</li>
<li>Multiple medical tests, often for the same alleged condition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Diagnosis of hypochondria usually starts with a primary care physician expressing concern about a patient and recommending they consult a psychiatrist or other <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/mental-health-counselor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health professional</a>. Patients, however, sometimes refuse to see a mental health clinician, or express wariness, as if continue to suspect something is physically wrong.</p>
<h2>Hypochondriac Treatment</h2>
<p>Fortunately, several treatment options are available for people with hypochondria and other forms of health anxiety. Because of their many similarities, the same techniques that are effective in treating OCD are also employed in the treatment of hypochondria. Below are two examples that are available to hypochondriacs that should be researched further, with the help of professionals, before proceeding.</p>
<h3>Psychotherapy for Hypochondria</h3>
<p>Hypochondria is a psychological problem, even if legitimate physical symptoms exist. Because of this, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">psychotherapy</a> in a number of forms — cognitive therapy, behavior therapy, or stress management — can be beneficial.</p>
<h3>Medication Options for Hypochondriacs</h3>
<p>The symptoms of hypochondriasis may sometimes be relieved by an <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/am-i-going-to-be-on-meds-forever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">antidepressant</a>. Experts have noticed this disorder’s similarity to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and have thus found that it can help to prescribe OCD treatments — serotonin specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).</p>
<p>It should be noted that some individuals with hypochondria do not consider these options because they do not believe they have a mental health disorder or maintain that their challenges are of a physical nature.</p>
<h2>Changing the Narrative Around Hypochondria</h2>
<p>According to the OCD Center of Los Angeles, <a href="https://ocdla.com/hypochondriasis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">4-6 percent of the population has clinically significant hypochondria</a>. Furthermore, they suggest that up to 10 percent of all visits to primary care physicians may be due to hypochondriacal fears.</p>
<p>Like many other mental health issues, hypochondria is a condition that is often tossed around lightly in conversation or used pejoratively. Someone might seem worried over a headache and be called a “hypochondriac” in a casual group setting. It’s important to remember, however, that this pejorative term can undermine the potential severity of anxiety.</p>
<p>Hypochondria is a real and entirely treatable disorder. If you recognize any of the symptoms listed above, help is available to you. Consider <a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/online-therapy-with-a-licensed-therapist?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_POST_INLINE&amp;utr_adgroup=inline-link-cta&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/10/what-is-hypochondria-how-to-get-help&amp;var=promo-b&amp;partner=Talkspace%20Blog&amp;code=BLOG45">speaking with a therapist</a> to help work through these medically-based anxieties.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’re having a conversation at a party. It sounds normal enough, but something doesn’t feel right, although you can’t quite put your finger on what. You recognize that your friend is telling you something without telling you something — “I normally don’t like the way you dress, but that dress looks great on you!” she says.</p>
<p><i>Ouch</i>. It hits you: She’s being passive aggressive.</p>
<p>Passive-aggressive behavior is a way of expressing anger in a seemingly non-hostile way — a deliberate and masked way of expressing covert feelings. It’s a behavior that encompasses more than just eye rolls and faux compliments; it involves a range of actions designed to get back at another person without him or her recognizing the underlying anger.</p>
<p><span id="more-10678"></span></p>
<h2>What Makes People Passive Aggressive?</h2>
<p>Passive-aggressive behavior, while expressed in many different ways (sarcasm, the silent treatment, running late, to name a few), has the same roots: There is an underlying fear and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/identifying-avoidant-partner-improve-relationship/" target="_blank">avoidance</a> of direct conflict, yet a feeling of powerlessness and helplessness.</p>
<p>There can be a number of reasons for the cause of the behavior. One is from a fear of anger. Most of us learn when growing up that it is bad to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/why-feeling-anger-is-good-for-you/" target="_blank">express anger</a> inappropriately. The passive aggressive person has learned that expressing anger in any way is bad and that he or she is bad for feeling anger.</p>
<p>Another reason is based on upbringing. Children who are raised by overly controlling parents, in an environment where self-expression is not permitted, are forced to learn other ways to express feelings of anger and hostility. Since they are dependent upon their parents, they risk punishment if they don’t do as their parents say. Therefore, they lash out at their parents covertly and maintain that behavior into adulthood.</p>
<p>There are many other biological and environmental factors that can contribute to the development of passive aggressive behavior. A few of these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</li>
<li><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/stress/">Stress</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/different-types-anxiety-disorders-classified/">Anxiety disorders</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/">Depression</a></li>
<li>Bipolar disorder</li>
<li>Schizophrenia</li>
<li>Alcohol abuse</li>
<li>Drug withdrawal</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Stop Your Passive Aggressive Behavior</h2>
<p>Whether you find yourself in a relationship with someone who displays their anger in a passive-aggressive manner, or you recognize such behavior patterns within yourself, consider eliminating this communication style in order to relate to others in a healthier, more effective way.</p>
<p>Learn to recognize the behavior, check your perceptions, confront it, and create a safe space to communicate in more assertive ways.</p>
<h3>1. Recognize your behavior</h3>
<p>The best way to nip passive aggressive behavior in the bud is to become aware of when you’re reacting in a passive aggressive way.</p>
<h3>2. Understand why your behavior should be changed</h3>
<p>It’s important to realize that passive-aggression is <i>not</i> less aggressive simply because it’s passive. Essentially, passive-aggression is an indirect form of aggression — not necessarily a milder form of aggression.</p>
<h3>3. Give yourself time</h3>
<p>Recognizing your own behaviors and understanding them is a good first step toward change, but altering your patterns and reactions can take some time.</p>
<h3>4. Realize it’s OK to be angry</h3>
<p>You can still be a positive person and feel emotions we typically label as negative. And you can be a loving friend, girlfriend, boyfriend, wife, husband, mother, father, son, or daughter while feeling anger in response to something the other person has done.</p>
<h3>5. Be assertive, not aggressive</h3>
<p>State facts clearly and be clear about your opinions. Let the person know the impact of her behavior in clear statements.</p>
<h3>6. Be open to confrontation</h3>
<p>While directing expressing your needs can lead to potential confrontation, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Keep in mind that confrontation can be direct and respectful — even if positivity isn’t the first thing that comes to mind when you think of it.</p>
<h3>Believe in Yourself</h3>
<p>Avoiding the slide into passive aggressiveness requires closing the gap between anger and silence — either by dissipating anger or breaking the silence. The more you believe that you have the right to express your wants and needs, the less likely you are to fear being swayed by others’ opinions or rejected for voicing what you want. And the less you fear those things, the more direct you’re likely to be.</p>
<p>It’s a long, often difficult journey, but as a first step, practice listening to what you want and giving it to yourself. If you begin to treat your desires as important and valid and experience how good that feels, you’ll start to believe that you deserve similar treatment from other people.<br />
