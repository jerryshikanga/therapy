				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The summer brings many reasons to rejoice — warmer weather, vacations, road trips, barbecuing, and usually a little extra time with loved ones. Yet for some of us, no other season brings such apprehension, especially at the mention of “bathing suit.”</p>
<p><span id="more-10311"></span></p>
<p>“As a plus-size black woman, summer time always made me nervous,” blogger/content creator Christian Simone said. “Being someone who developed early, wearing shorts and a tank that looks so comfy was always a struggle&#8230;As an adult, I feel like a magnifying glass is over me when I opt to wear things like a bikini or shorts.”</p>
<p>“I was the girl who ‘got fat’ when I went away to college and my body anxiety was at an all-time high,” Jaclyn DiGregorio, founder of the digital wellness community <a href="https://www.cuspit.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuspit</a>, said. “I would go into the dressing room with a few bikinis and stare at my fat and ugly body, telling myself that I really needed to step it up and eat less to lose weight before summer began.”</p>
<h2>What Is Body Anxiety</h2>
<p>It’s normal to feel self-conscious about how we look, especially as we peel off extra layers of clothing during the hot summer months. But <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/12/what-body-dysmorphia-actually-feels-like/" target="_blank">body anxiety</a> can also be debilitating.</p>
<p>“I feel I am missing out on my most festive summer nights because I don’t feel comfortable,” says Christian Simone. “People who don’t deal with body issues can’t understand the intensity of someone who has been cat-called or told to sit the summer out as there is no place for hippos.”</p>
<p>While some people “can continue with &#8216;normal&#8217; activities,” according to Dr. Ariane Machin, a clinical psychologist and co-founder of the <a href="http://www.drarianemachin.com/coachingcollective/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conscious Coaching Collective</a>, they may “be very distracted by thoughts related to their body size/shape, perceptions that they are typically much larger than they are in reality, or constantly comparing themselves to those around them.”</p>
<p>Sometimes a little reassurance from loved ones, and traveling with people who make us feel loved and comfortable, is enough to keep the worry at bay — even on the beach or poolside. At other times, body anxiety is tied to deeper issues.</p>
<p>“[Others] may begin to isolate and/or reduce the activities that they are involved in,” Machin said. “Someone who once loved to do group workouts now feels too self-conscious and isolates, which in turn may enhance feelings of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a> and anxiety.”</p>
<h2>When To Seek Help</h2>
<p>Body anxiety at the stronger end of the spectrum may lead to low self-esteem, other mental health issues, and eating disorders. Those who have also experienced trauma will likely have a complicated relationship with their body.</p>
<p>“Sometimes the anxiety has nothing to do with the body at all,” Philadelphia-based licensed psychologist <a href="http://www.hptherapy.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Robin Hornstein</a> said. “It [could] be some trauma that happened [or] you&#8217;re waiting for test results from a medical test, and you&#8217;re scared, and so it&#8217;s so much easier to fight a part of your body at that moment then to just say, ‘Damn, I&#8217;m grieving,’ or, ‘I&#8217;m scared,’ or, ‘I don&#8217;t know how to handle this stress for too long.’&#8221;</p>
<p>If body anxiety starts to take over by exhibiting symptoms such as not eating right, poor sleep, isolation, avoidance of previously enjoyed activities, or trouble keeping up with obligations like work, it may be time to reach out to a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/mental-health-counselor/" target="_blank">mental health professional</a>.</p>
<p>“If you can&#8217;t do it on your own, reach out to somebody else,” Hornstein advised. “Whether that&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a>, or whether that&#8217;s somebody you trust — a mentor, a family member, a friend, a partner, a spouse — and say, ‘Hey, help.’”</p>
<h2>Ways To Combat Body Anxiety</h2>
<p>In the meantime, we have a few ideas to help reduce body anxiety as we head into the dog days of summer.</p>
<h3>1. Reduce Media Consumption</h3>
<p>Hornstein asks clients to reduce the amount of media they consume. These unrealistic portrayals of bodies and beauty aren’t realistic (and are often a work of camera and editing magic). In addition, Hornstein helps clients identify favorite activities, like swimming, they no longer enjoy due to anxiety about their body and figure out how to work those back into their life.</p>
<h3>2. Reframe How Your View Your Body</h3>
<p>Teaching clients to reframe how they view their body is one of the first steps Machin takes, by using mantras such as, “My body is an instrument, not an ornament.” From there, Machin finds clients regain their power and confidence through body movement by taking up walking, yoga, weight lifting, or any other activity that “brings you <i>joy</i> in moving your body and reaffirms that your body is strong.”</p>
<h3>3. Focus On The Positives of Summer Skin</h3>
<p>New York-based clinical psychologist <a href="http://www.comprehendthemind.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dr. Sanam Hafeez</a> suggests refocusing our energy on the benefits of showing more skin, a cognitive shift that can help mitigate the impact of anxiety. She recommends asking questions such as, “How would it feel to savor the sensation of warm sun on my skin?” or “How might swimming help me relax or exercise more?” Take this a step further, she said, and try: “What three things can I appreciate about my body right now?”</p>
<h2>How Others Empower Themselves</h2>
<p>In addition to these practical strategies, find creative ways to reduce body anxiety that work for you. Sometimes these pursuits are the most empowering.</p>
<h3>Start a Blog or Journal to Tell Your Story</h3>
<p>For example, Christian Simone took hold of her anxiety by creating a body positivity blog, <a href="http://thechristiansimone.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Christian Simone</a>, where she posts about her journey to health and acceptance.</p>
<p>“Last year I created a post that showcased me in a bikini. I did this again this year because I feel if I own who and what I am then I can move forward,” Simone said. “I still have moments of anxiety but I just tell myself that these moments are temporary and who cares if someone doesn’t like it? What has been more important is to allow myself the mental flow to accept me at my size and to not stop living because of anxiety.”</p>
<h3>Create Clothes That Fit Your Unique Style and Body</h3>
<p>Erin Weisbart, owner of the sewing and pattern company <a href="https://tuesdaystitches.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tuesday Stitches</a>, uses another creative outlet to overcome body anxiety — sewing. Weisbart encourages others to bring clothing to life that flatters their favorite features through customizable patterns. By sewing her own clothing, she’s found a path to confidence, and she shares that message with others through her company.</p>
<p>“I sew pretty much all my own clothes at this point,” Weisbart said. “Sewing empowers people to love their bodies because you learn that with any sewing pattern, you&#8217;re going to make changes to it to fit your body perfectly.…If you learn to sew your own clothes, then you can learn to embrace, accept, and celebrate your unique body.”</p>
<h2>Above All, Self-Love is a Key Component</h2>
<p>Regardless of the journey, with self-love and support from loved ones and a therapist as needed, self-acceptance can replace body anxiety.</p>
<p>“I loved the stretch marks on my legs because they signified the transition from child body to adult body,” Jaclyn DiGregorio said, on where she is now, “No one has the perfect body, but turning your imperfections into gratitude for the many blessings in your life can truly make a huge difference in finding body positivity in a world of body anxiety.”</p>
<p>This summer, we’ll leave you with these final bits of advice:</p>
<p>“A beach body is a body that puts on a bathing suit and goes to the beach,” Robin Hornstein said.</p>
<p>Christian Simone tells it more frankly. “Wear whatever you fucking want and live your most festive life!”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Often, it feels like every time we turn around, there&#8217;s a new diet fad, exercise craze, or best-selling book proclaiming itself to be the key to health.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as Western society increasingly prioritizes clean eating, physical exercise, and other forms of &#8220;healthy living,&#8221; clinicians have seen another trend: orthorexia.</p>
<p>A relatively new term, orthorexia is still taking shape as a concept, and is not yet mentioned in the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em>. <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs40519-017-0417-6.pdf" target="_blank">The original definition by doctor Steven Bratman and writer David Knight </a>described orthorexia as an obsession with proper nutrition, dietary restrictions, and specific food preparation methods.</p>
<p><span id="more-9261"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/qhw.v10.26799" target="_blank">Other research suggests</a> we should include preoccupation with exercise as a component of the definition as well. In short: we’re still trying to figure out exactly what it means. Not only does orthorexia overlap other disorders, but it’s also hard to tell when a specific diet becomes a problem.</p>
<h2>Orthorexia, Anorexia, and Anxiety</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25733839" target="_blank">According to authors Nancy S. Koven and Alexandra W. Abry</a>, orthorexia appears to mimic other disorders such as anorexia (an eating disorder) and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/09/struggle-ocd-quieting-minds-commands/" target="_blank">obsessive-compulsive disorder (or OCD, an anxiety disorder)</a>. Like anorexia and OCD, individuals with orthorexia have a few traits in common: perfectionistic tendencies, an anxious outlook, and difficulty being flexible in how they see the world.</p>
<p>On the other hand, orthorexia has some distinct differences. What sets it apart from anxiety and OCD?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Orthorexia is more specific. </strong>First, in orthorexia, we see greater emphasis on food quality, along with unrealistic beliefs about food and an overall desire to maximize health.</li>
<li><strong>Orthorexia is not often a secret. </strong>In addition, people with anorexia and OCD tend to be secretive about their behaviors and symptoms, fearing other people will judge them or try to intervene. In contrast, people with orthorexia appear to flaunt their healthy choices, making their beliefs and habits well-known to those around them. They’re excited about their healthy lifestyle.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although clinicians now understand more about orthorexia as a unique problem, distinct from disorders with similar symptoms, we still have no official diagnostic criteria. <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0135772" target="_blank">Scant research and flawed measures</a> make diagnosis tricky.</p>
<h2>Diet or Disorder?</h2>
<p>Even the man who coined the term orthorexia carefully distinguishes between a strict diet and a clinical disorder. In fact, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40519-017-0417-6" target="_blank">Bratman recently clarified his thoughts</a> about it, pointing out that a healthy diet isn&#8217;t a problem unless it intensifies into an obsession.</p>
<p>While he and other researchers are still working on exact diagnostic criteria, we have to do the best we can with what we’ve learned so far. Just because a person adheres to a strict or unusual diet doesn&#8217;t mean they have a disorder.</p>
<p>Fortunately, clinicians are accustomed to working in gray areas. Most only worry about a behavior when it becomes severe enough to disrupt daily life. In my practice, for example, I&#8217;m most interested in how well my clients are functioning. I can still help people who want to change problem behaviors, even if those behaviors don&#8217;t exactly fit a diagnostic pigeonhole.</p>
<p>For Bratman, the patients who raised concern were those whose “exuberant pursuit of physical health had spawned a rigid, fearful, and self-punishing lifestyle that caused more harm than good.” Using this mindset, along with the general diagnostic framework&#8217;s researchers propose, we can recognize signs of possible orthorexia.</p>
<h2>Warning Signs</h2>
<p>When considering the following warning signs, remember we’re looking at an overall pattern of behavior that gets in the way of daily life, not just one or two habits or beliefs. These clues suggest a person may have taken a healthy lifestyle to an unhealthy extreme:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Excessive time spent thinking about, planning, and preparing food</strong>. Likely, the time spent doing these things limits time available for other activities.</li>
<li><strong>Anxiety regarding health, types of foods, or food contamination</strong>. Severe food-related anxiety and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/how-perfectionism-hurts-your-relationships/" target="_blank">perfectionism makes it hard to be flexible about food — in social settings</a> and otherwise.</li>
<li><strong>&#8220;Healthy habits&#8221; begin to interfere with social life</strong>. People avoid social situations because unpredictable settings might keep them from meeting their strict food standards.</li>
<li><strong>Excessive exercise</strong>. A person works out too long, too hard, or too often.</li>
<li><strong>Significant weight loss or negative changes in health</strong>. Rigid eating habits persist even when the person’s health suffers.</li>
<li><strong>Excessive focus on moral implications of food choices</strong>. The person worries more about what a food choice means for their moral standing than whether that choice actually supports health.</li>
<li><strong>Excessive focus on body image</strong>. Anxiety about appearance or unrealistic opinions of body image remain, despite evidence to the contrary.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Help</h2>
<p>If you or loved one has signs of disordered eating or exercise, there are good treatment options. Because eating disorders affect both physical and mental health, they must be treated using a whole-person approach.</p>
<p>Although working with multiple providers can be overwhelming, each person plays an important role in recovery. This team effort includes mental health, medical, and nutrition professionals, each of which brings unique expertise.</p>
<p>Physicians will assess and monitor your physical health, recommending a pace of change that is healthy for you. A nutritionist can teach you about required nutrition, identify food misconceptions, and plan a recovery diet that meets your nutritional needs. Finally, a mental health professional can use <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-how-is-it-conducted-online/" target="_blank">cognitive behavioral therapy</a> and behavior modification to change unhealthy thoughts and habits into more functional ways of thinking and behaving.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re still working to pin down orthorexia&#8217;s specifics, but we can help when healthy habits go awry. By consulting with specialists trained in eating disorders, you can have a truly healthy lifestyle.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The spread is incredible — juicy dark meat turkey, homemade stuffing, mashed potatoes, those brussel sprouts my brother prepares that make them actually taste delicious, candied sweet potatoes — and we haven’t even gotten to dessert, my favorite part of every meal, especially when seasonal pies are involved.</p>
<p>My eyes feast on the meal, but inside my anxiety starts to edge its way into my mind. How much can I put on my plate this Thanksgiving and still feel like I won’t be judged for how much or what I am eating? Can I afford to eat two slices of pie, or do I need to stick with just one to keep up appearances? Am I making enough of a show of restraint in comparison to my BMI for the extended family members at the table so I won’t feel judged?<span id="more-8439"></span></p>
<p>If you take one look at me, it’s not going to be a secret that I eat a lot of food, and unhealthy food at that. I have an uncomfortable relationship with my body, not the least of which is my anxiety around how others perceive what I look like, which is overweight. I try to joke about it — rebranding french fries as “health potatoes” to make everyone laugh instead of watch me eat more unhealthy food I don’t need — but nothing other than practicing extreme restraint around others eases the anxiety about how my body is perceived, especially when I am eating.</p>
<p>In the end I stick with a moderate plate of food, skip seconds on the stuffing, and have only one piece of pie, even though the national food indulgence holiday could serve as an excuse to eat a little extra. But in front of other people, the anxiety about what I consume is too great to override my fear about what my body looks like and what I imagine people think when they see a fat girl eating too much food.</p>
<h2>Anxiety Around Social Eating</h2>
<p>It turns out anxiety around eating and body issues is not uncommon, for people of all shapes and sizes. Much of it can be linked to social anxiety disorder. According to the psychology diagnosis bible, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, social phobia is marked by a fear or anxiety in social situations where you are “exposed to possible scrutiny by others,” including being observed while eating or drinking. This can make eating in social situations very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Concerns about what others are thinking can fuel anxiety and make it very difficult to eat,” <a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/blog/dear-lesley-why-so-difficult-to-eat-public" target="_blank">writes</a> Lesley Williams, MD. “My patients who struggle with eating in front of others describe physical symptoms of anxiety such as a fast heart rate, sweaty palms, a sensation of a lump in their throat, nausea, and stomach pain.”</p>
<p>The chief cause of anxiety comes directly from the fear of how others perceive you. This can result from past bad experiences around your body and food, whether that’s because someone commented on how much you ate, what you ate, or what your body looked like. This breeds a sense of self-consciousness and low self-esteem around one’s body that can easily turn into full-blown anxiety in future outings where food is involved.</p>
<p>“It may be that there has been a direct incident in the person’s past where they have had a negative experience of eating in front of others, [whether it’s] being told that they eat in an antisocial manner, [or one bad] comment or an event,” <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2017/06/14/the-deeper-meanings-behind-your-fear-of-eating-in-front-of-your-partner-6708236/" target="_blank">said</a> Click For Therapy’s Rebecca McCann. “It may also be linked with low self esteem, a feeling of not being good enough that adds to feelings of anxiety.”</p>
<h2>Anxiety and Disordered Eating</h2>
<p>The relationship between eating, anxiety, and body issues can be even more complex than social anxiety disorder. Anxiety around food, and the fear of how others view you, can lead to disordered eating.</p>
<p>“Having a difficult time eating in front of others can also be a warning sign of developing an eating disorder in the future,” writes Williams.</p>
<p>A 2012 eating behaviors <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22177392" target="_blank">study</a> on the correlation between social anxiety and eating disorders, for example, found that the fear of being viewed poorly in social situations, especially while eating, predicted “body dissatisfaction, bulimic symptoms, shape concern, weight concern, and eating concern.” A “fear of negative evaluation” often led directly to a desire for thinness and restraint around eating. This makes eating and body image perception even more complicated, especially with other people around.</p>
<p>“It takes a great deal of mental energy to quiet the constant eating disorder voices that are saying things like, ‘You shouldn’t eat that,’ ‘That has too many calories,’” said Williams. And this is where things get really difficult. “Those eating disorder voices get even louder when you add worries regarding about how others are perceiving you.”</p>
<h2>Eating to Ease Anxiety</h2>
<p>On another side of the equation, eating can be used as a way to relieve anxiety, feeding into a vicious cycle between food issues and body image discomfort.</p>
<p>“Anxiety symptoms and disorders frequently co-occur with overeating,” <a href="https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/treatment-for-eating-disorders/co-occurring-dual-diagnosis/anxiety/anxiety-overeating-whats-the-overlap" target="_blank">writes</a> psychologist Jennifer Pells. “The hoped-for effect of this coping strategy may be to suppress, numb, distract, soothe, avoid, or mask the original anxiety.”</p>
<p>Overeating to soothe anxiety can happen for a number of reasons. Food can be used as an escape from self-awareness, and therefore hard feelings, because of the concentration on an alternative, yet immediate stimuli: food.</p>
<p>Food also works as an emotional regulation tool through binging, though often this can make people feel depressed, guilty, or shameful afterward. However, these negative emotions serve as a “trade-off” to minimize the heightened discomfort of an anxiety response, creating a complicated relationship between eating and how we view our body after overindulging.</p>
<h2>Help for Food Anxiety</h2>
<p>Taken together, if anxiety around food and body image are taking their toll, know you are not alone. Reach out for support from trusted loved ones or your therapist if you’re feeling anxious about eating or struggling with your body image. At the end of the day, we all deserve to feel good in our body no matter our shape, and eat in a way that nourishes our body, mind, and soul, whatever that means for each of us.</p>
<p>“There is one golden rule to normal eating, and it is this,” <a href="http://www.fatnutritionist.com/index.php/how-to-eat-in-a-nutshell-lesson-one/" target="_blank">writes</a> registered dietitian Michelle Allison. “No one decides what or how much goes in your mouth but you.”</p>
<p>And remember: there’s no wrong way to have a body.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine what life would be like if we stood in front of the mirror and focused on what we love about ourselves instead of what we wish we could change?</p>
<p>It seems instead that a majority of us veer toward thinking negatively, giving attention to our so-called flaws. We are bombarded with images of beautiful celebrities and models on television, in magazines, and on billboards. Even our own cell phones — Instagram, I’m looking at you — can be culprits, inundating us with photographs of people who have likely slapped on a filter and Facetuned themselves to “perfection.” What’s the result? A never ending supply of edited images and a load of viewers feeling inadequate and uncomfortable in their own skin.</p>
<p>All of this leads to unrealistic expectations of what we should look like, dress like, and act like. As technology advances and we’re more connected than ever, it seems that self esteem — especially of millennials — declines. <a href="http://time.com/4459153/social-media-body-image/" target="_blank">Recent studies</a> show a definite link between social media usage and low self esteem. It’s way too easy to fall down a rabbit hole on Facebook or Instagram. You can be on your feed and next thing you know you’re on your ex-boyfriend’s sister’s best friend’s page wishing you had abs as great as hers.<span id="more-6807"></span></p>
<p>Despite what we may believe, nobody’s perfect! Women and men in magazines are groomed, and photoshopped to match society’s preference. And let’s not forget that the “ideal body” <a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/2016/05/ideal-body-types-throughout-history/" target="_blank">changes constantly with the trends</a>. Think about it. In the ‘90s, Kate Moss was the archetype of the “perfect woman” — fairy looking features and an extremely skinny figure. Did anyone think heroin-chic was healthy? Now, the tables have turned to favor “thick” women with generous curves, a la the Kardashian family. Following beauty fads can be exhausting and dangerous.</p>
<p>Comparing ourselves to others is the root of all evil when it comes to negative body image. Every single one of us is beautiful in our own way, and yet we are always looking at others and coveting something that they have and we don’t — or think we don’t have. We look at ourselves and think that we aren’t good enough the way we are. Why is it so hard to just accept ourselves?</p>
<p>On top of this, many of us have internalized negative comments from our past that we’re unable to shake. We’re more likely to remember one cynical comment from a peer than we are to remember all of the compliments from friends. For example, I’ll always remember meeting an cosmetic dentist at a club who told me that he’d love to “fix” my crooked front tooth.</p>
<p>The effect of poor body image can be dangerous. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-squeaky-wheel/201411/why-teens-low-self-esteem-become-depressed-adults" target="_blank">Studies show</a> that teenagers with low self esteem are at a higher risk to develop depression in young adulthood. Low self esteem is also <a href="https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/treatment-for-eating-disorders/co-occurring-dual-diagnosis/anxiety/body-image-and-social-anxiety" target="_blank">linked with other mental health problems</a> like obsessive compulsive disorder, social anxiety, eating disorders, and body dysmorphic disorder.</p>
<p>Positive body image doesn’t mean you have to stare at your naked body in the mirror for five minutes after you shower admiring each part of yourself — but if you do, more power to you! It doesn’t mean that you have to be obsessed with every part of yourself, rather, you should reach a point where you accept your appearance as it is. It’s not about perfection.</p>
<p>Building your self esteem takes work. If you have very poor body image, it can take years to repair. Why not start now? There are so many things you can do to build yourself up and undo a lifetime of low self esteem. Here are a few suggestions to get you started.</p>
<h2>1. Recognize That Nobody’s Perfect</h2>
<p>No one is 100% flawless. Know that perfection is more of an idea than a reality.<br />
Aiming for perfection will only let you down. When you’re looking at magazines or Instagram, take everything with a grain of salt. Remember that almost every image you see is edited.</p>
<h2>2. Appreciate Your Own Beauty</h2>
<p>Take note of everything you like about yourself. Make a list, and physically write it down. When you’re feeling bad about yourself, revisit the list to remind yourself of all your positive attributes. As your self esteem improves, you may find even more parts of yourself that you love. Add them to the list!</p>
<h2>3. Don’t Rely on Others for Confidence Boosts</h2>
<p>Allow yourself to accept compliments from people, but don’t let this be your main source of confidence. Ultimately, confidence is going to come from within you. Sure, it’s nice to have reassurance from others that you look good, but you want to look and feel good from within.</p>
<h2>4. Take Care of Yourself</h2>
<p>Exercise regularly and eat healthily. Working out and setting goals can help you feel great both physically and mentally. A balanced diet is key, as well. That being said, you shouldn’t compulsively over-exercise or obsessively count calories. It’s tough to balance, but try to focus on the internal benefits of a healthy lifestyle rather than the external ones.</p>
<h2>5. Avoid Being Preoccupied by Social Media</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, social media use is linked to low self esteem. Try not to get too caught up in it. Make a conscious effort to go on your social media apps less. If you’re feeling extra down about yourself, it might be a good idea to delete the apps from your phone for a couple of days for a social media cleanse.</p>
<p>Do I wish my lips were more pillowy and my snaggle tooth was in line with the rest of my teeth? Sure. But as I said before, it’s not about perfection — it’s about acceptance. After following those aforementioned steps, I learned to love myself, and in turn, developed a better body image than I’ve ever had before. There’s no reason why you can’t too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><em>This piece is part of our <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/tag/darkest-day/" target="_blank">Darkest Day series</a>, a collection of stories from people who’ve made it through the worst of their illness and now light the way for others.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em>It’s 7am and I’ve already burned 1,000 calories on the elliptical. I’m packing up my food for the day. Breakfast is 113 calories for 3 egg whites and 1 cup of grapes. Lunch will be 131 calories for turkey, mustard, lettuce, and baby carrots. I’ve also packed 1 pack of Parliament Lights, 4 Diet Cokes, 1 gallon of water, and 1 brand new pack of bubblemint gum. I’ll have dance class in the afternoon, which takes care of another 300 or so calories. Dinner is always a wild card –– it depends on who’s around and how carefully I’m being watched. I have food saved in my room for later just in case. I am 16 years old and 70 pounds; I am a human calorie counter and numbers genius who, ironically, is also struggling in Pre-Calculus.</em></p>
<p>Looking back, it’s hard to pinpoint a clear start for all of this. Unlike an alcoholic who can often describe their first drink, there was no concrete “first.” My eating disorder was a physical manifestation of a longtime underlying condition. It was some combination of perfectionism, extreme sensitivity, fear, and ironically enough a hunger –– a hunger for love, acceptance, validation. A hunger for everything. That hunger felt unmanageable so instead of learning how to experience it, I taught myself how to stop it, to cut it off, to starve it out. If you don’t want anything, you can never get hurt, right?<span id="more-6413"></span></p>
<p>Aside from a cracked internal landscape, there were plenty of external circumstances that fed my food obsession. I lived on the westside of Los Angeles –– a part of town that’s known for lavish living, celebrities, plastic surgery, and an impossible standard of beauty. It’s a town that’s flanked with billboards about freezing off your fat, entire stores dedicated to “diet” food, hypnotists ready to convince you that you will no longer be hungry by the time you reopen your eyes, and people jumping to tell you how amazing you look the skinnier you are (while secretly hating you). That can dent the psyche of even the strongest mental warrior, but when you’re a teenager and confused about everything and desperately looking for anything that makes sense –– LA is not your friend, it’s a fucking toxic playground.</p>
<p>My days were marked by careful planning, rigid scheduling, and predictable manufactured moments. Anything beyond &#8220;the plan&#8221; threw me for a loop and I couldn’t deal. I&#8217;d weigh myself, decide whether it was a good or bad day based on what the scale said, plan my food, go to school, see a doctor or a nutritionist, lie to said doctor or nutritionist, go home, lie about what I ate all day, give some bullshit about how the doctor said I was &#8220;making progress,&#8221; concoct a way out of dinner then disappear into my room. It was a sad, small existence, but it was how I managed.</p>
<p>Lots of anorexics experience trauma earlier in life that leads them to a place of craving this level of control. I didn&#8217;t have that. I was just a deeply sensitive person who felt a lot and didn&#8217;t know what to do with those feelings. I carried on in this way for years. My parents were freaked out and had no idea what to do with me. My mom would often tell me that I looked like an AIDS patient and wondered if it was drugs that were doing this.</p>
<p>With my rolodex of doctors and specialists increasing by the week, my main psychiatrist was pushing for inpatient treatment. I, of course, had a million reasons why that was unnecessary and in true anorexic fashion, was always able to manipulate my parents to agree with me. The question of college came up. I had gotten into a top east coast university. My doctors strongly recommended that I stay back and take a gap year to get my health in order. By this time, my physical state was at its worst. It was getting harder for me to physically do simple tasks. Once the body burns through fat, it feeds on muscles…like the heart. For the first time I agreed with my doctors, but I was too frightened to speak up. So when my parents said maybe a change of scenery would make all of this better, I believed them.</p>
<p><em>On Tuesdays I meet with Mary, the Beverly Hills nutritionist who has me writing down everything I eat. I quickly fill in my food logs, lying as I add in handfuls of almonds and tablespoons of peanut butter (two things that will thrill her). I promised everyone I would focus on getting my weight up before I take off for school. I weigh myself before the appointment. I’ve lost 3 more pounds. The sick part of the mind is overjoyed, but the rational side panics and I get an instant stomach ache. I am so screwed. I quickly run downstairs where my mom stores all of our exercise equipment and grab a few small weights. I stash them in my bag as I head off to the appointment. I always wear a hospital gown during my weigh ins so they can get an “accurate” read which makes it easy to hide the weights under my arms. Mary is so kind and I can tell she genuinely wants to help, but she’s a little oblivious and doesn’t think to check for anything that could tip the scale. I step on, and breathe a quick sigh of relief as she congratulates me on the weight gain. I know it’s a lie, so why am I so upset to see the number increase?</em></p>
<p>One day, I walked in the front the door and my mom was waiting for me in the kitchen. I’ll never forget the look of horror that was flashing across her face. She told me that Jackie, my high school guidance counselor had called to tell my mom that I had been hiding weights under my arms. Jackie was one of the few people I trusted during this time. She would pull me out of classes to hang out in her office and talk and sometimes she would let me smoke cigarettes out in the alley. I told her most of my secrets but instantly regretted sharing this one. The discovery of this lie was the final straw. I had officially frayed everyone’s last nerve.</p>
<p>Fall rolled around and I took off for the east coast. I was committed to changing my ways and starting fresh in a new city. For the first few days, things did seem to get a little better. I had been going to the dining hall (which for anorexics is kind of like swimming with sharks) and was actually eating! But then something switched –– I had been flying high, without any structure, but finally got a little too close to the sun. I started to lose control and started bingeing. It was almost as though the years of starvation had finally caught up. I wasn’t just hungry –– I was absolutely insatiable.</p>
<p>I went on a three week long binge. I don’t remember much of it, just a few flashes of floating in and out of restaurants and cafes, ordering and eating, and then heading to the next spot. I remember a few failed attempts at trying to tell my mom and therapist what was going on, but I was paralyzed by fear. Then one day I finally found some inkling of courage to send the text, “Mom, I’m not okay. I need to come home.”</p>
<p>That night, I landed in the hospital. I don’t remember anything from those few days other than the sound of my mom’s shoes walking quickly down the hospital hallway. Needless to say, I got my wish. I went home.</p>
<p>For the next year I was in an intensive treatment program where I got serious about my recovery. I went to individual therapy, family therapy, group therapy where we held stones that had words like “hope” and “love” etched on them, nutrition class, group meals, individual meals, group outings –– it was all about learning basic living skills. It was learning how to cope, how to feel, how to be okay amidst the inevitable chaos of life. It was learning how to love myself and how to show up for others.</p>
<p>Recovery is life-long. There is no magic moment where you’re suddenly better. Relapse is extremely common in eating disorders and I was no exception. But through continued therapy, self care, meditation, and mindfulness, I am able to stay the course and live in a way that’s authentic and healthy. I have bad days where I feel the pull towards that path of self-destruction. But today I also have choices.</p>
<p>If I had to share a message with anyone who’s suffering, I would tell them to surrender their control and take a leap into the unknown. I would tell them that what’s waiting on the other side of their fear is a life that’s beyond their wildest dreams. Life can be beautiful and rich and exciting and scary and wild and passionate and uncomfortable and messy and it is all so worth it. All you have to do it live one day at time and you’ll be amazed by the strength you can muster when you get out of your own way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a therapist who specializes in eating disorders and body image issues, I have worked with clients who begin therapy and — as they make progress — show signs of having an eating disorder. This doesn’t happen in an obvious way, though. To make the diagnosis, I analyze what they’re saying and look for subtle signs.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, I am going to share two different client scenarios below. Each of them may seem like a typical case of anxiety, mild depression and struggles with self-confidence and lack of happiness. With a closer look through the lens of an eating disorder therapist, these two stories take on different meanings.<span id="more-5267"></span></p>
<h2>Client Scenario 1: Depression and Anxiety with Subtle Signs of an Eating Disorder</h2>
<p>A client and therapist have been meeting for several sessions. The client’s initial reason for therapy was to deal with anxiety and depression that seem to come and go.</p>
<p>In the sessions, the client talks about how anxious she becomes when people invite her to a social event. In these discussions she also mentions the idea of eating in front of others is difficult. Her anxiety increases and she cannot focus on what is happening.</p>
<p>She loses her train of thought when talking or finds it difficult to engage in any meaningful conversation with others. After she departs from the social event, she is left feeling disconnected and depressed.</p>
<h2>Client Scenario 2: Confusing a ‘Lifestyle Change’ with Something Else</h2>
<p>Another client comes into therapy because she is struggling with feeling confident in herself. She says she needs to make a few changes that will help her feel more positive.</p>
<p>From the start she is talking about how she has tried many diets, but they don’t seem to work long-term. She feels good when she is working the diet. At some point, however, she blows the diet and is back to feeling like she will never be able to lose the weight and feel good.</p>
<p>She is currently trying a “lifestyle” change and is working with an online healthy living coach. She has lost some weight and is feeling good about this. During her sessions she reports to you how well she is doing with following her diet and how good this makes her feel.</p>
<p>She also shares that she has been to several social events. Each time she has brought her own food because the thought of not knowing what foods will be there makes her really anxious. If there are any “bad” foods being served, she couldn’t take the chance of ruining her day by eating these foods.</p>
<h2>Looking Past the Surface</h2>
<p>If you are not looking for eating disorder red flags, you would likely see the first client only as someone who is struggling with anxiety that can lead to feelings of depression. The second client could be seen as a woman who has been struggling with having confidence and simply did not find a diet that “worked.”</p>
<p>If you are looking through the lens of an eating disorder therapist, however, this anxiety/depression and struggle to find confidence and happiness looks much different.</p>
<p>The unspoken signs with the first client could sound like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>“My days are spent thinking about food, what foods I can eat, which foods are off limits.”</li>
<li>“If I eat that food I am going to feel like such a bad person.”</li>
<li>“I don’t deserve to eat anything.”</li>
<li>“When I am in a social event that involves food, I feel so overwhelmed, anxious and scared I can’t concentrate on anything except all the food thoughts and food rules that are going through my head.”</li>
</ul>
<p>With the second client the thoughts might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I hate my body”</li>
<li>“I will never be thin enough or pretty enough for anyone or good enough for anyone or anything.”</li>
<li>“I can’t eat any foods that are not on my food ‘rules’ list.</li>
<li>“If I do eat any bad foods, I am such a failure.”</li>
</ul>
<p>When you look at each client through the lens of an eating disorder therapist, the stories become different. Eating disorders are deceptive. It is easy to miss their unspoken signs.</p>
<p>Remember, these signs don’t guarantee the client has an eating disorder. They are, however, always worth discussing.</p>
<h2>Going Beyond the Stereotypes of an Eating Disorder</h2>
<p>Both of these clients could be of average, above average or somewhat below average weight for a person their size. Unless a client is severely under or overweight, a therapist cannot look at a client and determine from their size if they do or do not have an eating disorder. With the exception of the client deciding on their own that they need help with their eating disorder, it is going to take the skills of the therapist to discover and bring into discussion the unspoken signs.</p>
<p>We often think of people with eating disorders as having some sort of extreme weight or symptom such as binging or purging. People with eating disorders can look or act much different than that, though.</p>
<p>An eating disorder can be anything that includes “extreme emotions, attitudes and behaviors surrounding weight and food issues,” according to the National Eating Disorders Association <a href="http://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/general-information" target="_blank">[NEDA]</a>. If anything related to food, weight or body image prevents you from living a full and happy life, it is a mental health issue — maybe something a therapist can help you with.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8211; by Katie Colton</em></p>
<p>I had the opportunity to work at a clinical research lab with a young woman who suffered from bulimia nervosa. She said no one close to her knew she had an eating disorder because she had an average body weight and only binged or purged when she was alone.</p>
<p>She was happy no one knew about her disorder but simultaneously hoped someone would notice what she was going through and try to help. She felt both proud and ashamed of what she was doing to her body and had trouble admitting she had a problem.<span id="more-4423"></span></p>
<p>Her symptoms emerged at the end of her freshman year of college because she was overwhelmed by schoolwork and gained weight suddenly.</p>
<p>Although no one made comments about her size, she felt like people were looking at her “fat” and silently scrutinizing her body all the time. She interpreted unrelated comments as evidence she was “overweight.” She felt uncomfortable being a “larger size” than the rest of her friends.</p>
<p>Beyond her body image concerns, she also suffered from depression due to low self-esteem about her academic ability. She felt like various aspects of her life were “falling apart” — her grades, her body and her social life.</p>
<p>She binged when she felt depressed or anxious and purged when she felt “fat” or “out of control.” She wished she “had more self-control” like her friends who were “skinny” and “academically successful.”</p>
<p>Bulimia nervosa is a serious, potentially life-threatening condition that affects 1-2% of adolescent and young adult women, according to <a href="http://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/bulimia-nervosa" target="_blank">The National Eating Disorders Association</a>. Approximately 80% of sufferers are female.</p>
<p>Individuals usually appear to have an average body weight and often suffer from depression and low self-esteem. It’s important to recognize these <a href="http://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/bulimia-nervosa" target="_blank">common signs and symptoms</a> of bulimia nervosa if someone you know needs help.</p>
<p>This young woman felt ashamed of her illness and afraid to open up about her experience. Although I wasn’t her therapist, she was relieved to tell me about her symptoms and became motivated to tell others and get the help she needed. This is typical of many women dealing with an eating disorder who end up <a href="http://healingforeatingdisorders.com/newsite/is-fear-holding-you-back-in-your-bulimia-recovery/" target="_blank">suffering in silence</a> out of fear of rejection and being “found out.”</p>
<p>Eventually she was able to open up to her sister and a close friend about her condition. Telling her story and receiving supportive feedback allowed her to accept her symptoms and seek therapy.</p>
<p>In honor of National Eating Disorder Day, let’s become aware of these stories and support people on their path toward recovery. Their experiences are rich and nuanced. They deserve our attention. By understanding and empathizing with individuals who have struggled with an eating disorder, we can aid sufferers in overcoming internalized stigma and feeling safe enough to come forward.</p>
