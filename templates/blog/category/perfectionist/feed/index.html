<hr />
<p>In the business world, there are no gold stars for effort or report cards to gauge your progress.</p>
<p>Yet a common mistake is treating work like school. As CEO and author, Sallie Krawcheck <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/26/the-single-biggest-mistake-ive-seen-women-make-at-work-sallie-krawcheck-commentary.html" target="_blankrel=">points out</a>:</p>
<p><em>Let&#8217;s not confuse what made us <a class="recomendedHyperlink" href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/how-to-be-successful" target="_blank">successful</a> in school for what can make us successful in our careers.</em></p>
<p>While an honor roll mindset can translate into a drive to succeed that lands you deals and accolades, it can easily lead to <a href="http://melodywilding.com/what-to-do-when-your-boss-is-a-workaholic-and-expects-you-to-be-one-too/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">workaholism and burnout</a>. The industriousness that served you well in school may now be what&#8217;s actually <em>hindering</em> your <a class="recomendedHyperlink" href="https://fairygodboss.com/articles/how-to-be-productive-at-work-9-ideas-for-tackling-your-to-do-list-in-less-time" target="_blank">productivity</a> and professional progress.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because when you hold yourself to exacting standards — as many high-achievers do — you can get caught in the trap of perfectionism.</p>
<p><span id="more-10139"></span></p>
<p>The result? Feeling perpetually frustrated, stressed, unacknowledged, or like you never measure up.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some signs an honor student hangover might be costing you:</p>
<h2><strong>1. You beat yourself up when you make a mistake.</strong></h2>
<p>For you, a goof is really hard for you to rebound from — even if it doesn&#8217;t have a larger effect on your career standing.</p>
<p>Perfectionists experience shame, as opposed to guilt, over screwing up. Shame says &#8220;I am bad&#8221; (which suggests a character flaw) whereas guilt says, &#8220;I did something wrong&#8221;.</p>
<h2><strong>2. If something isn&#8217;t perfect, it&#8217;s not good enough.</strong></h2>
<p>You insist on dotting every &#8220;i&#8221; and crossing every &#8220;t&#8221; on every single task, or else it just doesn&#8217;t sit right with you. That tunnel vision can stunt your <a href="https://melodywilding.com/the-perfectionists-guide-to-making-decisions-the-art-of-satisficing/" target="_blankrel=">ability to make decisions</a> and move forward.</p>
<p>Attention to detail is obviously an important skill that makes you successful (even if you&#8217;re not being graded on it anymore). But there&#8217;s a difference between excellent and perfect. The latter does not exist.</p>
<h2><strong>3. You push yourself to work harder — not necessarily smarter.</strong></h2>
<p>You&#8217;re never satisfied with yourself, most notably when you&#8217;re treating yourself to hard-earned deserved downtime, which you probably view as wasteful.</p>
<p>This penchant to give your all to your career can come at the expense of your well-being, leaving you ripe for burnout.</p>
<h2><strong>4. You expect gold stars.</strong></h2>
<p>In her book <em>The Happiness Project</em>, happiness expert <a href="http://gretchenrubin.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gretchen Rubin</a> talks about her frustration with not receiving metaphorical gold stars for adult achievement. If you feel expectant of and disappointed by not getting <a href="http://melodywilding.com/5-steps-to-take-after-you-get-turned-down-for-a-raise/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a pat on the back</a> for your successes, you&#8217;re probably suffering from honor student hangover, too.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing: it&#8217;s great to have high standards, and even better to be able to actually hit them <em>most</em> of the time.</p>
<p>But if you operate in your career constantly striving for A-pluses, the effort is not only futile, but also harmful. You&#8217;re going to burn out.</p>
<p>And besides, it&#8217;s simply not possible. It&#8217;s not how the working world, well, works. Trying to achieve the same &#8220;Gifted and Talented&#8221; student status in your job is a dream destined to go unfulfilled.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how you can hold on to high standards, but keep perfectionism in check.</p>
<h2><strong>1. Face up to the ironic consequences.</strong></h2>
<p>Not only does having an honor student hangover from your adolescence into your adulthood drive you nuts with unrealistic expectations, it can actually erode your self-esteem and performance.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re constantly falling short of where you think you should be, you&#8217;re never going to feel good enough. Over the long term, that feeling of inadequacy can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy: you&#8217;ll shirk new responsibilities, avoid taking risks, and otherwise stunt your professional growth all because of fear.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Consider multiple measures of success.</strong></h2>
<p>As a student, you were graded on academic performance alone. In real life, how you define success is much more within your control.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="http://melodywilding.com/accomplishing-wont-make-happier-will/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">research shows</a> that chasing after external motivators like a prestigious title or bigger paycheck won&#8217;t make you happier. Pursuing meaningful work and deep relationships, on the hand, can result in authentic happiness.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Have some compassion for yourself.</strong></h2>
<p>Remove &#8220;I wish&#8221; and &#8220;I should&#8221; from your vocabulary. Only say things to yourself that you would say to your close friend. Cut yourself some slack.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve had a life-long track record of achievement, carrying your honor student outlook into your professional life is something that probably happened naturally, and it&#8217;s not the easiest habit to shed.</p>
<p>Start to separate the parts of that mentality that are productive from the ones that no longer serve you.</p>
<p>Then you can strive to continue succeeding without the weight of trying to reach an unreasonable bar.</p>
