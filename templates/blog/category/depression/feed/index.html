				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve hit rock bottom before, you know how much it sucks&#8230;and you probably want to make sure you never get to that point again. Maybe you remember the warning signs you felt the last time, and now you’re sitting here thinking, “Oh crap, I feel a breakdown coming on!” Well, that’s your sign that you gotta protect yourself and prevent that nervous breakdown from actually happening.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s not so effective to just sit around and wish rock bottom away. When we feel ourselves declining, we have to be proactive and take steps to make positive changes and pick ourselves up — before the worst actually happens. Here are 6 ideas to get you moving in the right direction.</p>
<p><span id="more-11399"></span></p>
<h2>1. Ask For Help</h2>
<p>It’s hard to get through a crisis by yourself. If you feel like you’re headed for a bad place, don’t be afraid or ashamed to ask for help! You can talk to a trusted friend, family member, or a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/mental-health-counselor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health professional</a>. Ask for advice, vent to them, cry on their shoulder — whatever you need to do.</p>
<p>The person you open up to can also hold you accountable for positive changes you hope to make and inspire you to keep going. If you’re not in therapy, consider finding a therapist in person or <a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/online-therapy-with-a-licensed-therapist?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_POST_INLINE&amp;utr_adgroup=inline-link-cta&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/11/positive-change-before-rock-bottom&amp;var=promo-b&amp;partner=Talkspace%20Blog&amp;code=BLOG45">online</a>. If you’re already in therapy, be open about the fact that you’re struggling. Maybe you can be squeezed in for another session or a phone chat. And, while sometimes a rough patch is temporary and you can just ride it out, other times a bad spell can be longer lasting. If so, don’t be afraid to reach out to a therapist.</p>
<p>Remember: <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/how-to-ask-for-help-mental-health-care/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asking for help</a> is not a sign of weakness!</p>
<h2>2. Say “No” When You Need To</h2>
<p>When you’re nearing rock bottom, you have to put yourself first, and that means saying no to others. You might be used to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/09/assert-yourself-at-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">always saying “yes”</a> to people to please them, but sometimes when your mental health is at stake, you need to be a tiny bit selfish. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/working-hard-burning-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doing too much</a> and spreading yourself too thin might push you over the edge.</p>
<p>Saying “no” could mean cancelling plans with friends and explaining that you need to take a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/12-best-ways-spend-mental-health-day-according-therapist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health day</a>, or calling out of work for a day or two to regroup. Use this time to yourself to relax, take care of yourself, or get the extra help you need.</p>
<h2>3. Monitor Your Emotions</h2>
<p>Keep a journal or log of your moods and emotions. This can be in a notebook or on your phone — whichever you’re more likely to keep up with. Be introspective and aware of what you’re feeling. You know yourself better than anybody else does, and you can probably feel it when you’re heading downhill.</p>
<p>When you write down how you’re feeling and compare it to days or weeks prior in your log, you can get a better idea of where you stand in the moment: better than usual, staying steady on cruise control, or taking a wrong turn. With <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/5-therapist-approved-ways-de-stress-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journaling</a>, you’ll have a long term log that you can learn from, and possibly identify triggers and patterns along the way. It can be helpful to share this info with your therapist!</p>
<p>This way, you’re learning from the past and using this information to improve in the future.</p>
<h2>4. Indulge In Your Favorite Self-Care Methods</h2>
<p>When you feel rock bottom getting closer, it’s time to kick your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/self-care-stop-stress-secrets/">self-care</a> into overdrive. If you’re feeling like you don’t even know where to start, or feeling so hopeless that you don&#8217;t know what will make you feel better, you can make a list of three things you can do in the next three days that you know will help calm you down and make you feel at least a teeny bit better.</p>
<p>Some ideas could be: taking a yoga class, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/meditation-science-eases-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meditating</a>, treating yourself to a massage, taking a candlelit bath, or coloring in a coloring book. Listen to your mind and body — what kind of love and attention are they craving?</p>
<p>Think about the last time you felt mentally unwell. What did you do that helped? Use that as motivation to do it again.</p>
<h2>5. Focus On Your Overall Health</h2>
<p>Physical and mental health go hand in hand. When you feel your mental health declining, it’s a good idea to check in with yourself physically and see if there are any changes you can make to your daily life that can be beneficial. Are you getting enough sleep, or staying up all night? Are you eating regularly, or constantly skipping meals? Feeling physically well will help give you energy and power to fight through this rough patch.</p>
<p>You can also assess your caffeine intake, as too much <a href="https://www.webmd.com/balance/features/brewing-trouble#1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">caffeine can induce anxiety</a> — or worsen existing anxiety. On top of maintaining these basic areas of your life, avoid inherently unhealthy behaviors like illegal drug use or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/when-weekend-drinking-turns-into-a-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excessive drinking</a>. Drugs and alcohol might seem like a nice, quick fix to forget about the problem you’re dealing with, but in reality, they can cause you to spiral out, and even cause further problems down the road.</p>
<h2>6. Cut Toxic People Out Of Your Life</h2>
<p>You might be dealing with some “<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/set-boundaries-energy-vampires/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">energy vampires”</a> who are making you feel even worse. These toxic people can make it easier for you to end up on the fast track to rock bottom. They can drain the energy that you need to keep up the positive lifestyle changes you’re making, and they can also influence you to make poor decisions.</p>
<p>When you’re in a negative place mentally, you need to focus your energy on yourself and your wellbeing, not whatever the energy vampire is trying to get you to focus on. You might need to cut some people out of your life, or at least take a break from the toxic person, distancing yourself and requesting space while you aren’t at your best.</p>
<h2>Stay Away from the Bottom by Looking Up</h2>
<p>Follow these tips and you’ll be on track to making positive changes in your life that’ll stop you from reaching your lowest point.</p>
<p>Everyone has moments of weakness and crisis, and everyone has their own ways to cope and return to their mental health baseline. Plus, you can always remember this: It’s always okay to ask for help and there’s only one way to go from rock bottom and that’s up.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My adult life could be easily divided into two very distinct segments: BAD (before Adam died) and AAD (after Adam died). To anyone who doesn’t know me or Adam, that may sound a bit dramatic; I was only 24 when he died, which is a very early age to have your life virtually divided in half. But his death had a profound effect on me.</p>
<p><span id="more-11107"></span></p>
<p>Adam hanged himself after a short bout with early onset schizophrenia. While he had battled depression, eating disorders, and anxiety for the 10 years I had known him, his death was a complete shock to me and the rest of his friends and family. In fact, in the summer before he died, Adam had given up drinking alcohol and caffeine and took up a robust health regime.</p>
<p>For me, the biggest part of the months following Adam’s death was trying to make sense of it. In the aftermath of his death, his family and friends were left trying to piece together a reason why he would have done this.</p>
<p>At the same time, I found there was a desperate need to find someone to blame. One of the biggest problems with suicide is that your friend or loved one has been murdered, and at the same time, they have become a murderer. I was extremely angry at him while also being sad he was gone. His parents sought out explanations for how the health care team that had been treating Adam had missed his schizophrenia. We all sought a responsible party, someone to blame.</p>
<p>But in the end, Adam was responsible.</p>
<h2>The Need to Talk About It</h2>
<p>What I wanted to do most after his death was to talk about Adam. I wanted to tell his story to anyone who would listen, and even people who wouldn’t. Strangers on commuter trains to New York City would get an earful about my beloved best friend and the perils of mental illness and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/what-is-schizophrenia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">schizophrenia</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as I found out, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/attempting-to-understand-suicide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suicide</a> is an extremely taboo subject in our society. Even people who loved me deeply would shoo the subject away like an annoying fly. While distraction was helpful a lot of the time, what I needed most was to talk to someone about Adam, to memorialize him, and to try and sort out the nonsense I felt like life had suddenly become.</p>
<p>It ends up that talking about the individual, and the feelings that come from losing them, is one of the most important parts of grieving the loss of a loved one to suicide. According to Talkspace <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">therapist</a> Cynthia Catchings, LCSW-S, talking to someone who listens, understands, and cares about you is important to the healing process. She also recommends both individual therapy sessions and suicide support groups, which are particularly helpful for anyone who has lost someone to suicide.</p>
<p>“Individual sessions allow the person to talk and express their feelings and to find ways to regain their confidence, happiness, and positive outlook on life,” she says.</p>
<h2>Dark Night of the Soul</h2>
<p>My brain did funny things after Adam died; it played tricks on me. I had trouble sleeping and eating, and I lost a concerning amount of weight. I cried at the drop of a hat. I was panicked that people were going to disappear from my life without warning. I reached out to anyone who had known Adam to tell them about his life.</p>
<p>While it’s hard to admit, I also had dark nights dealing with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/common-questions-suicide-with-talkspace-therapists/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suicidal thoughts</a> myself. This is also one of the worst parts of a loved one’s suicide: it can be contagious. According to Catchings, the risk of suicide jumps in loved ones who lose someone to suicide in the months and even years after their death.</p>
<p>“A person who has lost someone to suicide is at increased risk for <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depression</a> and/or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a>,” she explains. “Studies show that thinking about, planning, or attempting suicide is a result of those risk factors.”</p>
<p>“When someone loses a loved one to suicide, it&#8217;s not rare for him/her/they to blame themselves or to wish they were dead,” she adds. “That wish does not mean that they will act on it, but it can exacerbate the depression, resulting in not eating or sleeping, which can be detrimental to their health.”</p>
<p>She recommends that anyone who has lost someone to suicide take steps to take care of themselves by <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/sleep-deprivation-hurts-mental-health/">getting enough sleep</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/how-to-eat-your-way-to-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eating healthy foods</a>, and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/mental-health-workout-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exercising</a>. “That will improve your mood and health in general,” Catchings says.</p>
<p>I was lucky to be in a supportive community where I could find help. My boyfriend at the time was very supportive, and dealt with my crying jags and insomnia with care and sympathy. I started seeing a psychiatrist who also worked in talk therapy, and I was prescribed several medications to help me through the most difficult darkness.</p>
<h2>A Community of Loss</h2>
<p>I also found that I was by no means alone in having lost someone. The people who were most helpful during my initial <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/finding-help-complicated-grief/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grief</a> were those who had been through it themselves. There were many people in my life who were available to listen and share their own stories. This was my own suicide support group, and it helped me immensely during the hardest parts of losing Adam.</p>
<p>“Suicide support groups allow the person to learn from others, to share, and to realize they are not alone,” Catchings says.</p>
<p>My life AAD has given me a support group and access to a greater community of those who’ve experienced similar loss. In fact, I believe that I am now a much more compassionate person than I might have been otherwise.</p>
<p>Having gone through the ordeal myself, I know how to help friends through loss, especially <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/experience-survivors-suicide-therapist-person/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">losing someone to suicide</a>. I know how to prompt them to tell me how they feel and how to offer them a safe space to talk. I know how to encourage them to find a good therapist that they connect with, even if it’s hard and even if insurance makes it difficult. I know to listen without judgment when they talk about their darkest feelings.</p>
<p>I also know that time is the greatest healer. The best advice I have ever received when the feelings were overwhelming was: <i>Wait</i>.</p>
<p>“Accept your emotions, since the feelings are normal but will not be permanent,” Cynthia Catchings adds.</p>
<p>I think of the emotions of loss as waves on a beach. Sometimes they’ll be heavier and raging from a storm; sometimes they’ll be calm and smooth; sometimes they’ll be far off from a low tide. All you have to do is wait for them to change.</p>
<p>While my life may never be the same again, I learned lessons from Adam’s death that I would not trade. If I have to miss him, I may as well have learned something from his absence.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anxiety and depression are intricately linked, which is why the same types of therapy and the same classes of medications are often used to treat both disorders.</p>
<p>In my practice, I have noticed that many clients that have self-diagnosed as depressed are actually experiencing anxiety. Similarly, many clients who identify as anxious are often depressed. Here, I will explain the connections between anxiety and depression, and why one can lead to the other.</p>
<p><span id="more-11057"></span></p>
<h2>Shared Traits and Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression</h2>
<h3>Nervous Energy</h3>
<p>When you are anxious, your predominant feeling is that of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/trained-worry-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worry</a>, and being wound too tightly. You feel like you can’t relax, and that danger is everywhere in some form or another. However, the irritability associated with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/">depression</a> gives you a similar wound up feeling. Often, the overlap between the two can be difficult to tease apart.</p>
<h3>Avoidance or Retreat</h3>
<p>Anxiety makes people retreat from situations, out of fear that they will be evaluated poorly, or that some danger will befall them. Depression also leads to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/identifying-avoidant-partner-improve-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retreat from the world</a>, since you feel so negatively about yourself and others that you can’t imagine a reason to purposefully put yourself into contact with other people.</p>
<h3>Negative Thinking</h3>
<p>When you are depressed, you see the worst in every situation. The depressive cognitive triad includes <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/negative-thinking-got-you-down-heres-how-to-shift-your-thoughts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative thoughts</a> about yourself, the world, and the future. For example, going to a party, you may think, “nobody will like me, I’m not going to make any friends.” There may in fact be a strong likelihood of this outcome coming to pass, since when you’re depressed, you don’t act as outgoing, engaged, or responsive.</p>
<p>However, if you focus on these negative thoughts about others, you may end up diagnosing yourself as <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/01/what-causes-social-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">socially anxious</a>, and not recognizing the major impact that your depression has on your thinking.</p>
<h3>Behavioral Changes</h3>
<p>Additionally, both <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/">anxiety</a> and depression can result in changes in your behavior.</p>
<p>Anxiety and depression can both prompt people to withdraw from social situations, for different reasons. However, let’s say you withdraw from parties due to fatigue and apathy. Eventually when you’re out of practice at socializing, you will in fact have raised your chances for developing social anxiety, as any anxiety deepens with avoidance of the feared situation.</p>
<p>It’s much the same when you stop engaging in world-expanding behaviors, like driving, flying, or even leaving the house, due to anxiety. Over time, your world will shrink and you may become depressed thinking about all of your missed opportunities.</p>
<h2>No Matter the Challenge, Therapy Can Help</h2>
<p>Whether you’re anxious, depressed, or (sometimes) both, therapy can help you get yourself back on track. A good therapist can help you identify what you’re feeling, and work to treat the exact issues you are struggling with.</p>
<p>There is no shame in getting help and support from a trained professional. Once you and your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">therapist</a> figure out how your anxiety or depression, or both, is manifesting in your life, you can both figure out next steps to take to create a life that makes you feel happy and fulfilled.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone affected by breast cancer knows the physical hardship it can bring. What’s less commonly talked about, but also important, is how breast cancer affects patients’ and survivors’ mental health.</p>
<p>A history of mental illness can be exacerbated by a breast cancer diagnosis, and the rigors of treatment — while life-saving — are difficult, leaving many women depressed, anxious, or feeling alone.</p>
<p>October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, a time to recognize women affected by breast cancer and raise awareness about breast cancer prevention. Many breast cancer survivors have <a href="https://www.lbbc.org/news-opinion/%E2%80%98you-feel-so-lost%E2%80%99-facing-breast-cancer-when-you-have-mood-or-anxiety-disorder" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">spoken up</a> about their struggles with mental illness. To honor their voices, here’s what you need to know about breast cancer and mental health.</p>
<p><span id="more-11023"></span></p>
<h2>Breast Cancer Can Negatively Impact Mental Health</h2>
<p>If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with breast cancer, you know firsthand that a diagnosis can have long-lasting mental health effects. From <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a> about the future to the stress of treatment, it’s totally normal to feel a mix of intense emotions after a breast cancer diagnosis.</p>
<p>While normal, this turmoil can cause long-term mental health challenges. <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/03/160302082618.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Studies show</a> that a majority of people with breast cancer will subsequently develop symptoms of PTSD, and these symptoms tend to last longer than a year. Even after successful treatment, fear of recurrence <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pon.3452" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">affects many women</a> and can be so severe it negatively impacts their quality of life.</p>
<p>After a breast cancer diagnosis, a woman’s relationship with her body might change as well. While life-saving, mastectomies can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4743280/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">decrease women’s body confidence</a>, impact their relationships to their sexuality, and have a negative effect on overall mental health.</p>
<h2>Your Mental Health Affects Your Physical Health</h2>
<p>Mental illness doesn’t just cause distress to breast cancer patients, it can actually impact their physical health, including their mortality risk.</p>
<p>Pre-existing mental health conditions can make it harder for a patient to cope after a breast cancer diagnosis, in turn negatively affecting their long-term physical and emotional health. A history of trauma <a href="https://healthblog.uofmhealth.org/cancer-care/mental-health-may-predict-pain-levels-after-breast-cancer-treatment" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">can increase</a> breast cancer survivors’ risk of chronic pain even after treatment. More alarmingly, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10549-013-2795-4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">several studies</a> <a href="http://www.cancernetwork.com/breast-cancer/breast-cancer-patients-mental-illness-face-higher-mortality-risk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">have found</a> that women with depression have a higher risk of mortality both from the cancer itself and from other factors — <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/hematologyoncology/breastcancer/70104" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">up to double</a> the risk of death in elderly women.</p>
<p>While grim, these findings make sense. As the American Psychological Association <a href="http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/breast-cancer.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">points out</a>, a breast cancer diagnosis is a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/recognizing-trauma-vs-ptsd-quick-primer-symptoms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traumatic event</a> and it’s normal to have a range of emotional reactions to the diagnosis. Meanwhile, mental illness can exacerbate these natural feelings, making it even harder for patients to do things that benefit their health, like eat healthy foods, exercise, connect with friends and family, and perhaps most importantly, comply with their medical treatment.</p>
<p>The good news? Prioritizing mental health can actually be lifesaving. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2661422/?tool=pubmed" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Research shows</a> that women with breast cancer who avail of mental health support have a decreased risk of recurrence and death, even years after therapy.</p>
<h2>Seeking Support for a Breast Cancer Diagnosis</h2>
<p>If you’ve been diagnosed with breast cancer, it’s a great idea to talk to a therapist. A therapist <a href="http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/breast-cancer.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">can help you cope</a> throughout your breast cancer journey.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/breast-cancer.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">APA recommends</a> a combination of group therapy, which allows women to share emotional support, and individual therapy, which helps women learn problem-solving skills and alter patterns of negative thinking. A therapist can also help you work through <a href="https://share.upmc.com/2017/10/life-after-mastectomy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">body image or sexuality</a> issues related to a mastectomy or treatment in general.</p>
<p>While breast cancer and mental illness may both feel like insurmountably large problems, you can take simple steps every day to feel better. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/how-to-exercise-your-way-to-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Staying as active as you can</a>, focusing on healthy eating including lots of fruits and vegetables, and reaching out to friends, family, a support group, or a faith group can all help, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/survivors/patients/staying-healthy-during-cancer-treatment.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">says the CDC</a>.</p>
<p>You also don’t have to be a medical professional to give support to people in your life with breast cancer. Social support matters, too. <a href="https://www.oatext.com/Social-support-quality-of-life-and-mental-health-status-in-breast-cancer-patients.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Research shows</a> that having supportive intimate partners and family members increases breast cancer survivors’ overall wellbeing.</p>
<h3>Caretakers Deserve Care, Too</h3>
<p>If someone in your life is diagnosed with breast cancer, it’s normal to want to do everything you can to support them. That’s a great impulse, and your loved one deserves all the care and support you can offer. But in looking out for your loved ones, don’t forget to care for yourself.</p>
<p>A breast cancer diagnosis doesn’t just affect the mental health of the person with cancer; it can also have a serious effect on the mental health of family and friends. One study revealed that men whose partners had breast cancer were at an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20878654" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">increased risk</a> of hospitalization for an affective disorder like depression subsequent to the diagnosis. While it’s easy to feel that you don’t deserve support since you’re not the one with the diagnosis, that’s simply untrue: taking care of yourself makes you better able to care for your loved ones.</p>
<h2>Personal Support is Crucial</h2>
<p>A breast cancer diagnosis can make patients and their loved ones feel powerless, and mental health issues, while common, can exacerbate this feeling. Some things truly are outside of our control, and accepting this can make you feel understandably overwhelmed. But there are simple things we can do to support the mental health of loved ones with breast cancer every single day.</p>
<p>One of the most effective strategies is also the simplest: simply be there.</p>
<p><i>If you or a loved one are struggling after a breast cancer diagnosis, you deserve support. The American Cancer Society has a range of </i><a href="https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/emotional-side-effects/anxiety-fear-depression.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><i>mental health</i></a> <a href="https://www.cancer.org/treatment/support-programs-and-services.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><i>resources</i></a><i> for people with cancer and caretakers. You can also consult the Susan G. Komen Foundation’s </i><a href="https://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/SupportGroups.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><i>list</i></a><i> of breast cancer support groups. </i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have children, you know raising kids presents challenges on your best days. Parents with mental illness, however, have it even harder.</p>
<p>In particular, parental depression can wreak havoc on a child’s psyche. What’s worse, when children develop problems related to parental depression, the added stress can make that parent’s depression worse. Thus, parental depression can turn into a long-lasting cycle of negative outcomes for the entire family.</p>
<p><span id="more-10900"></span></p>
<h2>The Effects of Parental Depression on Children</h2>
<p>In my own practice as a therapist who works with children and families, I find when parents struggle with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a>, parenting gets harder for them. Studies agree. In fact, a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16551710" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study</a> published in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> concluded, “Parental depression is among the most consistent and well-replicated risk factors for childhood anxiety and disruptive behavior disorders and for major depressive disorder.”</p>
<p>Not only do children with depressed parents likely have an increased <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/is-depression-genetic/" target="_blank">genetic risk </a>for mental illness themselves, but the parent’s depressive symptoms create additional environmental stress for the child.</p>
<p>For example, if you struggle with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/what-is-crippling-depression/" target="_blank">depression</a>, you know how hard it can be to maintain your performance at work, your duties at home, and your relationships with friends and family. If depression causes additional stressors such as marital problems or job loss, children also suffer.</p>
<p>When children grow up in stressful or uncertain environments, they can develop their own behavioral or emotional problems. Defiance, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxiety</a>, or depression are common outcomes. In fact, the majority of children I see in my practice experience family stressors. We must first address issues with their parents before we can expect the child’s behavior to improve.</p>
<h2>How Depression Affects Parenting</h2>
<p>Depression is a complex mental illness, and everyone’s experience and challenges with it differ slightly. Here are some ways a parent’s depression affects a child or family, to help recognize where changes can be made.</p>
<h3>Disrupted attachment and bonding</h3>
<p>When parents struggle with the low energy, lack of joy, and the social withdrawal depression causes, they can’t engage fully with their children. They may even have trouble mustering energy to take care of a child’s basic needs, so children learn to rely on themselves when parents are too hard to reach.</p>
<h3>Disrupted coping skills</h3>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5842251/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study</a> in the journal <i>European Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</i>, children appear to learn different coping mechanisms from mothers and fathers, so depression in either parent can affect how the child handles stress. The authors suggest mothers tend to be a calming influence, providing support when the child is upset. On the other hand, fathers tend to encourage more assertive or active coping strategies.</p>
<p>Therefore, while a child’s coping deficits may vary depending on which parent suffers depression, the impact on the child remains.</p>
<h3>Increased parental guilt or self-blame</h3>
<p>Parents who suffer from depression usually know their <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/dealing-depression-need-know/" target="_blank">symptoms</a> affect their parenting, but may find it difficult to make changes they know their children need. In addition, the negative thought patterns and rumination that go along with depression may make parents assume their parenting is worse than it really is.</p>
<p>These factors set up a cycle of guilt and self-criticism that further shakes a parent’s confidence in his or her abilities. In fact, a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5392125/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study</a> in the <i>Maternal and Child Health Journal</i> found that feeling more effective as a parent may decrease the parent’s depressive symptoms.</p>
<h3>Reinforcement of ineffective parenting strategies</h3>
<p>In my experience, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/09/pass-mental-illness-to-kids-children/" target="_blank">parents who believe they caused their children’s problems</a> have trouble setting appropriate limits with common childhood behaviors (think tantrum-ing toddler or curfew-violating teen).</p>
<p>In addition, parents who doubt their abilities may be more anxious, tending to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/raised-by-anxious-parents-heres-how-it-might-be-affecting-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">reinforce anxiety</a> in their children rather than confidently facing typical challenges such as separation anxiety. Because they have gotten into ineffective patterns and don’t know what else to do, parents in these situations often give in to misbehavior or inadvertently encourage a child’s distress.</p>
<h2>What Should Parents With Depression Do?</h2>
<p>Parenting with depression doesn’t have to be a permanent or hopeless scenario. There are plenty of ways to find help or treatment for depression, and also provide solutions for your child to help cope with a parent working through mental health challenges.</p>
<h3>1. Ask for professional help with parenting</h3>
<p>In my practice, I find parents with depression benefit from specific guidance on how to parent effectively, not just how to manage their own symptoms. A professional can help you understand typical childhood behavior, how your unique symptoms might affect that behavior, and how to develop a parenting style that works best for you.</p>
<h3>2. Get help for your child</h3>
<p>A neutral, trained adult who understands the child’s experience can alleviate much of the distress children experience when a parent has a mental illness. A <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a> can teach your child about depression and how to cope effectively when it interferes with your relationship.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, this therapy can improve the child’s behavioral and emotional problems, breaking <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/black-white-thinking-ways-poisons-your-perspective/" target="_blank">negative cycles</a> that make parental depression worse.</p>
<h3>3. Find joy in small things</h3>
<p>Sometimes living with depression means being too overwhelmed to appreciate the moment. Children, however, live in the moment all the time. In addition, they appreciate even the smallest doses of undivided attention. While you get professional help for yourself and your child, look for small joys you can share together. A 10-minute board game, a favorite snack, or a quick walk outside can make a world of difference for you both.</p>
<h2>4. Find Help for Yourself</h2>
<p>If you’re struggling with depression, day-to-day living can be overwhelming, especially if you’re also responsible for the welfare of children. Significant depressive symptoms need appropriate treatment. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">Psychotherapy</a> offers a wealth of proven benefits; in addition, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/am-i-going-to-be-on-meds-forever/" target="_blank">medication management</a> can help some individuals with depression achieve better symptom control.</p>
<p>By seeking help, you’ll find that parenting can become easier with time and healing, and your family — including your child (or children) — will benefit from a healthier, more positive environment.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>“<a href="https://wrt.lv/2KYHzbT" target="_blank">You Deserve to Live</a>” originally appeared on <a href="https://twloha.com/" target="_blank">To Write Love On Her Arms</a>, a nonprofit movement dedicated to presenting hope and finding help for people struggling with depression, addiction, self-injury, and suicide. </em></p>
<p><em>This piece discusses the topic of suicide and suicidal thoughts. Please use discretion.</em></p>
<p>My childhood and adolescence were marked with milestones of self-destruction.</p>
<p>When I was 13 years old, I swallowed a handful of pills; when I was 16, I did the same thing again, but this time an even larger dose, chased down with mouthwash. The first time I was sober; the second time I was drunk. Both of those incidents lead to me being hospitalized, and the latter lead to my spending month of inpatient rehab for substance abuse.</p>
<p><span id="more-10698"></span></p>
<p>I didn’t stop then: when I was 22—a month before I stopped drinking forever—I tried to run into traffic in New York City after breaking up with my ex-boyfriend.</p>
<p>All three of these times, when I made the decision to jeopardize my own existence, I truly wanted to die. In those moments, I believed that whatever I was going through—coming to terms with my sexuality, breakups, fights with friends, bad decisions—was worth ending my life.</p>
<p>Today, as I am in a place where I am focused on my mental health and self-care, looking back on those moments breaks my heart. I am so grateful that I did not succeed.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the fact that I went to such extremes to end my life isn’t shocking when I consider the sustained harm I inflicted on my body through years of fasting, binging and purging, and years of binge drinking and drug abuse. As someone who struggles with depression, anxiety, and addiction, it took me over 20 years to learn to value myself, both physically and emotionally; it took me over 20 years to convince myself I deserved to live.</p>
<p>And getting to that point was not easy or simple. It didn’t happen from a single change—in medication, in therapy, in my support system, or by cutting alcohol out of my life. Self-love and self-acceptance, rather, came from the combination of all of those positive forces. It came from looking inside myself and seeing how I was suffering and admitting it. It came from saying aloud that I needed help, and then actually allowing myself to get help.</p>
<p>That help came in many forms: from therapists, from doctors, from my family, from my friends, and also, from myself.</p>
<p>When I made the decision to stop drinking, and made the commitment to myself to live, I knew it wasn’t going to be a short journey.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t. It’s a journey that’s still happening now—a journey that may continue forever.</p>
<p>And that’s okay.</p>
<p>I know that I struggle with chronic depression and have suffered from addiction. I now live consciously, always paying attention to my mental health. I know that using substances recreationally can never again be a part of my life, and I know that therapy and antidepressants may forever more be a part of my life.</p>
<p>There are still days when I feel depressed and anxious, and there are days where I feel a sense of hopelessness. The difference now is that I know I don’t have to suffer alone. I have plans for when I feel that way, and the first step with all of those plans involves expressing how I’m feeling aloud to a therapist, a family member, or a friend.</p>
<p>I now take solace in knowing that I can overcome depths from which I never thought I would return. And remembering that I am worthy of life, and so are you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don’t know who she was.</p>
<p>It was the early 2000s, the height of the AIM craze, when middle schoolers rushed home at the end of the day to log on and start chatting. These were the early days, where we could hardly distinguish an LOL from a G2G and emojis had yet to replace emoticons (I know, (☉_☉)!).</p>
<p>One day, I was chatting with my friend when I started panicking: She had seen an apparent suicide note on someone else’s AIM profile, and didn’t know what to do. All of 13 years old, we called our respective parents to help save the day. Our parents called the police. But this was the early days of social media, when it was next to impossible to figure out where someone was or how to reach out to them.</p>
<p>To this day, I still wonder if that person is alright.</p>
<p><span id="more-10692"></span></p>
<h2>When It’s Closer to Home</h2>
<p>What if the person we’re worried about isn’t a stranger on the internet, but a family member or friend? With the <a href="https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CDC estimating</a> that 0.5% of Americans, or 1 in 200 people, have attempted to end their own life, suicide risk affects more people than we may realize. Given this number, it’s safe to assume it affects people in our own lives. With suicide the <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/suicide.shtml" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">tenth leading cause of death</a> in the United States, it’s important to know how to talk to someone you’re concerned about.</p>
<p>Worrying that someone close to us is <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/attempting-to-understand-suicide/" target="_blank">suicidal</a> can be a difficult and scary experience. It’s normal to have an intense emotional reaction, and to want to reach out. Reaching out can make all the difference. How can we be supportive and have these difficult, yet potentially life-saving conversations? Here’s what the experts advise.</p>
<h2>Know the Signs of Suicide Risk</h2>
<p>Maybe your friend or loved one has become withdrawn, or just seems down lately — or perhaps you’ve even heard them talking about suicide. Being able to recognize the warning signs is the first step in helping those going through a hard time.</p>
<p>Any loved one who seems <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/dealing-depression-need-know/" target="_blank">depressed</a> or withdrawn deserves support and concern. According to the <a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/help-someone-else/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">National Suicide Lifeline</a>, these are some signs to watch out for. If your loved one is doing any of the following, <a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reach out for help</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about wanting to die</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Saying they feel out of control or unable to think clearly</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about feeling hopeless or having no reason to live</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Saying they can’t bear the pain or feel that there’s no way out</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Looking for ways to kill themselves (like searching online or buying a gun)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Extreme mood swings</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Inability to sleep, work, or eat</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about being a burden to others</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Increased use of alcohol and drugs</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Giving away possessions or otherwise planning for death</li>
</ul>
<p>If you notice any of the above signs, it’s <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/therapists-guide-talking-friends-family-about-mental-health/" target="_blank">time for a conversation</a>. Everyone’s different, and you know when your loved one just isn’t right. If you’re ever in doubt, reach out.</p>
<h2>Reach Out if You Feel Someone is in Distress</h2>
<p>We all want to help our loved ones in distress, but actually reaching out can feel daunting, to say the least. We worry that we’ll say the wrong thing or even “give someone ideas” by openly talking about suicide. But research shows that <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1943-278X.2012.0095.x" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">asking about someone’s suicide risk</a> and talking openly and supportively about your concern doesn’t “encourage” someone to harm themselves — far from it. In reality, frank, compassionate conversations about suicide <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24998511" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">can help save lives</a>.</p>
<p>Asking is the first step. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline <a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/help-someone-else/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">recommends</a> initiating a compassionate, and non-judgemental conversation. It’s okay to be direct, but not okay to be accusatory. You can open the conversation by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/suicide/in-depth/suicide/art-20044707" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">expressing concern</a> and asking how they’re feeling: “You seem down lately and I really care about you. Are you thinking about hurting yourself?” Then, listen — really listen — to what your friend says.</p>
<p>It’s normal for you to feel shocked, upset, confused, or even angry at your friend and their actions. However, it’s important that you express concern and give support without guilting, shaming, berating, or lecturing your friend. Being suicidal isn’t something that your loved one can “just walk off” or a sign that they’re being “irresponsible.” Instead, you should be grateful that your friend is willing to open up and accept your offer of support to keep them safe, without conditions or guilt.</p>
<h2>Help Keep Your Loved One Safe in Immediate Suicide Risk</h2>
<p>When you reach out to a friend who may be feeling suicidal, it’s important to <a href="http://www.bethe1to.com/bethe1to-steps-evidence/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">assess their risk</a>. You can ask whether they’ve tried to commit suicide before, whether they’ve made a plan to commit suicide, or whether they have access to guns, drugs, or other objects that they might use in an attempt.</p>
<p>If your loved one has a plan to harm themselves, they’re at immediate risk, and it’s important to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/suicide/in-depth/suicide/art-20044707" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">take action</a>. Make sure the person is safe, remove dangerous objects or weapons if you can, and don’t leave them alone. Can call the <a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a> (1-800-273-8255), call 911, or drive them to the nearest hospital emergency room for immediate support.</p>
<h2>Build Support if Risk is Occasional</h2>
<p>If you feel that the risk isn’t immediate — that is, if your friend has had occasional thoughts of suicide but <a href="https://www.sprc.org/sites/default/files/resource-program/After_an_attempt_emotional_impact_of_a_suicide_attempt_on_families.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">doesn’t have a plan</a> to attempt it — t’s still important to offer support. Give them the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number (1-800-273-8255), or you can call the lifeline yourself.</p>
<p>Make a plan with your loved one for how they can access social and mental health support, and help them <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/08/why-working-with-a-therapist-is-different-than-talking-to-a-friend/" target="_blank">reach out to a therapist</a> or medical professional. Connectedness, or feeling close to other people, community, and medical care, is one of the greatest factors in preventing suicide, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/pdf/Suicide_Strategic_Direction_Full_Version-a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">according to the CDC</a>. When talking to your loved one, you can help discover other people in their life who can be present and supportive — friends and family members who will reach out or meet with them regularly, and community resources they can access.</p>
<p>Once you make a plan to support your friend, be sure to stick with it. It’s better to only make promises of support you can keep, than to promise a lot of support or time together that you won’t be able to give. Studies show that <a href="https://stanford.app.box.com/s/kb7alrpx6trlxzyebxm0l8xehxk8ayax" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">following up</a> with people who are suicidal can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11376235" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reduce future attempts</a>, so do your best to remain present and remind your friend that they are loved and valued.</p>
<h2>Take Care of Yourself, Too</h2>
<p>We all want to swoop in like a superhero and rescue our friends from their pain, but the truth is, no one can take on the entirety of someone else’s burden. It’s important not to commit to more than you can truly take on, for both your friend’s health (they shouldn’t feel abandoned if you can’t come through) and for your own. Caring for a loved one who is suicidal is exhausting and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-about-trauma/201601/when-loved-one-attempts-suicide" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">can be traumatic</a>. If your loved one has attempted suicide, and especially if you’ve been a first responder to an event, you need care as well.</p>
<p>Instead of thinking you can do it all yourself, prioritize building support networks for both your friend and yourself. Talking to a trusted friend or therapist about what you’re experiencing can help keep you healthy — ultimately the best thing you can do to support the people you love. We’ve all got to lean on each other, so nourish yourself to help stand tall on solid ground.</p>
<p><i>If you or a loved one are feeling suicidal, there is help. The following hotlines and organizations are there for you, whoever you are and whatever your story.</i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of us were getting together for the first time since graduation, reminiscing about our earlier selves.</p>
<p>“We were all horrible in college,” my friend said recently over drinks. “We were so status-obsessed and trying to keep up with everyone <i>else </i>who was status-obsessed.”</p>
<p>Another friend, sipping his beer, put it more succinctly: “We were all so depressed in college.”</p>
<p>He meant this literally.</p>
<p><span id="more-10674"></span></p>
<h2>Why Anxiety and Depression in College is Prevalent</h2>
<p>It’s not just us. According to recent research, depression and anxiety affect <a href="https://theconversation.com/1-in-5-college-students-have-anxiety-or-depression-heres-why-90440" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">one in five</a> college students. Mental health issues aren’t limited to young people pursuing higher education. In fact, <a href="https://www.self.com/story/depression-rates-teens-young-adults" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">depression is on the rise</a> among young adults in general, with depression among teenagers ages 12-20 increasing from 8.7% in 2005 to 11.3% in 2014. Among young adults ages 18-25, depression increased from 8.8% in 2005 and 9.6% in 2014. This has been tied to various factors, like the increase in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42705881" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">social media use</a> among teens.</p>
<h3>Student Debt is a Major Trigger</h3>
<p>But there’s another major driver of college students’ anxieties: student debt. Researchers have found that the <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/10/25/tuition-and-fees-still-rising-faster-aid-college-board-report-shows" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ever-increasing rise in tuition</a> harms students’ mental health. Student debt can <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahlandrum/2017/10/20/the-impact-of-student-loan-debt-on-millennial-happiness/#7170d8307125" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">dampen a student’s excitement</a> about graduating from college and haunt their post-college plans. With 70% of college students graduating with debt, and the average undergraduate student debt a staggering $33,000, these anxieties are widespread.</p>
<p>That’s bad news for college students’ mental health. One study found that students with more than $25,000 in debt <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/belkin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reported significantly decreased well-being</a> than their counterparts with less debt, and this effect persisted even decades after graduation. The rising cost of tuition has gone hand-in-hand with stunning increases in college student <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/03/599197919/hunger-and-homelessness-are-widespread-among-college-students-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">homelessness,</a> hunger, and economic insecurity, which in turn have a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5775138/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">negative impact on mental health.</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">stagnating wages</a> and the mainstreaming of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/04/22/the-unhappy-rise-of-the-millennial-intern/#1bfea8671328" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">unpaid internship</a> can add an extra burden to students worrying about how they’re going to achieve professional success and put food on the table (if they can afford tables).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/online-therapy-with-a-licensed-therapist?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_MID&amp;utr_adgroup=midpost-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=10674&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/09/lower-high-expectations-in-college/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4880 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png" alt="affordable blog purchase CTA" width="660" height="240" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png 660w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a></p>
<h2>The Mental Cost of Pressures to Succeed</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.jad-journal.com/article/S0165-0327(14)00686-7/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">top three reasons</a> among college students seeking counseling are academic performance, pressure to succeed, and post-graduation plans.</p>
<p>Of course, we all want to work hard, plan for the future, and do our best to succeed. For students with massive debt to repay, failure to obtain a well-paying job after graduation can translate to financial catastrophe. These are big, society-wide problems, and we can’t solve them by addressing our individual mental health.</p>
<p>But we <i>can </i>adopt strategies to keep ourselves healthy in these demanding and precarious environments. That starts with saying bye-bye to unrealistic expectations and practicing <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/5-ways-improve-body-image-confidence-mental-health/" target="_blank">self compassion</a>.</p>
<p>Many of my peers in college used some variation of the phrase: “Work, sleep, or social life: pick two.” Most of us picked work and social life, sleep be damned — including me. In retrospect, I think we all would have been a whole lot healthier, kinder, and — dare I say it? — more productive if we cut down a little on the work part and added a bit more to the sleep part. Hey, <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/sleep-and-mental-health" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">it’s science</a>.</p>
<h2>Begin College by Setting Important Priorities</h2>
<p>As we’re entering higher education, we can ask ourselves: what do I absolutely need to do, what would I like to do, and what can I skip? Getting good grades and learning skills in our chosen field are likely non-negotiable, as is taking some kind of paid work for many students.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/5-ways-exercise-is-great-for-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">exercise</a>, nurturing our relationships with supportive friends, and, yes, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/the-surprising-new-connection-between-sleep-and-mental-health/" target="_blank">sleep</a> should be in the non-negotiable pile, too. If you’re lucky enough to study in a college that provides resources like a free gym, free exercise classes, healthy dining hall options, or subsidized therapy, why not take advantage?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, taking a second internship or a third volunteer opportunity because all your friends are doing it may seem like a good idea, until you’re growling at your boyfriend over tiny stuff, wearing dirty underwear, and falling asleep in class. Saying no to opportunities is hard, but it’s also an important skill for being a real, live adult.</p>
<p>Many of us don’t have the luxury of cutting down on activities like paid work or demanding professional training. But in the areas that you can, lowering your unreasonably high expectations to “reasonably high expectations” for the sake of self-care is a gift to yourself.</p>
<p>It’s also a gift to everyone else in your life, who will get to interact with a caring and fulfilled loved one rather than a stressed-out zombie. I know it’s obnoxious when any older person says this to a college student, but: trust me, you will thank yourself later. Okay, you can roll your eyes now.</p>
<h2>The Benefits of Hard Work and Gratitude</h2>
<p>As for me? I’m grateful for the privileges I received in college, and hope that the experience I accrued in my overachieving, obnoxious zombie years helps me pay off those Millennial student loans.</p>
<p>But as I sat with my friends recently at that bar, I noticed that our faces and laughter are unmistakably happier now than they were back then. Yes, we may be underpaid graduate students and gig economy workers burdened with unreasonable debt. But by god, we get our eight hours of sleep each night.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes depression can sneak up on us, seeping into our lives without detection until it hits hard weeks, months, or even years later. Other times it shows up suddenly, like a heavy, wet blanket that has been thrown on top of us.</p>
<p>Either way, one of depression’s hallmark features is our loss of interest in seemingly <i>everything</i>, whether it’s a favorite pastime or the people closest to you — it can make getting out of bed at all nearly impossible. The world, which once seemed round, flattens out. We’re no longer having any fun and sometimes it’s downright hard to function.</p>
<p>The culprit? In the case of clinical depression, usually it’s a symptom referred to as <b>anhedonia</b>.</p>
<p><span id="more-10620"></span></p>
<h2>Defining Anhedonia</h2>
<p>Anhedonia is defined as a loss of interest or pleasure. Activities we used to enjoy, such as hanging out with friends, eating a good meal, playing board games, watching our favorite TV show, or even having sex are no longer pleasurable. We may feel “flat or empty,” and as a result, have zero <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/maintain-motivation-depressed/" target="_blank">motivation</a> to do anything.</p>
<p>“Anhedonia feels like an endless dribble of dirty dishwater. It feels like a constant gray fog. It’s the experience of the word ‘bleh.’ It’s nothing,” Natasha Tracy writes on her <a href="https://natashatracy.com/bipolar-disorder/bipolar-depression-anhedonia-lack-pleasure-motivation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">blog</a>. “I still have feelings, I guess, but they are so undifferentiated as they are unpunctuated by pleasure, they all feel the same. They all don’t ‘feel.’”</p>
<p>To help lift us out of the gray, people in our lives often invite us to go out and exercise or socialize to feel better. Due to anhedonia’s effect on our <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/ways-stomach-microbiome-impacts-mental-health/" target="_blank">internal reward systems</a>, it’s not always possible to act on these well-meaning offers. We simply don’t have control over our loss of interest, and unfortunately, not being able to engage in pleasurable activities creates a feedback loop.</p>
<p>“It can become a vicious cycle, since anything you could do to improve your mood no longer seems to help, and may sometimes even worsen it since you notice the difference and lack of benefit,” says Dr. Jean Kim, clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at George Washington University. “Anhedonia can be one of the most serious signs of depression.”</p>
<h2>Diagnosing Clinical Depression</h2>
<p>Anhedonia is a symptom of several mental illnesses and neuropsychiatric disorders, including <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/what-is-schizophrenia/" target="_blank">schizophrenia</a>, substance use disorders, some eating/feeding disorders, and even Parkinson’s disease.</p>
<p>Most commonly though, it’s associated with depression. According to the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i>, which is used to diagnose mental illness, anhedonia is indeed one of two “must-have” symptoms in order to determine clinical depression.</p>
<p>“[Anhedonia is] actually one of the key points that distinguish feeling sad or low or having the blues&#8230;from a diagnosable disorder,” says Dr. Simon Rego, chief psychologist at Montefiore Medical Center and associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. “It makes it very difficult to function in either your social life, your work or school life, or in your home, family life.”<br />

<h2>Why Andheonia Makes It Hard To Function</h2>
<p>As for why anhedonia makes it hard to function, we need to look at the brain’s reward system. Though, exactly how anhedonia works or where the process goes awry is still a complicated question researchers haven’t quite figured out the answer to.</p>
<p>In brief, as <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/are-some-people-immune-to-feeling-good" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Science Alert</a> describes, “pleasure is the feeling we get that drives us to seek out a stimulus.” As we find pleasure, our brain’s neurochemistry activates a complex system that drives us to repeat what makes us feel good. For example, we discover that cookies taste awesome, so we go back to the cookie jar over and over.”</p>
<p>“This process is controlled by two main areas of the brain, one that regulates our neurochemistry — the cortico-ventral basal gangli — and another “part of the brain called the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) [that] acts as a traffic cop for pleasurable acts, allowing oh-so-good dopamine levels to rise&#8230;and eliciting a pleasant sensation.”</p>
<p>When we lose interest in activities, several facets of this process may be disrupted. Some <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6268/aac9698" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">recent research</a> suggests that our mPFC “traffic cop” has essentially taken a vacation and decreases its activity level. Other theories point to an imbalance in neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine, one of the “feel good” chemicals in our brain. Additional <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320737.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">research</a> identifies that “GABA (an inhibitory neurotransmitter), glutamate (an excitatory neurotransmitter), serotonin, and opioids may also play their part” in the process.</p>
<p>Long story short, <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320737.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MedicalNewsToday</a> perhaps sums up anhedonia more colloquially: “Something [is] amiss as far as motivation, anticipation, and reward are concerned. For people with anhedonia, the reward process has come unhinged.”</p>
<h2>Getting Help for Loss of Interest</h2>
<p>If any of this sounds familiar and you’ve lost of interest in previously enjoyed activities, reach out for help. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/what-is-crippling-depression/" target="_blank">Clinical depression</a> with anhedonia, if left untreated, can have serious consequences that make it difficult to function in our social, work, and school lives. Know this isn’t your fault — depression is an illness.</p>
<p>“You can&#8217;t get your blood drawn and they say, ‘Oh, this marker is out of range. That&#8217;s why you have depression.’ So it&#8217;s easy then to dismiss it or minimize it as all in your head or stigmatize it….All that is simply untrue,” says Simon Rego. “It&#8217;s important to recognize it&#8217;s a real medical condition and&#8230;it&#8217;s really important, especially if it&#8217;s persisting for at least a couple of weeks, to reach out and get help from a professional.”</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/08/the-different-types-of-therapists-and-counselors-the-complete-guide/" target="_blank">mental health professional</a> — or your family doctor if that’s more comfortable — can address your depression symptoms. If you’re having trouble reaching out for support, ask a loved one if they will help you search for a service provider, make the call, or even take you to your first appointment. Though we may not know everything about what causes depression, it can absolutely be treated.</p>
<p>“Depression, once diagnosed, can be treated with psychotherapy to address life stressors, patterns, and behaviors, and sometimes medication to address the underlying neurobiology in your brain that is triggering depressive symptoms,” says Dr. Jean Kim. “Other helpful ways to manage depressive moods (usually in their milder stages) include reaching out to your support network, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/5-ways-exercise-is-great-for-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">exercise</a>, and decreasing life stressors whenever possible.”</p>
<p>Rego also recommends making sure we take care of the basics. “Keep yourself in a daily rhythm where you try to maintain as best you can a constant wake time, a good bedtime, and try to keep yourself engaged in things, even if they don&#8217;t seem pleasurable,” he says.</p>
<h2>If You’re In Crisis</h2>
<p>Some <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2104515" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">evidence</a> suggests there is a strong link between anhedonia and an increased risk of suicide. If you are having thoughts of killing or harming yourself, it’s an emergency. Reach out to a loved one, call 911, go to the emergency room, or call the <a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a> for immediate help. Your life matters, it can get better, and you’re needed here, alive.</p>
<h2>There’s Hope</h2>
<p>Anhedonia, by definition, takes away the very activities that make life worth living, which can even impair our ability to function on a daily basis. With the support of loved ones and a therapist or psychiatrist as needed, as well as fighting against that loss of interest with self-care and self-love wherever possible, there’s absolutely hope. You won’t feel this way forever.</p>
<p>If you need a little inspiration in the meantime, try the wise words of poet Aberjhani:</p>
<p>“Even when muddy your wings sparkle bright wonders that heal broken worlds.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have all faced moments in our lives where we felt completely inconsolable. Maybe it was after a loss like the death of a loved one — or perhaps after a devastating breakup, job loss, or any other life-change that seemed out of our control and that we grieved deeply.</p>
<p>At times, though, there is no discernible cause: those of us who suffer from depression or anxiety know that sometimes our feelings overwhelm us so intensely that they become hard to shake — and it feels like nothing can console us in those moments.</p>
<p>But what if you are on the other end of such an experience, not suffering from these feelings yourself, but witnessing an inconsolable loved one?</p>
<p><span id="more-10578"></span></p>
<p>By definition, someone who is inconsolable can’t really accept or receive comfort in their state, so it can be difficult to know what to do. You desperately want to make your loved one feel better, to release them of their feelings. But you also know that comforting them too intensely might push them away. In fact, you may have tried to console them, only to find that your efforts were rejected.</p>
<p>So how can you walk the line of supporting your loved one, and also accepting their feelings for what they are? What words of support are actually helpful, and which are not?</p>
<p>While each situation is different — and you will need to “feel out” the person you are consoling to see what works for them and what doesn’t — here are some general tips to make the comfort you are offering more effective and welcomed.</p>
<h2>Don’t Say Anything</h2>
<p>Sometimes — especially when someone is deep in the throes of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/07/are-you-depressed-or-is-something-else-the-problem/" target="_blank">sorrow or grief</a> — the deepest comfort you can offer is your presence. A non-judgmental, listening ear. A shoulder to cry on. Someone who will just “hold space” while your loved one lets it all out.</p>
<h2><b>Reflect Back What You&#8217;re Hearing</b></h2>
<p>If your loved one is allowing you to be present with them, they trust you. One of the greatest gifts you can give them now is empathy. And while you are not going through the exact experience that they are, you might recall times you felt like they did — and you can listen to what they are telling you about their experience. This opens a door for you to help give voice to their feelings and gently add your own perspective.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/online-therapy-with-a-licensed-therapist?utr_source=Blog&#038;utr_medium=CPC&#038;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_MID&#038;utr_adgroup=midpost-cta&#038;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&#038;WPpost_id=10578&#038;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/what-to-say-to-someone-when-theyre-inconsolable/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4858 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/darkblue_toughtime.png" alt="tough time blog purchase CTA" width="660" height="240" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/darkblue_toughtime.png 660w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/darkblue_toughtime-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
If your loved one has lost a family member, instead of saying, “I’m so sorry for your loss,” you might consider something like, “Losing a loved one can hurt so deeply. It sounds like you are feeling like your world is coming apart right now. I’ve been there; I understand. It is such a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/losing-my-best-friend-a-pain-without-name/" target="_blank">devastating loss</a>, and my heart is breaking for you.”</p>
<h2><b>Ask Questions</b></h2>
<p>You might have a million and one ideas about what would make your loved one feel better, and that’s very kind, but it may not be the best approach here. When someone is inconsolable, it can be hard to listen to others’ ideas. Your opinions have a tendency to come across as judgments or directives and can be hard to hear. Instead, turn your thoughts into questions.</p>
<p>For example, if you think your loved one would feel better if they took a walk outside, say, “Do you think there are any activities we could do today that might bring you some relief?” This way, your loved one feels like they are in control, and can come up with idea themselves (or even ask you for suggestions!). Or, they can reject the idea, but on their own terms.</p>
<h2><b>Stay Positive</b></h2>
<p>One the one hand, you want to remind your loved one that “this too shall pass,” but you also don’t want them to feel like their <i>very real</i> feelings are somehow invalid. So while you want to add <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/7-secrets-of-highly-resilient-people/" target="_blank">positivity</a> to their lives, you want to do so with discretion.</p>
<p>Rather than saying, “You’ll feel better tomorrow,” you might consider something like, “I know how much you are suffering today. Tomorrow is a new day, and I hope you will experience some relief soon.”</p>
<p>This being said, if your loved one is inconsolable to a point where you are concerned for their well-being, or if they are exhibiting signs of possible self-harm, do not hesitate to intervene and get them help right away. And if the feelings of inconsolability seem to last beyond a reasonable amount of time (inconsolable feelings lasting months or years, may actually be considered <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/finding-help-complicated-grief/">complicated grief</a> and require a different treatment regimen), you might consider suggesting professional help via counseling or therapy.</p>
<p>For many situations, however, one of the most powerful comforts you can give to someone who is suffering inconsolably is simply your loving presence, a few words of compassion, and a whole lot of hugs. You need to let your loved one heal on their own timetable, which may be longer than your expectations. After all, what you want more than anything is for your loved one to feel better.</p>
<p>But remember that what you are doing really <i>is</i> necessary. None of us can get through difficult times alone, and your love and comfort does a world of good, even if the results might not be seen immediately.</p>
