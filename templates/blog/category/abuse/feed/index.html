				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While abuse is often stereotypically portrayed in only one manner, as physical violence, there are actually several types of domestic violence.</p>
<p>Domestic violence is a problem that affects millions of people in all types of relationships — traditional marriages, same-sex partnerships, and relationships where there is no sexual intimacy involved. The United States Department of Justice defines domestic violence as “a pattern of abusive behavior in any relationship that is used by one partner to gain or maintain power and control over another intimate partner.”</p>
<p><span id="more-11197"></span></p>
<h2>The Types of Domestic Violence</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ovw/domestic-violence" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">U.S. DOJ</a>, five types of domestic violence exist, and each has a devastating effect on those involved — including witnesses of the abuse. These include:</p>
<h3>Physical violence</h3>
<p>The use of physical force against another. Examples include hitting, shoving, grabbing, biting, restraining, shaking, choking, burning, forcing the use of drug/alcohol, and assault with a weapon. Physical violence may or may not result in an injury that requires medical attention.</p>
<h3>Sexual violence</h3>
<p>The violation of an individual’s bodily integrity (<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/04/coping-with-sexual-assault-or-picking-up-the-pieces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexual assault</a>), including coercing sexual contact, rape and prostitution, as well as any unwelcome sexual behavior (sexual harassment), including treating someone in a sexually demeaning manner or any other conduct of a sexual nature, whether physical, verbal or non-verbal. Sexual abuse also includes behavior, which limits reproductive rights, such as preventing use of contractive methods and forcing abortion.</p>
<h3>Economic abuse</h3>
<p>Making or attempting to make the victim financially dependent on the abuser. Examples of this include preventing or forbidding an intimate partner from working or gaining an education, controlling the financial resources and withholding access to economic resources.</p>
<h3>Psychological abuse</h3>
<p>Intimidation, threats of harm and isolation. Examples include instilling fear in an intimate partner through threatening behavior, such as damaging property or abusing pets, constant supervision or controlling what the victim does and who they talk to.</p>
<p>Further, spiritual abuse may be included as a type of psychological abuse. It involves the misuse of spiritual or religious beliefs to manipulate or exert power and control over an intimate partner. For example, using scripture to justify abuse or rearing the children in a faith or religious practice the partner has not agreed to.</p>
<h3>Emotional abuse</h3>
<p>Undermining an individual’s sense of self-worth. Examples of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/how-to-recognize-emotional-abuse-in-intimate-relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emotional abuse</a> include constant criticism, name-calling, embarrassing, mocking and humiliating.</p>
<h2>How to Recognize Domestic Abuse</h2>
<p>These types of domestic abuse have many shades and variations, carefully customized by the abuser to use in his or her quest for power and control. Warning signs that a relationship may be abusive include a partner who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Makes you feel like you’re never right</li>
<li>Is unreasonably jealous of other relationships</li>
<li>Questions time you spend away from them</li>
<li>Discourages other relationships, including with family</li>
<li>Shames you</li>
<li>Frightens you</li>
<li>Makes you feel like you can’t make decisions</li>
<li>Controls your actions and/or finances</li>
<li>Threatens your children or pets, or hurts them</li>
<li>Sexually mistreats you, or pushes you into sexual acts you’re not comfortable with</li>
<li>Physically threatens you, or hurts you</li>
</ul>
<p>Family and friends can also help identify abuse by addressing changes in a loved one’s behavior, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Inconsistent explanations:</b> Victims may provide different excuses for the causes of their injuries due to fear of alerting others to the severity of their situation.</li>
<li><b>Alcohol abuse:</b> Victims may use alcohol or other substances as a means to escape from their everyday reality of abuse.</li>
<li><b>Visible injuries:</b> Bruises are the most common form of injury and turn purple to green to yellow as they heal.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Get Help</h2>
<p>A common misconception surrounding these types of domestic violence is that the victim is not strong enough to leave, but it’s far more complex than that. Walking away from an abusive relationship is a process more than a single action. Victims usually make several attempts before they leave the abuser for good. That’s why community support is so important.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know has experienced domestic violence, you are not alone. These three resources are just some of many that can help victims and survivors of domestic violence find support and assistance in their communities.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thehotline.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">National Domestic Violence Hotline</a> (800-799-7233): Open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, this line is a resource for safety information and can connect any caller with shelters and protection advocates in her area.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://vinelink.com/#/home" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">VINE:</a> Active in 47 states, VINE allows victims to search for an offender in custody by name or identification number, then register to be alerted if the offender has been released or transferred, or has escaped.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.womenslaw.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Women’s Law</a>: This site has state-by-state legal information and resources for victims, as well as advice on how to leave an abusive situation, gather evidence of abuse, and prepare for court.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Remember, You Come First</h2>
<p>If you’re trying to decide whether to stay or leave, you may be feeling confused, uncertain, frightened, and torn. One moment, you may desperately want to get away, and the next, you may want to hang on to the relationship. Maybe you even blame yourself for the abuse or feel weak and embarrassed because you’ve stuck around in spite of it.</p>
<p>Don’t be trapped by confusion, guilt, or self-blame. The only thing that matters is your safety or the safety of the victim you are concerned about. Focus on getting help and protecting yourself and those around you who are being impacted by these types of domestic violence.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, a man I know was outed as a serial sexual harasser. I say “know” in a rather unfortunate sense: I’d been approached online by, went on a date with, and even kissed the guy a couple years ago. His too-forward sexual advances had always left a bad taste in my mouth.</p>
<p>When the revelations went live, with dozens of women telling stories of his disrespectful and aggressive behavior, I felt happy he was exposed, yet ashamed I hadn’t listened to my gut instincts. I blamed myself for overlooking his boorish behavior and letting my hope that he could end up being a decent guy take precedence over the warning bells clanging in my head.</p>
<p>Giving that man the benefit of the doubt was not my fault. And if you’ve stayed with an <a href="https://everydayfeminism.com/2016/03/still-love-abusive-partner/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">abusive partner</a>, or even given a guy a second chance after he harassed you, it’s not your fault, either. The pressure to be kind, generous, and forgiving — especially as women — is drummed into our heads from birth.</p>
<p><span id="more-11193"></span></p>
<p>So often, we are trained to prioritize other people’s feelings over our preferences, comfort, and even safety. When it comes to abusive relationships specifically, so many factors — from financial dependence, to reduced self-confidence, to believing our partners can change — can keep us from leaving.</p>
<p>It’s okay to have complex feelings for someone who has harassed or abused you. However, abuse is never the abused person’s fault. It is always the fault of the abuser, who takes advantage of a victim’s trust to hurt them. Victims can’t change abusers, and it’s not healthy or safe to try.</p>
<p>We <i>can</i>, however, care for ourselves, and decide what we need to be happy, healthy, and to live free of emotional, sexual, and physical violence.</p>
<h2>Why Do Victims Stay in Abusive Relationships?</h2>
<p>If you haven’t been in an abusive relationship, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/12/why-doesnt-my-friend-leave-their-abusive-partner-and-how-can-i-help/">it can be difficult</a> to understand how complex abuse dynamics can be. After all, if someone is being verbally, emotionally, sexually, or physically abused, wouldn’t their first impulse be to get as far away from the abuser as possible?</p>
<p>It’s a little more <a href="https://www.thehotline.org/is-this-abuse/why-do-people-stay-in-abusive-relationships/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">complicated</a> than that. Sometimes, abuse victims really want to leave, but they simply can’t. They may be financially dependent on their abusive partners, or may fear that they’ll lose custody of their children. They may also be genuinely afraid for their safety, and even their lives. Research shows that victims are at the highest risk of intimate partner homicide when they try to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/oct/20/domestic-private-violence-women-men-abuse-hbo-ray-rice" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">leave</a>.</p>
<p>While people who have never been in such situations may insensitively say that staying is irrational, these are in reality all rational, understandable reactions to a dangerous and devastating situation. All survivors, <a href="https://www.thehotline.org/2017/02/16/supporting-someone-returning-to-abusive-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">whether they leave or not</a>, and however they feel about their abusers, deserve support and respect.</p>
<h2>Emotional Abuse Can Make it Difficult to Move On</h2>
<p>Abusive relationships are about control, and that includes control of victims’ emotions through <a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/relationships-and-safety/other-types/emotional-and-verbal-abuse" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">psychological abuse</a> and gaslighting. Abusive partners may manipulate victims through threats, coercion, or sweet talk.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.domesticviolenceroundtable.org/domestic-violence-cycle.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Abusive cycles</a> can include a “honeymoon phase,” when the abusive partner apologizes for past violence, promises they won’t repeat their behavior, and treats their partner kindly. The abusive partner may genuinely feel remorse for their actions and intend to keep these promises. But without a sustained commitment to change, hard work, and psychological support, they often <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/abusive-partner-promises-change/">fall back into old patterns</a>, making it unsafe for the victim to stay with them and making these promises another form of control.</p>
<p>This cycle often works through the physiological and psychological experience of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trauma-bonding-explains-why-people-often-stay-in-abusive-relationships-2017-8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">trauma bonding</a>. Abusive relationships can be incredibly intense, with the abused person cycling between searing pain when the abuser hurts or degrades them, and deep joy when the abuser chooses to be kind. This cycle of reward and punishment can lead victims to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/neurosagacity/201701/the-brain-can-work-against-abuse-victims" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">rationalize abuse</a> and try hard to please the abusive partner — even as the abusive partner continues to hurt them.</p>
<p>Finally, as difficult as it may be for people who haven’t experienced abuse to understand, abusive relationships are <a href="https://www.thehotline.org/2016/09/21/why-do-i-love-my-abuser/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">still relationships</a>. Like any other relationship, they can contain moments of intimacy, sweetness, and support.</p>
<p>Unlike a healthy relationship, however, in an abusive relationship, these moments of intimacy are part of a broader cycle of control. They often give the victim false hope that things will get better in the future. While this hope is sadly often misguided, it’s also a real feeling, and abuse victims deserve the space and time to mourn what their relationships meant to them, just like anyone else.</p>
<h2>No Matter How You Feel About Your Abuser, You Deserve Support</h2>
<p>Complex feelings are normal and human, and having complex feelings toward abusive partners isn’t wrong or bad. The truth is, you deserve support and care no matter how you feel about your abuser. And while we can’t change our abusers, and for our own safety shouldn’t try, we can advocate for ourselves and seek the care we need to be healthy and safe.</p>
<p>If you’re currently in an abusive relationship, you can seek support from loved ones, mental health professionals, and domestic violence resource centers like the <a href="https://www.thehotline.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">National Domestic Violence Hotline</a>. You can also find resources on <a href="https://www.thehotline.org/help/path-to-safety/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">making a plan</a> to keep yourself safe.</p>
<p>If you’ve left an abusive relationship and are struggling with past trauma or complex feelings about the abuse (including still having feelings for the person who abused you), it’s a good idea to seek out therapy and support from sympathetic loved ones, survivors’ groups, and victim hotlines.</p>
<p>From online harassers demanding dates to an abusive spouse promising yet again that they’ll change, it’s normal to want to think the best of other people. These feelings don’t make us wrong or bad, they make us human. Rather than judging survivors for having complex feelings toward abusers, we can offer survivors — including ourselves — the compassionate support that truly empowers us to have healthier futures.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The day after Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testified before congress about her experience of sexual violence in relation to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN) received the <a href="https://www.rainn.org/news/rainn-hotline-helps-record-number-survivors" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">highest number of calls</a> in its 24-year history. More than 3,000 people connected with the network on September 28, part of a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-harassment-helplines/metoo-effect-calls-flood-u-s-sexual-assault-hotlines-idUSKBN1F6194" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">record-breaking increase</a> in the number of survivors of sexual violence requesting services since the #MeToo movement began last year.</p>
<p>The outpouring of truth and support has been unprecedented. As countless survivors finally see their experiences reflected in the national conversation, we feel a moment of hope for renewed connection and healing. But this hope is accompanied by pain, as many survivors who do come forward experience backlash. Additionally, survivors have been increasingly exposed to potentially triggering, and seemingly inescapable news around recent, high-profile incidents sexual violence.</p>
<p><span id="more-11179"></span></p>
<h2>Sexual Violence Affects Every Aspect of Survivors’ Lives</h2>
<p>From street harassment to sexual abuse, all forms of nonconsensual sexual attention can have a negative effect on our mental health. Sexual objectification, or any act that dehumanizes us through our sexualities, can <a href="https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/appsych/opus/issues/2016/spring/rooney" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">make us anxious</a>, increase our risk of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depression</a>, and decrease our comfort in our bodies, leading to increased risk of eating disorders. Survivors of sexual violence face substantial mental health barriers, with <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-associated-with-sexual-assault-among-women-in-the-who-world-mental-health-surveys/24319B83A9DF92E8D7E3512041B2B059" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">20% of rape survivors</a> developing PTSD.</p>
<p>These negative mental health effects impact all aspects of survivors’ lives. Street harassment, for example, makes us <a href="http://genprogress.org/voices/2015/11/25/41304/millennials-face-long-term-effects-from-street-harassment/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">alter our paths</a> through the world, limiting where we feel safe. Sexual violence, meanwhile, costs us more than just our wellbeing: between health bills and lost time at work, survivors of sexual violence suffer an average <a href="http://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/nsvrc_talking-points_lifetime-economic-burden_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lifetime financial burden</a> of $122,461. Meanwhile, people who experience intimate partner violence (IPV) in their adolescence obtain <a href="https://iwpr.org/publications/economic-cost-intimate-partner-violence-sexual-assault-stalking/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">0.5 years less education</a> than people who have never experienced IPV.</p>
<p>In the face of this very concrete harm to survivors’ wellbeing, caring for our mental health through social support, wellness, and therapy is vital. Psychological research shows that positive and affirming <a href="https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1114&amp;context=crvaw_facpub" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">social support</a> is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2323517/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">crucial</a> in helping survivors of sexual assault and intimate partner violence heal. Meanwhile, survivors with an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3305196/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">increased sense of empowerment</a> have a reduced risk of being victimized in the future.</p>
<p>Despite its more recent appropriation as a form of pampering, the concept of “<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/when-self-care-becomes-problematic/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">self-care</a>” actually <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2017/04/the_history_of_self_care.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">originated</a> among feminists, rights activists, health workers, and other people who experienced trauma as part of their work, or simply as part of living in an unjust world. Self-care was a way for them to assert their value in a society that devalued them. For survivors of sexual harassment, abuse, and assault — and for all women, who experience sexism in our everyday lives — nurturing our mental health is self-care in this original, revolutionary sense. Caring for our mental health is an act of courage and a commitment to our own thriving. As #MeToo continues, it’s more important than ever.</p>
<h2>We’re in It Together</h2>
<p>It seemed like every time I opened my computer to get started on this article, another #MeToo revelation crossed my social media feed. I’d get another message from a friend struggling with their own memories, or I was hit with another memory of my own. With so many people in our lives sharing pent-up trauma, it can feel like there’s no one to turn to for <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/07/how-to-best-support-a-survivor-of-sexual-assault/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support</a>. Yet in reality, the pervasiveness of #MeToo is precisely its strength: we are in this together.</p>
<p>If the news has you feeling overwhelmed, you are not alone. There is no “right way” to be a survivor or to deal with whatever you’re feeling right now. Instead, it’s important to care for yourself, exactly the way you need to. If that means turning off the news entirely, that’s perfect. If that means sharing your experiences publicly, that’s great, too. Caring for yourself is an act of courage — whether you march in the streets, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talk to a therapist</a>, or cuddle up in bed.</p>
<p>And while every survivor is different, the #MeToo moment has shown us one truth that applies to everyone: no matter who you are or what you’ve experienced, you are not alone.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an effort to raise awareness about domestic violence in the U.S. and across the globe, October has been designated Domestic Violence Awareness Month. This time of the year is an opportunity to deepen our understanding of these issues, share resources, and most importantly, support survivors. But, while it’s a great time to do so, it isn’t the only time.</p>
<p><span id="more-11173"></span></p>
<h2>Domestic Violence Awareness Month — How Far We’ve Come</h2>
<p>Since the <a href="https://www.legalmomentum.org/history-vawa" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Violence Against Women Act</a> passed in 1994, justice for women in abusive situations has strengthened. This landmark legislation, led by then-Senator Joe Biden, combined new provisions that hold offenders accountable and provide programs and services for victims.</p>
<p>For example, the act led to the creation of the Office on Violence Against Women, whose 25 grant programs support domestic violence shelters, sexual assault crisis centers and hotlines, and legal support for victims, among many other programs. As a result, between 1994 and 2010, the overall rate of domestic violence <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=4536" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">dropped nearly two-thirds</a>, and state laws have reformed to address issues such as dating abuse in the workplace, stalking, employment discrimination and more.</p>
<p>While we’ve made strides, there’s still much to be done, and Domestic Violence Awareness Month is a great time to realign and focus on these issues. We continue to be flooded with news stories about domestic violence, from <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-rate-of-domestic-violence-arrests-among-nfl-players/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">athletes beating their significant others</a> in <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/08/ray-rice-punch-video_n_5783380.html?utm_hp_ref=sports" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">public elevators</a> to <a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/celebrities-charged-with-domestic-abuse/celebrity-lists" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">celebrities publicly abusing their girlfriends</a>.</p>
<p>This problem is not one that will go away quickly or quietly. Domestic violence continues to <a href="https://ncadv.org/statistics" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">affect millions</a>, both women and men, of every race, religion, culture and status. Thirty-five percent of women worldwide have experienced either physical or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence (or a combination), according to the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/chapter6/chapter6.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">United Nations</a>.</p>
<h2>How You Can Make a Difference Before, During, and After Domestic Violence Awareness Month</h2>
<p>If you know or suspect that someone is a victim of domestic violence, you might feel clueless about the best way to help. But don’t let fear of saying the wrong thing prevent you from reaching out. And, if you don’t have any personal reasons to help, don’t think you have to sit on the sideline.</p>
<p>The world for many <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/5-celebrity-women-spoke-domestic-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">domestic abuse victims</a> can be lonely, isolated, and filled with fear. Knowing there are people out there willing to help them can provide tremendous relief. Here are a few ways to get involved:</p>
<h3>March to heighten awareness about domestic violence</h3>
<p>Hundreds of the cities have marches or rallies for the cause in the month of October. Many include a drumming circle and candlelight vigils honoring victims and survivors of domestic violence. Check out local events near you and plan to get involved.</p>
<h3>Educate yourself on the signs of abuse</h3>
<p>Rarely, if ever, do we hear about domestic abuse from our friends — even though statistically we may know plenty of people who have suffered domestic abuse. Educating yourself on the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/is-it-a-normal-fight-or-verbal-abuse-heres-how-to-tell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signs of abuse</a> might save a friend or family member’s life. Here are a few of the signs that medical professionals say to <a href="http://www.newhopeforwomen.org/abuser-tricks" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">watch out for</a>.</p>
<h3>Be a source of comfort</h3>
<p>You don’t have to be an expert to make a difference — you just have to be yourself. If someone shares their experience with you, it’s because you are a person they look to for support, compassion, and guidance. Although you can’t take away what happened to someone, you can be a source of comfort.</p>
<h3>Donate whatever goods you can</h3>
<p>Domestic violence survivors who leave an abuser often have little more than the clothes on their backs. In fact, domestic violence is one of the leading causes of homelessness for families across the nation. Donations of cash or household goods, uniforms, toys and small appliances can make a big difference.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="http://www.thehotline.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">National Domestic Hotline</a> is looking for donations of financial contributions and old cell phones. If you shop online, you can also click a button that will automatically donate a small portion of your purchase to the cause through Amazon Smile and Ebay Giving Works Program. Similarly, the <a href="http://www.ncadv.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">National Coalition Against Domestic Violence</a> is looking for financial contributions and old cell phones, and offers a shop with items displaying their logo to raise awareness. Also, check with your local shelter to see how you can help.</p>
<h2>Remember, You Don’t Have to Suffer Alone</h2>
<p>If you are a victim of abuse or violence at the hands of someone you know or love, or you are recovering from an assault by a stranger, you are not alone. Get immediate help and support.</p>
<p>The National Domestic Violence Hotline can be reached 24 hours a day, seven days a week at (800) 799-SAFE (7233).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“I promise I’ll change.”</p>
<p>These are four words most people in a relationship with an abusive partner have probably heard. Longed-for yet dreaded, the words can offer both hope and disappointment. Hope that things really will get better this time, and disappointment when, inevitably, the abusive behavior—whether emotional, physical, or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/is-it-a-normal-fight-or-verbal-abuse-heres-how-to-tell/" target="_blank">verbal</a>—begins all over again.</p>
<p>We’ve all heard that a leopard can’t change its spots. But what about an abusive partner?</p>
<p><span id="more-9366"></span></p>
<h2>Are Abusive Partners Capable of Real Change?</h2>
<p>Many experts say it <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hurt-people-hurt-people/201511/abusive-partners-can-change" target="_blank"><i>is </i>possible</a> for abusive partners to change. Yet false promises to change are often a way to keep victims in abusive relationships. So how do you know when a pledge to change is real—and when it’s just an empty promise?</p>
<p>The truth is, there’s <a href="http://www.thehotline.org/2010/09/08/expecting-magic-from-abuser-programs/" target="_blank">no magical formula</a> to make an abusive person change. And as much as you may care about your partner and wish things were different, no one can “make” anyone else change at all—they have to do that for themselves. But there are <a href="https://www.domesticshelters.org/domestic-violence-articles-information/can-he-change#.WqedO5NuaT8" target="_blank">signs</a> we can look for to tell a false promise from a real effort. Ultimately, real accountability begins when the abusive partner acknowledges their abuse, genuinely commits to changing, and prioritizes the feelings, experiences, and desires of their victims over themselves.</p>
<p>While change is possible, it’s hard to do and it takes a lot of time. If you’ve been in an abusive relationship, remember: You deserve safety, respect, and love. You can’t <a href="http://www.loveisrespect.org/content/can-i-save-them/" target="_blank">make anybody else change</a>. But you can care for yourself. You can decide what you need to lead a happy, healthy, and free life, including whether, when, and how to leave the relationship. And you can love yourself with all the patience, passion, and ferocity with which you love others. You deserve it.</p>
<h2><b>Promises and the Cycle of Abuse</b></h2>
<p>If someone is cruel or violent to you all the time, it’s easy to recognize that the relationship just isn’t right. But what most people who haven’t been in an abusive relationship fail to understand is that abusers aren’t necessarily cruel or violent all the time. They can also have moments where they act charming, sweet, and kind — one of the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/12/why-doesnt-my-friend-leave-their-abusive-partner-and-how-can-i-help/" target="_blank">reasons</a> why abuse victims stay.</p>
<p>The promise of change can fill the abused partner with hope that maybe, this time, things will get better. Hope is a beautiful thing and wanting a relationship to get better isn’t foolish or shameful — it’s a testament to your optimism and resilience. But sadly, without serious intervention, no matter what the abusive partner promises the <a href="http://www.center4research.org/cycle-domestic-violence/" target="_blank">cycle</a> of <a href="http://domesticviolence.org/violence-wheel/" target="_blank">abuse</a> will likely continue.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s important to focus not only on what abusive partners say, but what they do. Change is possible, but it’s <i>hard</i>. When an abusive partner continues to put themselves first, blame you, or put you down, unfortunately their promises to change are just a way to maintain control. And your love, optimism, and resilience may be better spent on <i>yourself</i>, by giving yourself all the love, care, and promise of a healthy future that you truly deserve.</p>
<h2>How to Recognize an Abusive Partner’s Commitment To Change</h2>
<p>So when <i>can </i>real change happen?</p>
<p>Abusive behavior is learned over time, often having to do with past trauma or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/sep/17/breaking-the-cycle-of-abuse" target="_blank">childhood role models</a> who were abusive. And especially for men, dominating and violent behaviors are rewarded by society at large through <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/how-men-can-confront-toxic-masculinity-why-its-important-for-mental-health/" target="_blank">toxic masculinity</a>. Unlearning these behaviors is difficult, and it only happens when the abusive person fully commits to giving up their abusive patterns and learning new ones.</p>
<p>The first sign of a real commitment? Abusive partners stop centering themselves and start feeling true empathy for their victims. They will genuinely recognize the harm they caused to another living, breathing human being, will take responsibility for the abuse, and will participate in any process the victim wishes to enact for accountability — or respect the victim’s desire for no contact at all. Finally, the abuser <i>definitely</i> won’t expect any kind of reward or commendation for “good behavior.” After all, not being abusive shouldn’t win you a medal — it’s basic human decency.</p>
<p>But just wanting to change isn’t enough. The process of genuinely changing harmful behaviors is long, slow, and difficult. It takes a lifetime to learn abusive behaviors, so unlearning those behaviors — while totally possible — takes a heck of a lot of work.</p>
<p>This work can happen in <a href="http://www.thehotline.org/2014/07/03/intervention-programs-for-abusive-behavior/" target="_blank">intervention programs</a> specifically designed to help abusive partners recognize their abuse patterns and learn new, healthy patterns. Abusers who really want to change will also address other problems — like depression or alcoholism — by seeking real, long-term help.</p>
<h2>The Survivor Comes First</h2>
<p>Sometimes pop songs are right: Love really <i>can</i> feel like a battlefield. But it shouldn’t have to. While it’s totally natural to want to help abusive partners change, the truth is that victims can’t bear such an unfair and exhausting burden. Because love shouldn’t be a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjY_uSSncQw" target="_blank">battlefield</a> or even a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrLk4vdY28Q" target="_blank">cold and broken hallelujah</a>, it should be a source of support, joy, and nourishment in a difficult world.</p>
<p>So wherever you are in your own relationship, remember that you deserve all good things and more. You can’t make anyone keep their promise to change. But you sure as heck can keep a promise to love, honor, and care for yourself.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even the most dynamic of duos has the occasional fight. Whether it begins with &#8220;Who forgot to take the dog out?&#8221; or &#8220;Do I <em>really </em>have to go to your brother&#8217;s birthday party?&#8221;, having arguments is a common — and healthy — part of any relationship.</p>
<p>But in some cases, what we call an “argument” is actually something worse. Ever had a partner who criticizes everything you do? Who shouts and uses cruel language when they get angry (and they may fly off the handle a lot)? Who makes you feel like you’re wrong or “too sensitive” when you try to speak up?</p>
<p><span id="more-9220"></span></p>
<p>That’s not a normal argument. That’s verbal abuse.</p>
<p>Many of us know the signs of physical abuse. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/how-to-recognize-emotional-abuse-in-intimate-relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">But verbal abuse, on the other hand, can be trickier to spot</a> because we’re just not taught to look for it. As the childhood rhyme teaches us: Sticks and stones may break your bones but words can never hurt you.</p>
<p>But words can hurt — badly. No kind of abuse is okay, and verbal abuse can devastate a victim’s emotional and mental health, not to mention escalate to other kinds of violence. So how can you tell the difference between the occasional lost temper and verbal abuse? It’s all about the power dynamic.</p>
<h2>What is Verbal Abuse, Really?</h2>
<p>Verbal abuse is what it sounds like: The use of words to control and hurt someone. Some kinds of verbal abuse are more obvious, like using swear words or yelling. But four-letter words aren’t the only kind that can hurt. In fact, verbal abusers can cause a lot of damage with underhanded comments or even with silent treatments.</p>
<p>Many people struggle with what constitutes verbal abuse, but here’s how to tell whether your partner’s comments are part of a healthy argument — or verbally abusive.</p>
<ul>
<li>They’re unwanted. It’s not a conversation, it’s an attack.</li>
<li>They’re unequal. One partner uses language to dominate the other.</li>
<li>They’re harmful. Comments are meant to damage the self-esteem, confidence, or sense of reality of the victim.</li>
<li>They’re continuous.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a healthy relationship, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/best-way-fight-partner-according-therapist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conflict is equal and respectful</a>. Verbal abuse, on the other hand, is an ongoing pattern of criticism from one person. It may be part of an cycle wherein the abuser is sometimes sweet and loving — but always returns to their hurtful ways.</p>
<h2>What are Some Forms of Verbal Abuse?</h2>
<p>There’s no one-size-fits-all formula for figuring out whether something is verbally abusive. But we all have that little voice in our heads that tells us when something just isn’t right. Listen to it! And if your partner’s behavior fits any of the below patterns, it’s not just a “normal” conflict.</p>
<p><strong>1. Gaslighting</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/09/what-is-gaslighting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In gaslighting</a>, the abuser tries to control the victim’s sense of reality. The abuser may call the victim irrational or crazy or convince them that things that really did happen didn’t. Gaslighting is dangerous because the victim may come to accept their partners’ version of reality, and therefore believe that the abuse isn’t really happening or that it’s justified.</p>
<p><strong>2. Threats and Intimidation</strong></p>
<p>These are a little easier to spot and should be taken seriously. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/signs-youre-in-a-toxic-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">If your partner ever threatens you with physical violence</a> (“If you keep complaining I’ll give you something to really complain about”), public humiliation (“I’ll tell everyone that you slept with him”), or threatens to hurt themselves or people around you, get help. Emotional threats can be equally harmful. For example, a partner may threaten to leave you in order to control things only you get to have a say in, like what you wear or eat.</p>
<p><strong>3. Undermining and Trivialization</strong></p>
<p>Verbal abusers may try to undermine their victim’s sense of self, opinions or feelings. For example, the abuser may tell the victim they only got a promotion because the boss thinks they&#8217;re sexy or may correct every little thing they do. Abusers may trivialize their victim’s feelings by calling them “too sensitive” or telling them they’re just exaggerating.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Be Afraid to Reach Out</h2>
<p>You deserve respect and care just for being you, and if your partner is trying to tear you down in any way, including being verbally abusive, that behavior (and hey, probably that partner) needs to be kicked to the curb.</p>
<p>So don’t be afraid to reach out for help, because it’s never “just words.” Talk to a friend you know won’t judge you or a family member who has been through it and come out the other side. <a href="http://www.thehotline.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call a hotline</a> or see a therapist who works with clients who’ve experienced abuse.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon to equivocate over what constitutes verbal abuse, mainly because the hurtful words of a verbal abuser have a way of worming into our heads and staying there, replacing our own thoughts with their voice. But your voice is strong and true, and no one else has the right to take it away from you. Let it sing through.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The summer I was nineteen, I researched and wrote a travel guide to Italy, journeying from Venice to the Cinque Terre armed only with a sundress and my handy dandy Macbook.</p>
<p>It sounds pretty ideal, and it was—except for the constant, terrifying, enraging sexual harassment. From being groped on the train to being kissed non-consensually by hostel owners and bartenders, the summer left me tan, skinny, with killer calf muscles — and with a feeling of total disconnect from my sexuality. After months of constant, unwanted attention and physical violation, I felt that my sexuality had become a weapon used against me rather than something for my own pleasure.</p>
<p><span id="more-8885"></span></p>
<p>My experience is not rare. From street harassment to rape, many of us, and particularly women and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/the-pain-of-anti-lgbtq-bullying-ending-the-silence/" target="_blank">LGBTQ people,</a> are affected by sexual violence. And because sexual violence is a violation of our right to make choices about our bodies, it can change our relationship to our own sexuality in complex and difficult ways.</p>
<p>Experiencing sexual intimacy after violence may take time and the process of healing comes with lots of bumps in the road. But healing is possible, and you have a right to feel that your body is your home. In this post, I&#8217;ll offer some ways to start.</p>
<h2>It’s often difficult for survivors to engage sexually after trauma.</h2>
<p>Trauma is a complex beast, so it affects our sexualities in diverse and individual ways. These effects may show up right away, or years down the line. Some trauma-related symptoms you might experience include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoiding sex or feeling a lack of physical desire even when you’d like to<br />
Feeling out of control of your sexuality, which may include doing sexual things you don’t feel good about</li>
<li>Feeling distant or alienated during sex</li>
<li>Feeling uncomfortable, fearful, angry or disgusted by touch</li>
<li>Experiencing physical/genital pain related to psychological distress</li>
<li>Being triggered or experiencing flashbacks in response to particular kinds of touch, words, or scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p>Survivors of sexual trauma are at an increased risk of a number of psychological conditions, like depression, anxiety, and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These can all affect your sex life. This is why it’s so important to find the support you deserve, from family and friends you trust and from a therapist sensitive to issues of gender and sexual violence.</p>
<h2>The key? Listen to your body.</h2>
<p>Whether and how you have sex should always be your choice. After experiencing sexual violence, you may want to have sex like you did before, only in certain ways, or not at all. All of this is okay. If, when, and how you have sex, it should be because you choose it, not because you feel you should or someone else pressures you.</p>
<p>And remember that if you don’t want to have sex, this doesn’t mean missing out on intimacy. There are many different ways to be physically and emotionally intimate with people you care about and to experience pleasure (cuddling, massage, or sumptuous romantic dinners, for example) whatever your desire for genital sexual intimacy.</p>
<p>Here are some ways you can begin connecting to your body again on your own terms, and engaging sexually if (and only if!) you so desire.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Notice sensations, needs, desires — in your body.<br />
</strong>I know it’s hard to do that when that voice inside you feels lost and when the body has become a place of pain rather than of pleasure, but begin to listen to what your body wants. Start small. Pay attention to when you’re hungry and eat foods that you love. Pay attention to when your body wants to move and do kinds of physical activity that give you pleasure. Get enough sleep. Wear clothes that make you feel good.</li>
<li><strong>Think about what kinds of touch feel good, bad, or triggering</strong>.<br />
Begin experiencing touch in different ways: Feel what shower or bath water is like on your skin. Enjoy holding hands or hugging, if that feels good. You don’t have to think of touch as sexual at first or ever — the aim here is to begin to connect to what feels good to you.</li>
<li><strong>If you feel able, you can begin to explore erotic materials that you enjoy.</strong><br />
For example, reading erotica about scenarios that you feel turned on by. Pay attention to what scenarios, words, or kinds of touch make you feel good, bad, or trigger you. If you’re ready to explore sexual touch, masturbate.</li>
<li><strong>If you’re with a partner, now would be the time to have a conversation about your experiences of violence and what that might mean for intimacy.</strong><br />
This could mean simply mentioning that you’ve experienced violence and need to go slow, or could be a precise detailing of your experiences and needs. Using a checklist or guide could help. A good partner will listen to and respect your boundaries, desires, and discomforts every time—and you deserve a good partner.</li>
<li><strong>Find a great therapist.</strong><br />
Trauma is complex, highly individual, and it can take a long time and lots of effort to heal. A great therapist who is trained to treat trauma, and especially sexual trauma, will help you process what you’re experiencing and offer vital support as you heal.</p>
<h2>Remember: healing is a process.</h2>
<p>I get it: When you’ve experienced something as difficult as sexual violence, it may feel impossible to imagine a future when you feel better. And it’s true that for many of us, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/never-late-share-story-sexual-assault/" target="_blank">healing from sexual violence</a> is a lifelong process.</p>
<p>It’s not easy and it’s not fair, but it is possible. And as you heal, you’ll discover the possibility for new and different kinds of intimacy, honesty, and pleasure. At the end of the day, your body is yours, it is amazing, and you deserve to feel comfort, power, and pleasure in every inch of it. We’re rooting for you.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may see your friend crying, hear your friend’s partner make demeaning comments towards them, or notice they seem anxious around or afraid of their partner. Or your friend may open up to you on their own.</p>
<p>Knowing or suspecting that someone you care about is in an abusive relationship can be a deeply conflicting experience. You know it’s taking a toll on their mental and possibly <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/7-self-care-tips-for-when-stress-affects-your-body/" target="_blank">physical health</a> — and you want to help — but you may not feel equipped. You want to swoop in and “rescue” your friend, and yet you know you have to respect their right to make their own choices.</p>
<p>Despite these difficulties, it is possible to support a friend who is in an abusive situation — and often, a good friend’s support <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/relationship-violence-the-secret-that-kills-4-women-a-day" target="_blank">makes all the difference</a>. Offering real support means putting our friend’s needs before our own desire to play the hero. It also means learning about the complex psychological effects of abuse.</p>
<p>We can understand the complexities of abuse by answering one common question: If this relationship is hurting my friend so much, why don’t they just leave?<span id="more-8560"></span></p>
<h2>So Why Is it So Hard to Leave?</h2>
<p>Don’t forget that even if your friend’s relationship is abusive, it’s still a relationship: It’s complicated, and human. There are <a href="http://www.thehotline.org/is-this-abuse/why-do-people-stay-in-abusive-relationships/" target="_blank">many reasons</a> someone may stay with an abusive partner, and there is a lot you can do as a friend to offer nonjudgemental material and mental health support.</p>
<p>Here are a few commons reasons why victims of abuse stay in the relationship, along with ways you can help:</p>
<h3>1. Material Dependency</h3>
<p>If your friend lives with their partner, has a shared bank account, has children with them, relies on their partner’s income, or relies on their partner’s care (for example, if your friend <a href="http://www.thehotline.org/is-this-abuse/domestic-violence-disabilities/" target="_blank">has a disability</a> and their partner is their primary care person), leaving can be extremely challenging.</p>
<p><strong>How to Help </strong></p>
<p>Ask your friend what they need. A place to stay, a ride to work, a buddy for a visit to the doctor? If they have children, offer to provide free childcare while they make plans for their health and safety. If they struggle to pay for groceries without their partner, offer to cook them a couple meals. Help connect your friend to free or low-cost brick-and-mortar or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/" target="_blank">online therapy options</a> like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talkspace" target="_blank">Talkspace</a>, if they’re open to seeking <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a>, and gently encourage them to go.</p>
<h3>2. Shame or Embarrassment</h3>
<p>It’s likely hard for your friend to confront the reality that someone they love has hurt them so badly, and your friend may feel that experiencing abuse means they are weak. But abuse has nothing to do with personal strength or weakness, it’s about the choice of the abuser to cause harm. And asking for help is brave, not shameful.</p>
<p><strong>How to Help</strong></p>
<p>Let your friend know that you are there to support them — without judgement, without conditions, and without shame. Use supporting, rather than blaming language. Not, “How is a smart girl like you with such a jerk?” but “I see that this relationship is causing you a lot of pain, and I’m here to support you.”</p>
<h3>3. Fear of Outing</h3>
<p>If your friend is queer or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/transgender-mental-health-issues-the-challenges-of-a-binary-world/" target="_blank">trans</a>, undocumented, or the relationship is illicit in some way, your friend may fear that asking for help means their gender, sexuality, immigration status or relationship choices will be “outed.” Abusive partners can use “outing” as a threat to make a victim stay.</p>
<p><strong>How to Help </strong></p>
<p>Educate yourself about the <a href="http://tnlr.org/en/" target="_blank">struggles</a> faced by queer, trans, or <a href="http://www.thehotline.org/is-this-abuse/abuse-and-immigrants/" target="_blank">immigrant survivors</a> of violence, and don’t make assumptions about your friend’s relationship or shame them for their choice of partner. Reassure your friend that no matter who they choose as a partner, they deserve to be safe and happy, and that you will not out them to family or friends without their consent.</p>
<h3>4. Social Isolation</h3>
<p>Abusive partners will often isolate their victims from their friends, family, and community. This results in the victim being even more dependent on the abusive partner.</p>
<p><strong>How to Help</strong></p>
<p>You can help your friend rebuild relationships and community support networks they may have lost during the relationship. Invite them out for lunch with old friends, to a party, a spa day, or to play a favorite game. Is there anything your friend loved to do before their relationship that they’ve stopped doing now (playing the trombone, Scrabble)? Invite them to do it together.</p>
<h3>5. Hope That the Abusive Partner Will Change</h3>
<p>Abuse often occurs in a cycle: after an incident of violence, the abuser may apologize profusely and become sweet and loving. It’s normal for a victim to have hope for the future and to believe that the abuser can change. However, the reality is that if abuse happens it’s likely to continue and intensify without a serious intervention, like sustained therapy for the abuser.</p>
<p><strong>How to Help</strong></p>
<p>Ask your friend if they want help making a <a href="http://www.loveisrespect.org/for-yourself/safety-planning/" target="_blank">safety plan</a>. Pass along the National Domestic Violence Hotline number, and let them know they can always call you if they need help or support.</p>
<h3>6. Love</h3>
<p>It’s difficult to talk about, but abusive relationships are still relationships: they may have moments of intimacy, passion, and love. While you can see how harmful the relationship is for your friend, your friend may feel <a href="https://everydayfeminism.com/2016/03/still-love-abusive-partner/" target="_blank">genuine love</a> for their partner. That doesn’t mean what is happening is right; it does mean that what is happening is human.</p>
<p><strong>How to Help</strong></p>
<p>It may not make sense to you, but don’t denigrate your friend’s feelings. We don’t always choose who we fall in love with, but we can choose who we stay with. You can help your friend feel empowered to make that choice by reminding them that they deserve to be treated with respect all the time. And whenever your friend does leave, be there for them — on top of the abuse, your friend is also going through a breakup, and they’ll likely be feeling a lot of difficult emotions.</p>
<h3>7. Feeling Like They Deserve the Abuse</h3>
<p>When people have low self-esteem, sometimes they feel like they deserve to be a victim of abuse. They may even rely on the mistreatment to maintain a negative self-image. People who struggle with mental illness are especially likely to engage in this type of thinking.</p>
<p><strong>How to Help</strong></p>
<p>Try to convince your friend they have the right to be in a happy, healthy relationship. If their self-esteem flourishes, they might no longer feel like they deserve to be hurt and put down. A <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a> can also help them reevaluate self-worth.</p>
<h3>8. Fear of Change</h3>
<p>Sometimes people are terrified of change to the point where they will remain in a painful situation rather than bravely seeking something new. There is a significant amount of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/neurosagacity/201701/the-brain-can-work-against-abuse-victims" target="_blank">psychological research</a> that illustrates this cognitive pattern and shows how it applies to abusive relationships.</p>
<p><strong>How to Help</strong></p>
<p>Again, helping your friend connect with a mental health professional can be invaluable. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/08/the-different-types-of-therapists-and-counselors-the-complete-guide/" target="_blank">Therapists</a> are trained to assist people in changing irrationally negative beliefs that are holding them back.</p>
<p>It will take <a href="http://www.thehotline.org/2017/02/16/supporting-someone-returning-to-abusive-relationship/" target="_blank">time and patience</a>, but your friend can leave.</p>
<p>Leaving an abusive relationship is a process, not necessarily a single, dramatic decision. A victim may try to leave on average <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/09/relationship-violence_n_859309.html" target="_blank">seven or eight</a> times before it finally sticks.</p>
<p>Leaving an abusive relationship is like preparing for a smooth landing to a turbulent flight. You can offer to help your friend put tools in place to make their landing safer. You can offer them a parachute, give them a radio to check in with ground control, and scan the ground to suggest a nice, soft landing spot. You can’t land your friend’s plane for them — ultimately, they’re the pilot — but you can help set up the support so that when your friend is ready, they can safely reach solid ground.</p>
<p>*If your friend is in immanent physical danger, call the police. You can find The National Domestic Violence Hotline’s very helpful guide on when to call 911 <a href="http://www.thehotline.org/2015/06/11/someone-i-know-is-being-abused-should-i-call-the-police/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was sitting on my couch, watching him sleep, sleep oh so peacefully, in my bed. <em>It couldn’t have been rape</em>, I thought, <em>no one rapes someone and then sleeps over</em>. I’d been waiting for the sun to come up, my computer on my lap, searching the internet for the closest Planned Parenthood. The air in my studio apartment felt thick and soggy. I don’t remember the weather, the season, only that I felt bone cold and at the same time like my skin was made of fire and would burn anyone who tried to touch it. He hadn’t used a condom, hadn’t listened when I’d said I didn’t want to have sex. I was confused by the slow and metered breaths moving in an out of my mouth; I felt calm, pragmatic even. I needed a morning after pill, I needed to get information about being tested for STDs. <em>If it had been rape, I wouldn’t be making lists, I’d be a wreck</em>, I thought.<span id="more-7335"></span></p>
<p>Planned Parenthood opened at 8 a.m. and I wanted to be there as soon as the doors were unlocked. I woke him up, told him I had a meeting to get to. It was a lie, but I needed him to leave. I needed to get dressed to go out, start crossing things off my list; the curdled feeling in my stomach might go away if only I could cross some things off my list. He said he’d call me later and I knew I’d never pick up. Not that day or ever again. He kissed me on the cheek, I flinched. I wondered if he could feel me flinch. <em>Rapists don’t kiss you goodbye on the cheek. Maybe it was just a bad date? I didn’t scream after all, I said no, I said it repeatedly, but I never screamed. And I never fought, never hit or punched. He had held my arms down, but my legs were free, it couldn’t have been rape if I didn’t try to kick him.</em> He’d said, “It’ll only take a minute, I’ll be done soon.” And it did only take a minute. And then he rolled over and went to sleep. I got up, naked from the waist down, took a shower, scared and shaken, feeling voiceless and insignificant. I put on sweatpants and a sweatshirt and sat on the couch with my two cats curled up beside me, waiting for morning.</p>
<p>In my cab downtown to the clinic, I went over the night again and again in my head. The details moved fast, a zoetrope of the last nine hours. It had been late, 11pm when he’d called to say he was in the neighborhood and could he stop by. I told him to come over. I liked him; he was handsome and tall and funny, maybe a little too buttoned-up for me, maybe a little too blonde, too preppy, but we had friends in common and had been having a nice time together. We were just two dates in, only starting to get to know one another. I was happy to see him when he arrived at my door. We each had one Corona and looked for something to watch on TV. The options were limited—no cable—and we settled on Spy Kids 2. <em>No one gets raped watching Spy Kids 2</em>, I kept thinking, as if that could change what had happened. I couldn’t remember who kissed who first, but it might have been me. I’d wanted to kiss him.</p>
<p>I told the woman at Planned Parenthood the condom had broken; I didn’t want to seem irresponsible and say we hadn’t used one, that he hadn’t used one. She wrote me a prescription for Plan B (you still needed one in those days), told me to make an appointment with my OB-GYN for an STD test, and I left. I almost turned around to go back and tell her what really happened; I suddenly felt like I wanted to tell someone, but I worried I’d sound foolish and so very weak. <em>I hadn’t fought. I hadn’t screamed.</em></p>
<p>For months, I found myself wanting to talk about it, but I was always too embarrassed. What had happened felt like such a violation of my body, but I remained reluctant to call it rape. I thought rape was only something that happened in dark alleys, it was a violent torture, a fight for your life, scream for help, knife to your throat assault. It was a stranger grabbing you.</p>
<p>What had happened to me had been quiet, in my own bed, quick and vulnerable, but not violent. I eventually told an old friend, and I watched as she grew uncomfortable. She said it didn’t sound like rape, we’d probably just had too much to drink. <em>One beer</em>, I wanted to say to her. <em>I’d had one beer</em>, I wanted to shout. She changed the topic as quickly as possible. I felt unheard and furious. I questioned, not for the first time, why my voice was so unimportant. And somewhere deep down, after months of living with this grey trauma, holding it in, heavy and consuming, I knew then what it was. It was rape.</p>
<p>It was almost a year after the incident before I finally told my <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a>. The sense of smallness I lived with had become unbearable and I no longer cared about the feeling of humiliation that threatened me any time I came close to talking about that night. I needed someone to look at me and hear me as I spoke. I needed a witness to my pain, to my experience. I still wondered if I had done something wrong, something to cause my date to behave as he did. I was desperate to hear someone tell me it wasn’t my fault and my therapist did exactly that. In all the years I spent in therapy, it is maybe the only time I remember him telling me precisely what I wanted to hear, and I never needed it more than I did then. He helped me to have the confidence to share my story with other friends, all of whom listened, judgement-free, and many of whom shared their own tales of trauma.</p>
<p>Over the years, the more women I’ve told, the more stories I’ve heard in return. We are all so connected in our experience, in our doubt, our shame, our rage. The times men have taken without asking, touched when we’ve said no, grabbed, kissed, held us down, we carry these moments with us, vowing never to let it happen again. And I’d like to say it didn’t. But that wouldn’t be true. Not three years later, a dear friend decided his desires were more important than mine, my “no” drowned out by his wanting. I knew what to call it this time, and yet I resisted for a while, carrying blame that only belonged to him. <em>We had dated in the past, slept together before, we’d spent holidays together, I didn’t fight for my life, didn’t call the police.</em> Once again, it was the women I met, the people I shared with that helped me take the burden off my shoulders and find strength in the release. I was an imperfect victim, but that didn’t make what happened that night any less real; the details of our relationship didn’t change what he had done to me.</p>
<p>There are many reasons we’re reluctant to come forward, to talk about the things that have happened, the things we wish were different. So often we’re not believed or heard, and sharing with someone who turns a deaf ear can feel like experiencing the assault all over again. Often, we try to protect those who love us by keeping these traumas inside, not wanting their hearts to hurt as much as ours. We protect our attackers. <em>Maybe they didn’t know what they were doing</em>, we think, or maybe it’s just too hard to believe a friend could hurt us so deep. And we worry we might too be culpable, even if only in some small way; we have spent our whole lives hearing that our short skirts, our lipstick, our decision to go out, our walking home alone at night, our inviting a date over at 11pm are the causes of men’s bad behavior. That we, because we smiled, because we said yes to one drink, are the cause.</p>
<p>But we aren’t. And I wasn’t.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since news broke about allegations against media mogul Harvey Weinstein, more than 40 women have come forward to accuse him of sexual assault. Like any time a high-profile sexual violence case comes to light — Bill Cosby, Brock Turner, R. Kelly — the conversation about sexual assault lasts for weeks, many times with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/09/bears-mental-health-burden-discussing-sexual-violence/" target="_blank">survivors bearing the burden of the discussion</a>.</p>
<p>So is the case with the viral <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MeToo&amp;src=tyah&amp;lang=en" target="_blank">#MeToo hashtag</a> — based on a grassroots campaign started by activist <a href="https://twitter.com/taranaburke?lang=en" target="_blank">Tarana Burke</a>. It went viral after actress Alyssa Milano tweeted that people who had been abused or assaulted should post “Me too” in their status. The campaign caught like wildfire, with CNN <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/19/health/me-too-sexual-assault-stories-trigger-trauma/index.html" target="_blank">reporting</a> that Twitter has seen more than 1 million uses of the hashtag and many more on Facebook, creating an outpouring of assault stories for public consumption.<span id="more-6895"></span></p>
<p>For survivors, the #MeToo campaign can be an empowering and validating way to share their story, many for the first time. It’s also overwhelming, especially for sexual assault survivors who deal with mental health symptoms as a result of their trauma. While sharing our stories is crucial, the deluge of reminders of our own sexual assaults can be exhausting and even retraumatizing.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here are seven self-care tips for sexual assault survivors.</p>
<h2>1. Unplug</h2>
<p>When conversations about sexual assault go viral in our hyper-connected world, it often seems like there’s no escape. If you’re not reading the news closely, then your friends are posting on Facebook or we see news snippets during the commercials of our favorite TV shows. It’s everywhere, all the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because #MeToo is so prominent, a lot of my clients feel it&#8217;s inescapable,&#8221; therapist Aida Manduley told CNN. &#8220;I am concerned with the victims of sexual trauma and violence who are saying to me &#8216;I can&#8217;t get away from the trigger, it&#8217;s everywhere.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Though it’s probably near impossible to avoid all the sexual violence news, I find that taking the time to deliberately unplug where I can helps reduce potential triggers. Try reading less of the news, limiting time on social media, and sticking with Netflix or a book to turn down the volume.</p>
<h2>2. Go Back to Basics</h2>
<p>In their tips for self-care, the <a href="https://www.rainn.org/articles/self-care-after-trauma" target="_blank">Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network</a> recommends first taking care of our bodies. Are you eating healthy meals? Are you sleeping? Have you been getting exercise? Meeting these basic physical needs not only has benefits of its own — such as increased endorphins from exercise — but they help our mind function better.</p>
<p>“Our thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and attitudes can positively or negatively affect our biological functioning. In other words, our minds can affect how healthy our bodies are,” <a href="https://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/what-is-the-mind-body-connection" target="_blank">writes</a> Patricia Hart for the University of Minnesota. “On the other hand, what we do with our physical body &#8230; can impact our mental state (again positively or negatively). This results in a complex interrelationship between our minds and bodies.”</p>
<p>In Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, there’s an emotional regulation skill called <a href="https://healthypsych.com/dialectical-behavior-therapy-dbt-please-mastery-technique-for-emotion-regulation/" target="_blank">PLEASE</a>, which stands for:</p>
<p><strong>P</strong>hysical Illness<br />
Balance <strong>E</strong>ating<br />
<strong>A</strong>void Mood Altering Drugs<br />
Balance <strong>S</strong>leep <strong>E</strong>xercise</p>
<p>Give the PLEASE skills a try because doing all these things — meeting our basic physical needs — actually reduces emotional vulnerabilities. It’s a great way to keep yourself on track physically and emotionally.</p>
<h2>3. Get Distracted</h2>
<p>While it might fly against the conventional wisdom that we should face down our problems, for trauma survivors, sometimes we need to take a step back and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/new-type-meditation-reduce-anxiety/" target="_blank">distract or self-soothe ourselves</a> until we regain emotional stability. This is where distraction comes in.</p>
<p>“Distraction works because it interrupts your mood and forces you to ‘shift gears,’” <a href="http://www.centersite.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=9762&amp;cn=353" target="_blank">writes</a> Mark Dombeck, Ph.D. “For best results, the thing you engage yourself in as a means of distraction should be both absorbing and interesting to you. Doing this thing should either require your full attention, or be so absorbing of your attention that you will forget yourself.”</p>
<p>This could mean going for a walk or run, journaling or writing poetry, painting or drawing, spending time with a pet, watching TV, or reading a book. Take a warm bath, drink a soothing cup of tea or hot chocolate, meditate, practice deep breathing or relaxation techniques, or any number of other safe activities that are pleasurable and can help you re-ground you in the present moment.</p>
<h2>4. Get With Your People</h2>
<p>There’s a reason the Beatles sang, “I get by with a little help from my friends.” For sexual assault survivors, it’s crucial to have a safe support network you can reach out to when the going gets tough. Sometimes this is easier said than done.</p>
<p>“Post-trauma survival instincts may cause you to feel most comfortable trusting only yourself, to isolate from others,” writes Tai Pimputkar. “These behaviors may prevent you from reestablishing connection and trust in the world and yourself — vital for healing from the effects of trauma and living a satisfying life.”</p>
<p>Call a close friend, reach out to family, take comfort in a partner’s arms, or join a support or therapy group. Take the time to regularly engage your support system, whether that’s discussing the impact of the news on our mental health, talking about why we’re struggling, laughing about our favorite TV show, or simply spending time together.</p>
<h2>5. Find Professional Support</h2>
<p>If you’re experiencing disruptive symptoms related to trauma, such as severe anxiety, flashbacks, dissociation, self-injury, thoughts of suicide, or other serious mental health warning signs, consider finding professional support. A mental health professional can not only provide a nonjudgemental space to unpack your experiences, they can also teach you new ways to deal with trauma to recover and live a full life.</p>
<p>When seeking a therapist, RAINN <a href="https://www.rainn.org/articles/how-can-therapy-help" target="_blank">recommends</a> looking for a trauma-informed therapist who has experience working with other survivors of sexual assault and who specializes in modalities shown to support survivors, such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy or somatic therapies, among others. You don’t have to go through this alone.</p>
<h2>6. Have a Plan</h2>
<p>With so many potential triggers, it’s crucial to have a crisis safety plan in place that includes everything from your distraction skills to support-people’s phone numbers, and emergency resources, such as the <a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/" target="_blank">National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a> or the address for the nearest hospital.</p>
<p>“I feel very strongly that anyone who has ever had mental health difficulties needs to develop for themselves, while they are well, a crisis plan,” <a href="http://mentalhealthrecovery.com/info-center/crisis-plan/" target="_blank">writes</a> Mary Ellen Copeland. “This plan allows us to maintain some degree of control over our lives even when it feels like everything is out of control.”</p>
<p>You can find crisis plans to fill out online, or you can work with loved ones and your therapist to create your own. Consider giving a copy of your plan to your counselor and a friend or family member so you have extra support, and make yourself copies for your home, bag, and anywhere else you can grab it in a crisis.</p>
<h2>7. No Pressure</h2>
<p>As survivors, we have every right to decide how and when we participate in the conversation, if at all. Sometimes I feel obligated to contribute to the conversation, to post “Me too” on social media. But survivors don’t owe anyone anything, especially when the cost is our health and well-being.</p>
<p>“If ‘Me too’ makes you feel empowered, by all means, type those words. But it’s also important to recognize the campaign’s limitations,” <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/me-too-lets-men-off-the-hook_us_59e4e3a2e4b04d1d518390d2" target="_blank">writes</a> Angelina Chapin. “No woman should feel pressure to tell painful stories about being violated, but every man should feel a responsibility to stop behavior that leads to sexual harassment and assault.”</p>
<p>Our voices when we engage are powerful and important, but we have the option — and the right — to decide how and when we speak up. There’s no pressure to share your story, especially if it feels threatening in any way. However you decide to participate, or not, is perfectly acceptable. After all, carrying the burden of sexual assault doesn’t belong solely to us.</p>
