				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While abuse is often stereotypically portrayed in only one manner, as physical violence, there are actually several types of domestic violence.</p>
<p>Domestic violence is a problem that affects millions of people in all types of relationships — traditional marriages, same-sex partnerships, and relationships where there is no sexual intimacy involved. The United States Department of Justice defines domestic violence as “a pattern of abusive behavior in any relationship that is used by one partner to gain or maintain power and control over another intimate partner.”</p>
<p><span id="more-11197"></span></p>
<h2>The Types of Domestic Violence</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ovw/domestic-violence" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">U.S. DOJ</a>, five types of domestic violence exist, and each has a devastating effect on those involved — including witnesses of the abuse. These include:</p>
<h3>Physical violence</h3>
<p>The use of physical force against another. Examples include hitting, shoving, grabbing, biting, restraining, shaking, choking, burning, forcing the use of drug/alcohol, and assault with a weapon. Physical violence may or may not result in an injury that requires medical attention.</p>
<h3>Sexual violence</h3>
<p>The violation of an individual’s bodily integrity (<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/04/coping-with-sexual-assault-or-picking-up-the-pieces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexual assault</a>), including coercing sexual contact, rape and prostitution, as well as any unwelcome sexual behavior (sexual harassment), including treating someone in a sexually demeaning manner or any other conduct of a sexual nature, whether physical, verbal or non-verbal. Sexual abuse also includes behavior, which limits reproductive rights, such as preventing use of contractive methods and forcing abortion.</p>
<h3>Economic abuse</h3>
<p>Making or attempting to make the victim financially dependent on the abuser. Examples of this include preventing or forbidding an intimate partner from working or gaining an education, controlling the financial resources and withholding access to economic resources.</p>
<h3>Psychological abuse</h3>
<p>Intimidation, threats of harm and isolation. Examples include instilling fear in an intimate partner through threatening behavior, such as damaging property or abusing pets, constant supervision or controlling what the victim does and who they talk to.</p>
<p>Further, spiritual abuse may be included as a type of psychological abuse. It involves the misuse of spiritual or religious beliefs to manipulate or exert power and control over an intimate partner. For example, using scripture to justify abuse or rearing the children in a faith or religious practice the partner has not agreed to.</p>
<h3>Emotional abuse</h3>
<p>Undermining an individual’s sense of self-worth. Examples of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/how-to-recognize-emotional-abuse-in-intimate-relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emotional abuse</a> include constant criticism, name-calling, embarrassing, mocking and humiliating.</p>
<h2>How to Recognize Domestic Abuse</h2>
<p>These types of domestic abuse have many shades and variations, carefully customized by the abuser to use in his or her quest for power and control. Warning signs that a relationship may be abusive include a partner who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Makes you feel like you’re never right</li>
<li>Is unreasonably jealous of other relationships</li>
<li>Questions time you spend away from them</li>
<li>Discourages other relationships, including with family</li>
<li>Shames you</li>
<li>Frightens you</li>
<li>Makes you feel like you can’t make decisions</li>
<li>Controls your actions and/or finances</li>
<li>Threatens your children or pets, or hurts them</li>
<li>Sexually mistreats you, or pushes you into sexual acts you’re not comfortable with</li>
<li>Physically threatens you, or hurts you</li>
</ul>
<p>Family and friends can also help identify abuse by addressing changes in a loved one’s behavior, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Inconsistent explanations:</b> Victims may provide different excuses for the causes of their injuries due to fear of alerting others to the severity of their situation.</li>
<li><b>Alcohol abuse:</b> Victims may use alcohol or other substances as a means to escape from their everyday reality of abuse.</li>
<li><b>Visible injuries:</b> Bruises are the most common form of injury and turn purple to green to yellow as they heal.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Get Help</h2>
<p>A common misconception surrounding these types of domestic violence is that the victim is not strong enough to leave, but it’s far more complex than that. Walking away from an abusive relationship is a process more than a single action. Victims usually make several attempts before they leave the abuser for good. That’s why community support is so important.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know has experienced domestic violence, you are not alone. These three resources are just some of many that can help victims and survivors of domestic violence find support and assistance in their communities.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thehotline.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">National Domestic Violence Hotline</a> (800-799-7233): Open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, this line is a resource for safety information and can connect any caller with shelters and protection advocates in her area.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://vinelink.com/#/home" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">VINE:</a> Active in 47 states, VINE allows victims to search for an offender in custody by name or identification number, then register to be alerted if the offender has been released or transferred, or has escaped.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.womenslaw.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Women’s Law</a>: This site has state-by-state legal information and resources for victims, as well as advice on how to leave an abusive situation, gather evidence of abuse, and prepare for court.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Remember, You Come First</h2>
<p>If you’re trying to decide whether to stay or leave, you may be feeling confused, uncertain, frightened, and torn. One moment, you may desperately want to get away, and the next, you may want to hang on to the relationship. Maybe you even blame yourself for the abuse or feel weak and embarrassed because you’ve stuck around in spite of it.</p>
<p>Don’t be trapped by confusion, guilt, or self-blame. The only thing that matters is your safety or the safety of the victim you are concerned about. Focus on getting help and protecting yourself and those around you who are being impacted by these types of domestic violence.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, a man I know was outed as a serial sexual harasser. I say “know” in a rather unfortunate sense: I’d been approached online by, went on a date with, and even kissed the guy a couple years ago. His too-forward sexual advances had always left a bad taste in my mouth.</p>
<p>When the revelations went live, with dozens of women telling stories of his disrespectful and aggressive behavior, I felt happy he was exposed, yet ashamed I hadn’t listened to my gut instincts. I blamed myself for overlooking his boorish behavior and letting my hope that he could end up being a decent guy take precedence over the warning bells clanging in my head.</p>
<p>Giving that man the benefit of the doubt was not my fault. And if you’ve stayed with an <a href="https://everydayfeminism.com/2016/03/still-love-abusive-partner/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">abusive partner</a>, or even given a guy a second chance after he harassed you, it’s not your fault, either. The pressure to be kind, generous, and forgiving — especially as women — is drummed into our heads from birth.</p>
<p><span id="more-11193"></span></p>
<p>So often, we are trained to prioritize other people’s feelings over our preferences, comfort, and even safety. When it comes to abusive relationships specifically, so many factors — from financial dependence, to reduced self-confidence, to believing our partners can change — can keep us from leaving.</p>
<p>It’s okay to have complex feelings for someone who has harassed or abused you. However, abuse is never the abused person’s fault. It is always the fault of the abuser, who takes advantage of a victim’s trust to hurt them. Victims can’t change abusers, and it’s not healthy or safe to try.</p>
<p>We <i>can</i>, however, care for ourselves, and decide what we need to be happy, healthy, and to live free of emotional, sexual, and physical violence.</p>
<h2>Why Do Victims Stay in Abusive Relationships?</h2>
<p>If you haven’t been in an abusive relationship, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/12/why-doesnt-my-friend-leave-their-abusive-partner-and-how-can-i-help/">it can be difficult</a> to understand how complex abuse dynamics can be. After all, if someone is being verbally, emotionally, sexually, or physically abused, wouldn’t their first impulse be to get as far away from the abuser as possible?</p>
<p>It’s a little more <a href="https://www.thehotline.org/is-this-abuse/why-do-people-stay-in-abusive-relationships/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">complicated</a> than that. Sometimes, abuse victims really want to leave, but they simply can’t. They may be financially dependent on their abusive partners, or may fear that they’ll lose custody of their children. They may also be genuinely afraid for their safety, and even their lives. Research shows that victims are at the highest risk of intimate partner homicide when they try to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/oct/20/domestic-private-violence-women-men-abuse-hbo-ray-rice" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">leave</a>.</p>
<p>While people who have never been in such situations may insensitively say that staying is irrational, these are in reality all rational, understandable reactions to a dangerous and devastating situation. All survivors, <a href="https://www.thehotline.org/2017/02/16/supporting-someone-returning-to-abusive-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">whether they leave or not</a>, and however they feel about their abusers, deserve support and respect.</p>
<h2>Emotional Abuse Can Make it Difficult to Move On</h2>
<p>Abusive relationships are about control, and that includes control of victims’ emotions through <a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/relationships-and-safety/other-types/emotional-and-verbal-abuse" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">psychological abuse</a> and gaslighting. Abusive partners may manipulate victims through threats, coercion, or sweet talk.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.domesticviolenceroundtable.org/domestic-violence-cycle.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Abusive cycles</a> can include a “honeymoon phase,” when the abusive partner apologizes for past violence, promises they won’t repeat their behavior, and treats their partner kindly. The abusive partner may genuinely feel remorse for their actions and intend to keep these promises. But without a sustained commitment to change, hard work, and psychological support, they often <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/abusive-partner-promises-change/">fall back into old patterns</a>, making it unsafe for the victim to stay with them and making these promises another form of control.</p>
<p>This cycle often works through the physiological and psychological experience of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trauma-bonding-explains-why-people-often-stay-in-abusive-relationships-2017-8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">trauma bonding</a>. Abusive relationships can be incredibly intense, with the abused person cycling between searing pain when the abuser hurts or degrades them, and deep joy when the abuser chooses to be kind. This cycle of reward and punishment can lead victims to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/neurosagacity/201701/the-brain-can-work-against-abuse-victims" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">rationalize abuse</a> and try hard to please the abusive partner — even as the abusive partner continues to hurt them.</p>
<p>Finally, as difficult as it may be for people who haven’t experienced abuse to understand, abusive relationships are <a href="https://www.thehotline.org/2016/09/21/why-do-i-love-my-abuser/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">still relationships</a>. Like any other relationship, they can contain moments of intimacy, sweetness, and support.</p>
<p>Unlike a healthy relationship, however, in an abusive relationship, these moments of intimacy are part of a broader cycle of control. They often give the victim false hope that things will get better in the future. While this hope is sadly often misguided, it’s also a real feeling, and abuse victims deserve the space and time to mourn what their relationships meant to them, just like anyone else.</p>
<h2>No Matter How You Feel About Your Abuser, You Deserve Support</h2>
<p>Complex feelings are normal and human, and having complex feelings toward abusive partners isn’t wrong or bad. The truth is, you deserve support and care no matter how you feel about your abuser. And while we can’t change our abusers, and for our own safety shouldn’t try, we can advocate for ourselves and seek the care we need to be healthy and safe.</p>
<p>If you’re currently in an abusive relationship, you can seek support from loved ones, mental health professionals, and domestic violence resource centers like the <a href="https://www.thehotline.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">National Domestic Violence Hotline</a>. You can also find resources on <a href="https://www.thehotline.org/help/path-to-safety/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">making a plan</a> to keep yourself safe.</p>
<p>If you’ve left an abusive relationship and are struggling with past trauma or complex feelings about the abuse (including still having feelings for the person who abused you), it’s a good idea to seek out therapy and support from sympathetic loved ones, survivors’ groups, and victim hotlines.</p>
<p>From online harassers demanding dates to an abusive spouse promising yet again that they’ll change, it’s normal to want to think the best of other people. These feelings don’t make us wrong or bad, they make us human. Rather than judging survivors for having complex feelings toward abusers, we can offer survivors — including ourselves — the compassionate support that truly empowers us to have healthier futures.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The day after Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testified before congress about her experience of sexual violence in relation to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN) received the <a href="https://www.rainn.org/news/rainn-hotline-helps-record-number-survivors" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">highest number of calls</a> in its 24-year history. More than 3,000 people connected with the network on September 28, part of a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-harassment-helplines/metoo-effect-calls-flood-u-s-sexual-assault-hotlines-idUSKBN1F6194" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">record-breaking increase</a> in the number of survivors of sexual violence requesting services since the #MeToo movement began last year.</p>
<p>The outpouring of truth and support has been unprecedented. As countless survivors finally see their experiences reflected in the national conversation, we feel a moment of hope for renewed connection and healing. But this hope is accompanied by pain, as many survivors who do come forward experience backlash. Additionally, survivors have been increasingly exposed to potentially triggering, and seemingly inescapable news around recent, high-profile incidents sexual violence.</p>
<p><span id="more-11179"></span></p>
<h2>Sexual Violence Affects Every Aspect of Survivors’ Lives</h2>
<p>From street harassment to sexual abuse, all forms of nonconsensual sexual attention can have a negative effect on our mental health. Sexual objectification, or any act that dehumanizes us through our sexualities, can <a href="https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/appsych/opus/issues/2016/spring/rooney" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">make us anxious</a>, increase our risk of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depression</a>, and decrease our comfort in our bodies, leading to increased risk of eating disorders. Survivors of sexual violence face substantial mental health barriers, with <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-associated-with-sexual-assault-among-women-in-the-who-world-mental-health-surveys/24319B83A9DF92E8D7E3512041B2B059" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">20% of rape survivors</a> developing PTSD.</p>
<p>These negative mental health effects impact all aspects of survivors’ lives. Street harassment, for example, makes us <a href="http://genprogress.org/voices/2015/11/25/41304/millennials-face-long-term-effects-from-street-harassment/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">alter our paths</a> through the world, limiting where we feel safe. Sexual violence, meanwhile, costs us more than just our wellbeing: between health bills and lost time at work, survivors of sexual violence suffer an average <a href="http://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/nsvrc_talking-points_lifetime-economic-burden_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lifetime financial burden</a> of $122,461. Meanwhile, people who experience intimate partner violence (IPV) in their adolescence obtain <a href="https://iwpr.org/publications/economic-cost-intimate-partner-violence-sexual-assault-stalking/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">0.5 years less education</a> than people who have never experienced IPV.</p>
<p>In the face of this very concrete harm to survivors’ wellbeing, caring for our mental health through social support, wellness, and therapy is vital. Psychological research shows that positive and affirming <a href="https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1114&amp;context=crvaw_facpub" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">social support</a> is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2323517/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">crucial</a> in helping survivors of sexual assault and intimate partner violence heal. Meanwhile, survivors with an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3305196/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">increased sense of empowerment</a> have a reduced risk of being victimized in the future.</p>
<p>Despite its more recent appropriation as a form of pampering, the concept of “<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/when-self-care-becomes-problematic/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">self-care</a>” actually <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2017/04/the_history_of_self_care.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">originated</a> among feminists, rights activists, health workers, and other people who experienced trauma as part of their work, or simply as part of living in an unjust world. Self-care was a way for them to assert their value in a society that devalued them. For survivors of sexual harassment, abuse, and assault — and for all women, who experience sexism in our everyday lives — nurturing our mental health is self-care in this original, revolutionary sense. Caring for our mental health is an act of courage and a commitment to our own thriving. As #MeToo continues, it’s more important than ever.</p>
<h2>We’re in It Together</h2>
<p>It seemed like every time I opened my computer to get started on this article, another #MeToo revelation crossed my social media feed. I’d get another message from a friend struggling with their own memories, or I was hit with another memory of my own. With so many people in our lives sharing pent-up trauma, it can feel like there’s no one to turn to for <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/07/how-to-best-support-a-survivor-of-sexual-assault/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support</a>. Yet in reality, the pervasiveness of #MeToo is precisely its strength: we are in this together.</p>
<p>If the news has you feeling overwhelmed, you are not alone. There is no “right way” to be a survivor or to deal with whatever you’re feeling right now. Instead, it’s important to care for yourself, exactly the way you need to. If that means turning off the news entirely, that’s perfect. If that means sharing your experiences publicly, that’s great, too. Caring for yourself is an act of courage — whether you march in the streets, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talk to a therapist</a>, or cuddle up in bed.</p>
<p>And while every survivor is different, the #MeToo moment has shown us one truth that applies to everyone: no matter who you are or what you’ve experienced, you are not alone.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an effort to raise awareness about domestic violence in the U.S. and across the globe, October has been designated Domestic Violence Awareness Month. This time of the year is an opportunity to deepen our understanding of these issues, share resources, and most importantly, support survivors. But, while it’s a great time to do so, it isn’t the only time.</p>
<p><span id="more-11173"></span></p>
<h2>Domestic Violence Awareness Month — How Far We’ve Come</h2>
<p>Since the <a href="https://www.legalmomentum.org/history-vawa" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Violence Against Women Act</a> passed in 1994, justice for women in abusive situations has strengthened. This landmark legislation, led by then-Senator Joe Biden, combined new provisions that hold offenders accountable and provide programs and services for victims.</p>
<p>For example, the act led to the creation of the Office on Violence Against Women, whose 25 grant programs support domestic violence shelters, sexual assault crisis centers and hotlines, and legal support for victims, among many other programs. As a result, between 1994 and 2010, the overall rate of domestic violence <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=4536" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">dropped nearly two-thirds</a>, and state laws have reformed to address issues such as dating abuse in the workplace, stalking, employment discrimination and more.</p>
<p>While we’ve made strides, there’s still much to be done, and Domestic Violence Awareness Month is a great time to realign and focus on these issues. We continue to be flooded with news stories about domestic violence, from <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-rate-of-domestic-violence-arrests-among-nfl-players/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">athletes beating their significant others</a> in <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/08/ray-rice-punch-video_n_5783380.html?utm_hp_ref=sports" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">public elevators</a> to <a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/celebrities-charged-with-domestic-abuse/celebrity-lists" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">celebrities publicly abusing their girlfriends</a>.</p>
<p>This problem is not one that will go away quickly or quietly. Domestic violence continues to <a href="https://ncadv.org/statistics" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">affect millions</a>, both women and men, of every race, religion, culture and status. Thirty-five percent of women worldwide have experienced either physical or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence (or a combination), according to the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/chapter6/chapter6.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">United Nations</a>.</p>
<h2>How You Can Make a Difference Before, During, and After Domestic Violence Awareness Month</h2>
<p>If you know or suspect that someone is a victim of domestic violence, you might feel clueless about the best way to help. But don’t let fear of saying the wrong thing prevent you from reaching out. And, if you don’t have any personal reasons to help, don’t think you have to sit on the sideline.</p>
<p>The world for many <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/5-celebrity-women-spoke-domestic-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">domestic abuse victims</a> can be lonely, isolated, and filled with fear. Knowing there are people out there willing to help them can provide tremendous relief. Here are a few ways to get involved:</p>
<h3>March to heighten awareness about domestic violence</h3>
<p>Hundreds of the cities have marches or rallies for the cause in the month of October. Many include a drumming circle and candlelight vigils honoring victims and survivors of domestic violence. Check out local events near you and plan to get involved.</p>
<h3>Educate yourself on the signs of abuse</h3>
<p>Rarely, if ever, do we hear about domestic abuse from our friends — even though statistically we may know plenty of people who have suffered domestic abuse. Educating yourself on the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/is-it-a-normal-fight-or-verbal-abuse-heres-how-to-tell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signs of abuse</a> might save a friend or family member’s life. Here are a few of the signs that medical professionals say to <a href="http://www.newhopeforwomen.org/abuser-tricks" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">watch out for</a>.</p>
<h3>Be a source of comfort</h3>
<p>You don’t have to be an expert to make a difference — you just have to be yourself. If someone shares their experience with you, it’s because you are a person they look to for support, compassion, and guidance. Although you can’t take away what happened to someone, you can be a source of comfort.</p>
<h3>Donate whatever goods you can</h3>
<p>Domestic violence survivors who leave an abuser often have little more than the clothes on their backs. In fact, domestic violence is one of the leading causes of homelessness for families across the nation. Donations of cash or household goods, uniforms, toys and small appliances can make a big difference.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="http://www.thehotline.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">National Domestic Hotline</a> is looking for donations of financial contributions and old cell phones. If you shop online, you can also click a button that will automatically donate a small portion of your purchase to the cause through Amazon Smile and Ebay Giving Works Program. Similarly, the <a href="http://www.ncadv.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">National Coalition Against Domestic Violence</a> is looking for financial contributions and old cell phones, and offers a shop with items displaying their logo to raise awareness. Also, check with your local shelter to see how you can help.</p>
<h2>Remember, You Don’t Have to Suffer Alone</h2>
<p>If you are a victim of abuse or violence at the hands of someone you know or love, or you are recovering from an assault by a stranger, you are not alone. Get immediate help and support.</p>
<p>The National Domestic Violence Hotline can be reached 24 hours a day, seven days a week at (800) 799-SAFE (7233).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting out of an abusive relationship is one of the most difficult obstacles single moms can face. Summoning the courage and tenacity to walk away when they have no clue what the future will hold takes gall and serious faith.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is hope on the other side. Leaving an abusive relationship is only the beginning. Here are five ways to begin the journey of healing to help you not only survive, but thrive.</p>
<h2>1.Talk to Someone</h2>
<p><a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_BOTTOM&amp;utr_adgroup=bottom-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=6721" target="_blank">Get professional help</a>. Sharing your story is one of the most crucial ways to heal productively after surviving relationship violence. Although the hurt and shame of it may continue to feel like a dark cloud over your head, one way to lessen the pain is to regain control and own your own story.</p>
<p>Sharing with close friends and family members is a start, but going to a licensed professional is much better. A <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">psychotherapist</a> trained in relationship trauma is prepared to offer a safe space as well as an objective disposition. His or her job is to guide people through pain while they are on the road to becoming their whole, healed selves. It is powerful to work with someone whose primary duty is to listen and help dissect the truth. Communicating with a person capable of supporting you in the <a href="https://esme.com/resources/content/domestic-violence/overcoming-self-doubt-after-abuse" target="_blank">journey of healing</a> while sharing tools of empowerment can make a world of difference.<span id="more-6721"></span></p>
<h2>2. Invest In Yourself</h2>
<p>Choose a creative hobby or learn something new. Chances are that in the midst of a toxic relationship <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jenni-bevill/five-signs-that-youve-los_b_8271000.html" target="_blank">you lost touch with yourself</a>. Who were you before this relationship took you out of your element? What did you do for fun? What were you passionate about? It’s possible you may not remember. If that’s the case, this is a great time to get to know yourself.</p>
<p>To fully know your worth, try spending some time figuring out who you are and why you’re here. Coming into a strong sense of purpose and self-worth creates a standard that makes it nearly impossible for anyone to treat you poorly or without respect.</p>
<p>How do you get in touch with yourself? A great way to start is by journaling. See what words and feelings come to mind when nobody’s around. What do you care about? What makes you happy/sad/angry? What kind of life do you envision for yourself and your children?</p>
<p>Next, maybe create a vision board. Choose images that resonate with you. It doesn’t matter what they are, as long as they speak to you. Add some affirmations: “I am enough.” “I deserve happiness.” “I will create a life I love.” Read some personal-development and self-help books to spark inspiration or motivation. Develop a personal library to return to time and again when you need a little pick-me-up.</p>
<h2>3. Create Distance from the Abuse by Changing Your Environment</h2>
<p>A change of scenery invites a breath of fresh air, psychologically speaking. It’s possible that flashbacks of horrific incidents show up at the most inconvenient times.</p>
<p>If moving is not an option for you, try making some small changes in the form of DIY projects. Maybe paint the walls a color you love. Perhaps a slipcover for your sofa, fresh linens, or maybe even a few potted plants would do wonders to lift your spirits. Grab a bundle of sage to burn and clear out negative energy, if you’re into that sort of thing. If moving is an option, it’s a great chance to create a loving and welcoming space for you and your children to dwell in.</p>
<h2>4. Join a Community of Survivors</h2>
<p>If there is ever a time to connect with other women, it’s now. Sometimes those we love and feel closest to aren’t able to relate to our situation.</p>
<p>Family and friends who know you can sometimes be a hindrance to your healing. They usually mean well, but they have a history with you. It can be second nature for them to offer unwelcome advice. Because they likely know and have spent time with the partner who abused you, their feedback might include the all-too-familiar, “I told you so.”</p>
<p>Someone who has walked in your shoes can most likely offer a safe, judgment-free space, and a fresh perspective. Recovering emotionally from trauma can create feelings of intense shame and isolation, and combating those feelings alone could prove extremely difficult. Meeting new people who might be empathetic could do wonders for your heart. This gives you a chance to make new friends without having to explain everything you’ve gone through.</p>
<p>Even if making new friends isn’t on your agenda, consider meeting regularly with a support group. Listening to other people’s stories can provide clarity and validation for what can be a very muddled haze of feelings about your past. The act of gathering gives you a reason to get out of the house regularly and can be empowering.</p>
<h2>5. When You’re Ready, Give Back</h2>
<p>Giving back can take many forms. Providing hospitality to someone else in need could be a wonderful experience if you’re up for it. Be mindful of your own needs first, though. Create healthy boundaries, and know that doing something like this is always optional.</p>
<p>Sharing your story is another way to give back. If you want to help another woman overcome similar obstacles, opening up about your struggles could be a wonderful way to do it.</p>
<p>By the time you feel ready to step up to the challenge of supporting others, you will have learned how resilient you are and how much you have to offer the world. Your voice will start to emerge. By empowering others, you will feel empowered. Keep in mind that you must first be healed enough to share the story and insight without feeling triggered.</p>
<p>Nothing about the journey of recovering from abuse is easy, and it won’t happen overnight. Allow time to heal. Be willing to do the emotional work of uncovering the pain that’s been buried deep.</p>
<p>You deserve the chance to heal and know what it’s like to be fully free. Moving past old habits to learn new ones is highly important.</p>
<p>Above all, be kind to yourself. Being a victim of abuse does not define you. That part of your past is only a small chapter in the big book that is your life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About <a href="http://ncadv.org/learn-more/statistics" target="_blank">20 people</a> are victims of domestic violence every minute in the United States. Domestic violence is an enormous issue, and we need powerful voices to address it.</p>
<p>We wanted to salute those in the spotlight who have spoken about their personal experiences with domestic and intimate partner violence. Because survivors often suffer in silence, we hope these public voices offer inspiration and courage to those who might need support.</p>
<h2>Tamron Hall</h2>
<p>Tamron Hall, a host for NBC’s “Today” show, has been an advocate for survivors of domestic abuse for many years. Hall&#8217;s sister died as a result of her abusive relationship. This was the catalyst for Hall&#8217;s advocacy. Her sister’s death is still unsolved.</p>
<p>Hall has been open about her struggles with guilt about her sister Renate’s death. Her feelings echo those of family members across the world who have struggled with having a loved one in an abusive relationship. She started the <a href="https://www.safehorizon.org/safe-horizon-in-the-news/tamron-hall/" target="_blank">Tamron Renate Hall Fund</a> with her sons to help survivors of domestic abuse.<span id="more-5540"></span></p>
<h2>Amber Tamblyn</h2>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-5543 aligncenter" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/amber-tamblyn-dv-secondary_1320W_JR-1024x683.jpg" alt="amber tamblyn stronger together podium" width="660" height="440" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/amber-tamblyn-dv-secondary_1320W_JR-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/amber-tamblyn-dv-secondary_1320W_JR-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/amber-tamblyn-dv-secondary_1320W_JR-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/amber-tamblyn-dv-secondary_1320W_JR.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>Actress Amber Tamblyn <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BLWMkrSDopR/" target="_blank">opened about up her history of living through an abusive relationship</a> after violent rhetoric became a part of the 2016 presidential campaign. As she posted her story on Instagram, Tamblyn discussed the shame and embarrassment she felt about the relationship and how she fears her parents and family will react to the news. Her story is a courageous example of how using one’s voice can help more survivors speak up and get the support they need.</p>
<h2>Charlize Theron</h2>
<p>An ambassador for women and girls worldwide, actress Charlize Theron grew up in an emotionally and physically abusive household. At the age of 15 Theron witnessed her mother shoot and kill her father in self-defense. She has been open about living through the abuse at the hands of her father as well.</p>
<h2>Robin Givens</h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5547 aligncenter" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/robin-givens-dv-secondary_600W_JR2.jpg" alt="robin givens red carpet" width="660" height="521" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/robin-givens-dv-secondary_600W_JR2.jpg 660w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/robin-givens-dv-secondary_600W_JR2-300x237.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>Actress Robin Givens is a survivor of domestic violence and has been vocal about her experiences with then-husband, boxer Mike Tyson. Givens has been open about the physical abuse she experienced during their marriage in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>Tyson then minimized the abuse in later interviews by saying, “I grabbed my wife and hold my wife, you know what I mean? I shake my wife up. I never totally struck my wife.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Kerry Washington</h2>
<p>Many do not think of financial abuse when discussing the topic of domestic violence. Actress and advocate Kerry Washington works with the <a href="http://purplepurse.com/" target="_blank">Purple Purse Campaign</a>, which helps women in domestic violence relationships with the financial support they need to move toward independence.</p>
<p>In an <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/14/entertainment/kerry-washington-domestic-violence-purple-purse/" target="_blank">interview with CNN</a>, Washington said, “The most important thing to know is there is a way out. That there is a way to learn how to become financially self-supporting and take care of yourself so that you can make decisions for yourself that are empowering.&#8221;</p>
<p>Take a minute, not just to thank these women for their work, but to explore their campaigns and consider giving. It’s vital that we acknowledge people who bring awareness to domestic violence, which can precipitate a host of mental health challenges!</p>
