				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Almost all of us have times that we have trouble falling asleep, or staying asleep. Others may experience restless, choppy, wakeful sleep cycles. Many of us probably tell ourselves — and others — that we have &#8220;insomnia.&#8221;</p>
<p>But according to clinicians, for insomnia <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2924526/" target="_blank">to be considered a chronic problem</a>, it must significantly impact our lives, and it must be present at least 3 days a week for 3 months. In fact — and unfortunately — many of us actually fit this criteria, with as much as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2924526/" target="_blank">30% of adults experiencing intermittent insomnia</a>, and 10% experiencing it chronically.</p>
<p>Many insomnia sufferers don’t seek treatment, and others find the commonly doled out treatment ideas to be unsuccessful. But sleep-deprivation is something that can impact our lives in significant ways, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/sleep-deprivation-hurts-mental-health/" target="_blank">exacerbating our physical and mental health</a>, as well as our ability to perform basic tasks safely and efficiently.</p>
<p><span id="more-9288"></span></p>
<p>Anyone who has experienced insomnia knows that most “sleep advice” doesn’t really do much good when you are lying in bed desperately tossing and turning. But that may be because the cure to insomnia should involve a more holistic, preventative approach.</p>
<p>It’s not necessarily what tactics you employ in those moments right before sleep. But becoming more proactive about instilling good sleep habits throughout your day — so that your mind and body are prepared for a calm release into sleep at night — might just be the answer.</p>
<p>Here are some methods proven to help you keep stress at bay and reduce the odds of suffering from insomnia — before bedtime even begins.</p>
<h2>1. Write down tomorrow’s to-do list before bed.</h2>
<p>Research from Baylor University, published in the American Psychological Association’s <em><a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-47677-001" target="_blank">Journal of Experimental Psychology</a></em>, showed that the simple act of writing down your to-do list for the upcoming day can do you a world of good when it comes to falling asleep that night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most people just cycle through their to-do lists in their heads, and so we wanted to explore whether the act of writing them down could counteract nighttime difficulties with falling asleep.&#8221; Michael K. Scullin, Ph.D., director of Baylor’s Sleep Neuroscience and Cognition Laboratory, explained.</p>
<p>Just taking five minutes before bed to plan their to-do list for the next day was immensely helpful for the participants in the study. It makes sense if you think about it, since writing is an excellent way to “spill” or “purge” your thoughts, so that you become free of them. As a writer myself, I can attest that writing works to “unstick” distressing thoughts and ideas from the mind.</p>
<h2>2. Meditate during the day and/or right before bed.</h2>
<p>A study published in <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2110998" target="_blank">JAMA Internal Medicine</a> showed that participants who were taught a meditation program for six weeks had greater reductions in their insomnia symptoms than participants who attended a basic sleep education class for the same duration.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/new-type-meditation-reduce-anxiety/" target="_blank">Meditation can be simple</a>, quick, and you don’t need to do it perfectly for it to be effective. Even a few minutes can work wonders, and you can even download an app on your phone to help you try it.</p>
<p>“Concentrate on your breath while lying in bed for an evening mindfulness ritual,” explains Deb Cichon, a Licensed Mental Health Counselor and Talkspace therapist from New York. “It is fine if your mind wanders, but try to keep bringing it back to your breath. Doing this for 10-15 minutes while combined with some relaxing sounds in the background, can assist with falling asleep.”</p>
<p>You might even consider combining this practice with aromatherapy, offers Christine Carre, a Licensed Clinical Social Worker and Talkspace therapist from New York. An aromatherapy diffuser in the room as you fall asleep is great, or try essential oils applied to your spine or bottoms of your feet. Tim Leslie, a Talkspace therapist and Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist from California, recommends lavender, chamomile, bergamont, and jasmine as good nighttime aromatherapy elixirs.</p>
<h2>3. Address &#8220;bigger picture&#8221; concerns with a therapist.</h2>
<p>Sometimes just addressing your anxiety and fears with a therapist in a general sense will help calm your body and mind and aid in falling asleep. But other times, a more pointed approach to insomnia is helpful.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-how-is-it-conducted-online/" target="_blank">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</a> is a modality that has been proven to work in treating insomnia. You would need to find a therapist specifically versed in the practice of CBT for insomnia (referred to as CBT-I) suggests <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2014/02/13/276503025/working-with-a-therapist-can-help-when-sleeping-pills-dont" target="_blank">an NPR article on the subject.</a></p>
<p>The treatment involves keeping a “sleep diary,” discussing your nighttime habits with your therapist, and listening to specific suggestions from your therapist to implement. CBT-I can take time and effort on behalf of the therapist and patient, but the payoff can be great.</p>
<p>In addition to CBT-I, if you know you have PTSD, getting treatment for that has been shown to have a direct and lasting impact on your insomnia. Trauma can directly affect our ability to sleep, and even traumas from long ago can continue to impact how we sleep years later.</p>
<h2>4. Practice good daily “sleep hygiene.”</h2>
<p>If insomnia has become a chronic problem for you, it is helpful to make positive choices throughout your day that will usher in sleep. Experts have begun calling these habits “<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/calm-mind-cant-sleep/" target="_blank">sleep hygiene</a>” because they are something that must consciously practiced, and integrated into your life.</p>
<p>So what would some of these practices be? Kimberly Brown, a Licensed Clinical Social Worker and Talkspace therapist from Alaska, has some answers.</p>
<p>“We talk to our clients often about good practice behaviors such as limiting naps during the day, avoiding screen time of any kind, especially the phone about an hour or so before bed, avoiding drinking any stimulants, a bedtime stretch or exercise that increases the heart rate, and have a calming environment,” Brown suggests.</p>
<p>One small, but important thing you can do is to make sure you put your phone on the “do not disturb” setting before bed, explains Sarah White, Talkspace therapist and Licensed Clinical Mental Health Counselor from Vermont. This way, texts, emails, and social media won’t wake you up during the night.</p>
<p>“Your brain needs to depend on certain quiet hours to sleep regularly, thus avoiding insomnia,” says White.</p>
<p>And as much as many of us seek comfort in our phones if we are up with insomnia, putting your phone “to bed” in another room can be enormously useful as well, since much of what we view and interact with on our phones has the potential to trigger stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>Even if you have been dealing with insomnia for months or years, it is never too late to tackle the issue proactively — and, of course, with as much help and support as you need. We all deserve the benefits of a good night’s sleep, and there are simple and effective ways to make that a reality.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been a light sleeper since birth, but deep into my 20s, I’ve found myself confronting a new problem: nights spent staring at the ceiling waiting desperately for sleep. A series of big life changes — a new marriage, home, job, and puppy — turned my once-calm mind into a spinning series of worries and to-do lists.</p>
<p>In fact, I swore my brain grew wilder and more active after nightfall.</p>
<p>I’m not alone. Restless nights spent struggling to sleep are an age-old problem. The earliest cavemen probably tossed on their rocks, and even the richest among us lay exhausted (yet awake) on their 100% cotton sheets. But when a few nights of restlessness become a never-ending half-slumber, insomnia can wreak havoc on the human body — and the brain.<span id="more-9225"></span></p>
<p>Just because you’re not lying in bed at night staring at the ceiling doesn’t mean you won’t benefit from a medical or psychological consult. <a href="https://sleepfoundation.org/insomnia/content/what-are-different-types-insomnia" target="_blank">Your insomnia might be chronic</a> if you can’t fall or stay asleep more than three times per week for longer than three months, or it may be a temporary affliction, which is often caused by stress. You might find falling asleep impossible, or perhaps your challenge is the staying asleep part.</p>
<p>No matter how your insomnia presents, you’re not alone. Approximately <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1978319/" target="_blank">30 percent of adults</a> grapple with sleep-related issues at any one time, and 10 percent experience daytime impairment or distress.</p>
<p>While your first stop should be at the doctor — a variety of medical conditions can cause insomnia, including asthma, acid reflux, and hyperthyroidism — many times, insomnia is just one of the negative results of our endlessly busy, endlessly stressful modern lives. And <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/sleep-deprivation-hurts-mental-health/" target="_blank">not getting enough sleep can negatively impact both physical and mental health.</a></p>
<p>“No matter where you live or what you do, stress is a part of life,” said Amanda Rausch, a therapist from Seattle, Washington. “Stress activates our basic biological fight or flight instinct, which inhibits sleep.”</p>
<p><em>&#8220;But I’m not stressed!&#8221;</em> you might be thinking. I am perfectly handling a full-time job and a side venture and two children! Assuming you’ve ruled out a medical cause, consider the possibility that you are, in fact, stressed. Possibly very stressed.</p>
<p>“If you are laying in bed and unable to quiet your thoughts, there likely is a root issue of stress,” said Rausch. What thoughts are rushing through your brain? Are you worried about work, or about your children, or about an upcoming life change? <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/sleeping-with-anxiety/" target="_blank">Pinpointing your stressor</a> can provide one avenue to relief.</p>
<p>But perhaps your stressors are more general. If you can’t identify a single topic of worry, you might be dealing with a more serious mental health concern.</p>
<p>“Are you worrying about the future?” asked Rausch. “That could be a symptom of anxiety.” Its opposite — ruminating on the past — might indicate depression.</p>
<p>Visiting a therapist can help you sort out the deeper reasons behind your insomnia and develop a battle plan to address its causes. Rausch recommended looking for a therapist who specializes in cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia, which is “what many call the gold standard of treatment,” she said. “This is a standardized protocol that teaches clients the impact of their thoughts and behaviors on sleep and helps teach proper sleep hygiene.”</p>
<p>Other helpful therapeutic approaches include mindfulness-based stress reduction, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/new-type-meditation-reduce-anxiety/" target="_blank">meditation</a>, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, or biofeedback</p>
<p>But even the best therapy won’t eliminate your insomnia overnight. Here are four tips to help get some shut-eye even when your mind is churning.</p>
<h2>1. Create a sleep hygiene routine.</h2>
<p>Help your body prepare for bedtime by “doing the same things in the same order,” said Rausch.</p>
<p>Brush your teeth, turn off the lights, take a hot shower, meditate for 10 minutes, then sleep — or whatever routine makes you feel satisfied and comfortable. Soon, your body will start moving into sleep mode as soon as you begin your routine.</p>
<p>For Rausch, the effects of her pre-bed regimen wereimmediately apparent: “My pets run downstairs to jump right into bed at the first time of my routine because they know what’s coming up,” she said. “We can train our brain the same way.”</p>
<h2>2. Write down your worries.</h2>
<p>Mind racing with thoughts and concerns? Find a pen and paper, turn on the lights, and take notes.</p>
<p>“Get up for 10 minutes and write down everything on your mind or on your to-do list, then set it aside and return to bed,” said Rausch. When those thoughts pop up again, they’ll be easier to dismiss — tell yourself, “I have already thought about that, have written it down, and will revisit it tomorrow,” she advises.</p>
<h2>3. Focus on your breathing.</h2>
<p>Meditation and mindfulness might seem like scary words if you’re not used to being quiet with your thoughts. But when sleep is elusive, meditation can be the best cure. Start slow: Breathe in for five seconds, hold your breath for three more seconds, then slowly exhale for another five seconds to center yourself. That&#8217;s it!</p>
<p>“Slowing the breath will calm the body and disarm that fight or flight response,” said Rausch. Focus on the rise and fall of your stomach — not your chest — and visualize a beautiful, fenced-in safe space, like a garden or private beach. All of the anxious thoughts stay on the other side of the fence, letting you sleep.</p>
<p>Still struggling to snooze? “Focus on your sense of touch,” Rausch advised. “Touch something soft between your fingers and allow it to feel soft and soothing.”</p>
<h2>4. Fix your sleep environment.</h2>
<p>Even if you’re not struggling with insomnia, creating an ideal sleep environment is key to restful nights. Good sleep relies on four essential elements: light, movement, temperature, and sound. That means blackout curtains, chillier temps, snuggly blankets, quiet (or relaxing noises, like rain, if that’s your jam), and — sorry, Maggie — no rogue animals stealing your sleep.</p>
<p>Once you’ve created an oasis of calm in your bedroom, expect to see your sleep quality skyrocket. But keep in mind that these physical adjustments alone may not be enough to still your mind entirely. Focusing on your mental health and learning to quiet your thoughts with the guidance of a therapist can help turn your nighttime hell into heaven.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sleep research is gradually establishing itself as an important field, and a recent study focusing on the relationship between insomnia and depression may have useful implications for mental health practitioners.</p>
<p>Insomnia is generally regarded as a core symptom of depression, but new research shows that it may actually be a cause of it. <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/press-release/treating-insomnia-may-reduce-mental-health-problems" target="_blank">The study</a>, which was conducted by sleep researchers at the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, found that “sleep disruption is a driving factor in the occurrence of paranoia, hallucinatory experiences, and other mental health problems in young adults with an average age of 25.”</p>
<p><span id="more-8869"></span></p>
<p>Researchers carried out tests on 3,755 students, aiming to improve their sleep in order to find out the effect of quality rest on paranoia, anxiety and depression. One group received <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/control-emotions-cognitive-behavioral-therapy/" target="_blank">cognitive behavioral therapy</a> (CBT) for insomnia, while the other did not. “Individuals who received the CBT sleep treatment showed large reductions in insomnia, as well as small, sustained reductions in paranoia and hallucinatory experiences,” says the university. “The treatment also led to improvements in depression, anxiety, nightmares, psychological well-being, and daytime work and home functioning,”</p>
<p>The study, published in British journal <em>The Lancet</em>, is the first to generate evidence suggesting that insomnia is a cause of, or contributing factor to, psychological problems. “A good night’s sleep really can make a difference to people’s psychological health. Helping people get better sleep could be an important first step in tackling many psychological and emotional problems,” says Professor Daniel Freeman, who led the study.</p>
<p>According to Christopher Barnes, an associate professor at the University of Washington who focuses on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8rpaCSm708" target="_blank">fatigue in organizations</a>, lack of sleep affects the part of the brain that’s used for managing emotions. “There are two regions of the brain which are especially important in emotion regulation – the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/sleep-deprivation-hurts-mental-health/" target="_blank">Sleep deprivation</a> leads to decrements in the pre-frontal cortex, and also negatively influences the manner in which the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala work together,” Barnes says. Due to their fatigue, people struggle to regulate their emotions, and further negative feelings often come up as a result, leading the cycle to continue. “[S]leep deprivation can not only lead to the experience of more negative emotions, but also greater variability in mood, and more emotional reactivity,” Barnes clarifies. That’s why insomnia so often coexists with mood swings, grumpiness and erratic behavior.</p>
<p>In his book <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/21/why-we-sleep-by-matthew-walker-review" target="_blank"><em>Why We Sleep</em></a>, Matthew Walker, professor of neuroscience and neurology at UC Berkeley, explains the relationship between sleep and emotional regulation in even greater detail. According to Walker, tests using MRI brain scans showed that the amygdala was around 60 per cent more reactive in emotional reactivity in test participants who were sleep deprived. “It was as though, without sleep, our brain reverts to a primitive pattern of uncontrolled reactivity. We produce unmetered, inappropriate emotional reactions, and are unable to place events into a broader or considered context,” he writes. Walker says that further MRI scans showed that a full night’s sleep meant that the amygdala was more strictly coupled to the pre-frontal cortex, which acts an emotional brake on the amygdala, our “emotional gas pedal”.</p>
<p>Walker, in <em>Why We Sleep</em>, also writes that the causal relationship between lack of sleep and depression may go both ways. “I firmly believe that sleep loss and mental illness is best described as a two-way street of interaction, with the flow of traffic being stronger in one direction or the other, depending on the disorder. I am not suggesting that all psychiatric conditions are caused by absent sleep. However, I am suggesting that sleep disruption remains a neglected factor contributing to the instigation and/or maintenance of numerous psychiatric illnesses, and has powerful diagnostic and therapeutic potential that we are yet to fully understand,” Walker writes.</p>
<p>Lack of sleep can even lead to a decline in a person’s personal moral system, Barnes says, noting that this research was the building block into his investigation of the connection between lack of sleep and abusive supervision in the workplace. “The prefrontal cortex is heavily involved in self-regulation, especially what we would consider to be the exercise of self-control in a situation of temptation,” he says. “The prefrontal cortex suffers functional decrements when we are sleep deprived. We face many temptations in our daily lives, and are typically able to exert self-control in order to resist those temptations. But when we are sleep deprived, that ability to exert self-control is undermined, and we are more likely to cave to temptations,” Barnes says.</p>
<p>Sleep research could be a boon for mental health practitioners and patients, suggests Russell Foster, head of <a href="https://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/research/sensory-and-circadian-neuroscience" target="_blank">Oxford’s Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute</a>. “Sleep disruption is a very common feature of mental illness, yet despite its prevalence the clinical relevance is often overlooked, and even when recognized, treatment options are limited,” Foster says. “[The Oxford] study is immensely exciting as it not only provides strong evidence for a causal link between psychotic experiences and sleep disruption, but suggests a new therapeutic target for the treatment of psychosis and other mental illnesses,” Foster says.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite advances in neuroscience during the past several decades, sleep continues to remain mostly a mystery. We know we need it as much as water, food and air. We can go weeks without eating food, but what would happen if you went weeks without sleep? Maybe you have. Various degrees of insomnia, and official sleep disorders, are serious conditions. But, what about periodic anxieties that are significant enough to disrupt our sleep. Missing one night of sleep can disrupt our normal biorhythms enough to disrupt the next night&#8217;s, and the next!</p>
<p>Anxiety, for the most part, originates in the mind. The body sensations and feelings we have surrounding anxiety occur because of the psychosomatic nature of our mind-body system. In other words, when we think about situations, even if subconsciously, that appear to be in some way a threat or potential danger, hormones and chemicals are secreted from glands which then give rise to the physiological experiences of tension, tightness, constriction.</p>
<p>These are useful in fight or flight situations, which we believe, at a subconscious level, exist — even if they don’t. The perceived threat or danger is mostly psychological and consists of “what if” statements and pictures in the mind, that are at best unpleasant, and at most, lifestyle threatening. Most all, anxiety is about a future that is, factually, unknown. Anxiety is based on a lot of conjecture.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re too anxious to sleep, there are things you can do to help set up an environment, both internal and external, more conducive to sleep. Consider these tips:<span id="more-6235"></span></p>
<h2>1. Reduce Stimulation</h2>
<p>For how many tens of thousands of years have human beings been without the amount of electrical, auditory, and visual stimulation we take in everyday, and every night? Between television, computers, laptops, tablets and phones, ipods, earbuds and streaming media — which are used extensively every day, and every night — and which have come upon us as a species relatively quickly, our brains are in shock. It’s like having cold water splashed on our face.</p>
<p>We are too often over stimulated. And, that can disrupt our sleep cycle. So, the first tip is to minimize visual and auditory stimulation, at least one hour before bedtime. If you watch television or surf the net in bed before turning out the lights, and have difficulty sleeping, stop. Some people find it helpful to not only minimize visual stimulation, but wear an eye mask to block out any extraneous light. White noise devices can be helpful in drowning out extraneous sounds.</p>
<h2>2. Schedule Sleep</h2>
<p>For many tens of thousands of years, and even much longer than that, human beings have been sleeping, and waking, according to the rhythms of daylight and nighttime. In today&#8217;s world of excessive electrical stimulation, it can be daylight 24/7. We&#8217;ve all pulled all-nighters and know the next day is a bit off kilter, off center, we&#8217;re not quite right, less focused, more scattered, and tired. Our “circadian rhythm” was disrupted. The circadian rhythm is our sleep-wake cycle. We want to take advantage of the long, long history of sleeping patterns for our species.</p>
<p>One of the most basic way is setting a schedule. In prehistory, it wasn&#8217;t much longer after nighttime started that we slept, and, of course, woke up at or prior the break of daylight. Today, with so many options of distraction and diversion, from boredom, from anxiety, we inadvertently work against going to sleep. So, schedule your bedtime, and schedule some activities about an hour prior bedtime, that are conducive to calm and quiet, such as reading, or even just taking time to meditate, reflect upon the day. About an hour before bedtime, dim the lights; if music is on, it should be the kind that is soothing for you. Go to bed well nourished, but having not eaten close to bedtime.</p>
<h2>3. Calm and Quiet</h2>
<p>The suggestions above are more about creating an external environment of calm and quiet before going to bed. We can also create an internal environment of calm and quiet. Self-calming techniques can be very helpful in reducing anxieties of the day. Self calming can include positive affirmations and pleasing visualizations, progressive relaxation, and mindful attention upon our physical existence. Some people find aromatherapy diffusers with specific essential oils very conducive to calm and quiet; some find synthesized music, or “soundscapes” designed to lower brain wave patterns towards those evident in deep sleep very effective in helping when they’re too anxious to sleep.</p>
<p>Even then, the mind may be overactive, amped up, revving, and the best approach towards that situation is laissez faire in which we acknowledge it, and let it be as it is. The body is naturally inclined towards sleep at night. Eight hours of sleep is considered normal, but deviations from that norm are common and not unhealthy. But, if you are having trouble sleeping, at night, when tired, then preparing a calm and quiet inner and outer environment is going to be very helpful to falling asleep.</p>
<h2>4. Let it Be</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re too anxious to sleep, medication is certainly an option to help. But, like surgery, medication ought to be more of a last chance option. It is worth your time and effort to balance your own circadian rhythm naturally, organically, using the tips above. If in bed and too anxious to sleep, you can&#8217;t make it happen. It&#8217;s not a matter of will, or strength, or desire or intention. All you can do is let it be, and adopt a restful, calm, quiet approach of observing, witnessing, being mindful of, the wild wanderings and meanderings of the mind, most of which is memory and conjecture.</p>
<p>In fact, you may not sleep; but, you can rest; you can be comfortable watching the audio-visual motion picture on the screen of your mind. You can visualize, and daydream, as you lay there, in a dark, cool bedroom. You can become attentive to your breathing, your life force, rising, falling, day in, day out, when awake, when asleep.</p>
<h2>5. Live Your Life Well</h2>
<p>Being awake is what we call being alive; of course, we&#8217;re alive when asleep, and when dreaming, but we&#8217;re not conscious of it. If you&#8217;re too anxious to sleep, you may be living your life out of step with your bio-rhythms. In today&#8217;s world of convenience, we miss out on a lot of physical exertion so common to our ancient ancestors, and the brain they had, which we inherited, and which is kind of in shock from rapid overstimulation.</p>
<p>Exercise can be helpful in normalizing our bio-rhythms, and reducing general anxiety; go for walks, or a jog, a swim, a bike ride, go to the gym, or yoga class, or a hike in the woods. At work, set priorities, follow through with tasks, take stretch breaks and do some deep breathing. Be satisfied with what you accomplished this day, and know there is more awaiting tomorrow, and which will be handled well enough, as evidenced by the fact that you&#8217;ve handled many already and are still standing, in large part, because you have slept.</p>
<p>Above all, know that you instinctively know how to sleep. You&#8217;ve been doing it a long time after all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of us wear our lack of sleep as a badge of honor. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in 2013 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/features/dsdrowsydriving/" target="_blank">sleep deprivation</a> was responsible for 72,000 crashes and 800 deaths. The numbers may be slightly underreported; the real number could be closer to <a href="https://www.aaafoundation.org/sites/default/files/AAAFoundation-DrowsyDriving-Nov2014.pdf" target="_blank">6,000</a> fatalities.</p>
<p>Many of us look at sleep as a barrier to success, fun and self-fulfillment, even though sleep deprivation is physiologically and psychologically dangerous. Lack of sleep has been cited as cause in disasters such as the Chernobyl meltdown, the space shuttle Challenger explosion and the Exxon Valdez oil spill. It’s time to face up to the risks associated with our culture of sleep deprivation.<span id="more-5472"></span></p>
<p>Most of us are familiar with the first signs of sleep deprivation, including feeling irritable, having difficulty concentrating and suffering from fatigue. Instead of resting, however, we drink another cup of coffee and power through.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the cumulative impact of sleep deprivation is more dangerous than generally acknowledged. A growing body of <a href="http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/need-sleep/whats-in-it-for-you/mood" target="_blank">sleep research</a> shows that lack of sleep can be responsible for depression, anxiety, stress and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/06/how-to-handle-a-panic-attack-at-work-the-complete-guide/" target="_blank">panic attacks</a>, as well as myriad health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, migraines as well as increased risk for cancer, stroke and dementia.</p>
<p>There’s a reason sleep deprivation is a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/nov/28/un-condemns-sleep-deprivation-among-us-detainees" target="_blank">common method of torture</a>. Detainees who are forced to stay awake experience disorientation, disturbing hallucinations and lethargy. If pushed too far, they suffer physical and mental breakdowns.</p>
<p>The more sleep deprived you are, the more fragile you feel. Small problems can feel insurmountable. This mental state interferes with our interpersonal relationships, including the ability to parent.</p>
<p>Without sleep, the body and brain aren’t given the time they need to heal and recover. “Sleep deprivation is an especially insidious form of torture because it attacks the deep biological functions at the core of a person’s mental and physical health,” explains Sleep and Dream Database Director <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dreaming-in-the-digital-age/201412/why-sleep-deprivation-is-torture" target="_blank">Kelly Bulkeley</a>.</p>
<p>The poet Sylvia Plath wrote in her journal, “I wonder why I don’t go to bed and go to sleep. But then it would be tomorrow, so I decide that no matter how tired, no matter how incoherent I am, I can skip an hour more of sleep and live.” It’s a way to live, but not a way to live well.</p>
<p>For anyone who struggles with mental or medical ailments, lack of sleep is even more dangerous. The body and brain need the regenerative gifts of sleep. Why, then, are so many of us not taking the necessary steps to get a good night’s sleep?</p>
<h2>FOMO [Fear Of Missing Out]</h2>
<p>We’ve all seen exhausted kids throw tantrums when asked to go to bed. Why do they scream “I’m not tired!” when clearly they are? It’s because they feel like they will be missing out if they go to sleep.</p>
<p>Too often adults replay this scenario, even if (mostly) without the hysterics. I’m sure we can all relate to actor James Franco’s observation: “I don’t even like to sleep—I feel as if there’s too much to do.”</p>
<p>The belief that sleep is a barrier to self-development runs deep in our culture. Dale Carnegie, the father of self-improvement, wrote in the 1930s, “If you can’t sleep, then get up and do something instead of lying there and worrying. It’s the worry that gets you, not the lack of sleep.” But there’s a hitch. FOMO can lead to poor decision making and illness.</p>
<p>“I was proud of working 18 hours a day and sleeping three hours a night,” says rapper and businessman Sean Combs. “It’s something now that has turned into a problem for me: not being able to sleep…having insomnia.”</p>
<p>Entrepreneur <a href="https://esme.com/resources/content/wellness/sleep-evangelist-arianna-huffington-wants-solo-moms-to-join-the-sleep-revolution" target="_blank">Arianna Huffington</a> became a sleep evangelist after a dramatic wake-up call: she collapsed from exhaustion one day. As she fell to the ground, she broke her cheekbone on the corner of a desk. Realizing she’d been sleepwalking through her life, Huffington wrote the book, “<a href="http://ariannahuffington.com/books/the-sleep-revolution-hc" target="_blank">The Sleep Revolution</a>,” which chronicles the global crisis of sleep deprivation and serves as call to action — or rather a call to sleep.</p>
<h2>The Myth of Competitive Advantage</h2>
<p>One of the greatest barriers to combatting our culture of sleep deprivation is the long-held notion that success is linked to burning the midnight oil. Shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis quipped, “If you sleep three hours less each night for a year, you will have an extra month and a half to succeed in.”</p>
<p>But equating lack of sleep with productivity is a slippery slope. Yes, more hours awake may equal more output at the start. But over the long term there are significant risks to your own health and others. For example, <a href="http://amr.aom.org/content/34/1/56.abstract" target="_blank">Barnes and Hollenbeck</a> examined the impact of sleep deprivation on work teams and found a host of negative effects, including a reduced ability to process information, learn, and perform new tasks.</p>
<p>Research undermines the bravado of woraholics. In fact, some of the worst accidents in history, including the Chernobyl and Three-Mile Island nuclear disasters, were caused by team error between the hours of 2-4 a.m., a time when people are especially likely to be sleep deprived. Loss of human life on highways and railways and in our hospitals have been linked to human exhaustion.</p>
<p>Instead of clapping employees on the back for working overtime, it’s time for employers to encourage them to go home and get some rest at the end of their shifts.</p>
<h2>The Good News</h2>
<p>There’s no reason to wear sleep deprivation like a badge of honor. Sleep doesn’t make us miss out or get left behind. It’s the opposite: being well-rested allows us to live richly and experience all life has to offer. So, to quote the title of the best-selling satirical children’s book, “Go the F**k to Sleep!”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>New research suggests our preferred sleep positions influence the brain&#8217;s ability to get rid of metabolic waste, which ultimately affects our overall cognitive function and the manifestation of neurological disease. So, pay attention.</h2>
<p>You may or may not be aware that <strong>our brains engage in a cleansing process that gets rid of metabolic waste when we go sleep</strong>. It&#8217;s called the glymphatic system, and it&#8217;s super cool! Here&#8217;s a brief educational video about how it works from our friends at The University of Rochester Medical School.</p>
<p><span id="more-2443"></span></p>
<h4>The Glymphatic System</h4>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ci5NMscKJws" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s take what you just learned a bit further. According to <a title="How Sleep Position May Affect the Brain" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dailyrx-news/how-sleep-position-may-affect-the-brain_b_7967406.html?utm_hp_ref=healthy-living" target="_blank">Neha Kashyap</a>, reporting for the dailyRx<em>, <strong>&#8220;</strong></em><strong>Researchers from Stony Brook University found that side sleeping, compared to back or stomach sleeping, may more effectively remove brain waste and reduce the risk of Alzheimer&#8217;s, Parkinson&#8217;s and other neurological diseases.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Although the <strong>research has only been conducted in mice the findings are rather promising, even if further investigation is required</strong> to translate them to humans. In a <a title="Could Body Posture During Sleep Affect How Your Brain Clears Waste?" href="http://www.newswise.com/articles/could-body-posture-during-sleep-affect-how-your-brain-clears-waste" target="_blank">press release</a>, the study co-author and professor of neurosurgery at the University of Rochester Medical Center, Maiken Nedergaard, PhD, stated that:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is interesting that the lateral (side) sleep position is already the most popular in human and most animals — even in the wild — and it appears that we have adapted the lateral sleep position to most efficiently clear our brain of the metabolic waste products that built up while we are awake,&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F0p8YFwjpv4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although further research needs to be conducted, this particular study offer an interesting glimpse into the complexity of the brain&#8217;s self-cleaning mechanism. The one thing we can take away from this already is that sufficient slumber is immeasurably helpful for keeping our brains sharper, longer.</p>
<h3>And sleeping on the side may be one of the best ways we can get the maximum benefit our of our sleep.</h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>As a chronic insomniac, I can honestly tell you that getting enough sleep is crucial for anyone, but especially for those battling mental health disorders.</h2>
<p><em>&#8211; by Anonymous Talkspace User  </em></p>
<p>I want you to look back on your life and think about your mood, behavior, and interactions with other people when you’ve had less than 5 hours of sleep. You were probably irritable, highly susceptible to engaging in conflict, and slow in you thinking but quick in your reactions to unpleasant stimuli. Now, imagine being sleep deprived, while also dealing with a mental disorder. Basically, not sleeping can exacerbate any mental condition, making it significantly worse in people who have trouble sleeping as opposed to those that don’t.<span id="more-1923"></span></p>

<p>I’ve had problems with sleep for as long as I can remember. Even in kindergarden, I was wide awake while the children around me enjoyed nap-time. And, for as long as I can remember, I was always the slightly more emotional kid out of the group; prone to crying, fighting, shouting, and then fighting some more. I was always in some kind of trouble, and my parents were on a first name basis with the entire school because of it. Looking back on it now, I would have probably been a much easier child to deal with had I slept more.</p>
<p>Reading <a title="Just One Night Of Bad Sleep Can Alter Your Genes" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bad-sleep-genes_55afa019e4b08f57d5d30bbf?" target="_blank">articles</a> about the importance of sleep has gotten to be comical. Yes, I <em>have </em>noticed how a lack of sleep makes my brain go haywire. Indeed, I <em>have</em> experienced a decline in my cognitive function on sleepless days. Thanks, but I really don’t need <em>another</em> reminder about <a title="Losing 30 Minutes of Sleep Per Day May Promote Weight Gain and Adversely Affect Blood Sugar Control" href="http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/630723/" target="_blank">how much slower my metabolism works after a sleepless night</a>. And, I certainly <em>don’t </em>want to think about how much crappier my skin looks after insomnia hijacks my plans to get some shuteye. But the most dangerous side effect of not getting enough sleep is how it impacts my mental health.</p>
<p>As someone who is constantly struggling to keep my depression, anxiety, and general neurotic behaviors under control, I understand and respect the value of sleep. Not getting enough leaves me unable to distinguish between my own tiredness and the tiredness that results from the influx of stimulation coming from the outside world. For example: I always take the subway to work. When I get enough sleep, I can successfully ignore the screaming crowds and the general rudeness that takes place in and around the NYC transit system. But when I don&#8217;t, I am a lot more prone to confronting people, and getting my butt handed to me in the process.</p>

<p>Although I am in therapy working on getting through some personal stuff, my lack of sleep often dictates how receptive I am to the information my therapist provides me with. Not getting enough sleep can make me defensive or unwilling to accept my own role in my progress. Being well rested, however, helps me get in touch with the abundance of thoughts and feelings that influence my behavior.</p>
<h3>But, and this is a big one, no matter how much work my therapist and I try to get through, the efficacy of these efforts entirely depends on how much sleep I get that night.</h3>

<p>Ever wonder how some of world&#8217;s most incredible people got their beauty sleep? Well, wonder no more. We&#8217;ve found the coolest infographic that breaks down the surprising sleep habits of the rich and famous. Turns out Leonardo Da Vinci utilized a crazy polyphasic sleep cycle, while Richard Branson prefers a fixated block of solid snooze time.<span id="more-1131"></span></p>
<p>We know that sleep is crucial for optimum mental health. Nikola Tesla, for example, didn&#8217;t believe in engaging in down time and suffered a mental breakdown when he was only 25 years old. Luckily he recovered and continued his lifelong innovation competition with Edison, who slept just one hour longer than Tesla. Honestly though, who can even deal with two sleep deprived geniuses on a power trip?</p>
<p>According to <a title="Harvard Medical School" href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/Sleep-and-mental-health" target="_blank">Harvard Medical School</a>: &#8220;Chronic sleep problems affect 50% to 80% of patients in a typical psychiatric practice, compared with 10% to 18% of adults in the general <span class="caps">U.S. </span>population. Sleep problems are particularly common in patients with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (<span class="caps">ADHD</span>).&#8221;</p>
<p>Furthermore, &#8220;the overlap between sleep disorders and various psychiatric problems is so great that researchers have long suspected both types of problems may have common biological roots.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is hardly surprising. A substantial amount of research has been conducted on how lack of sleep may increase the likelihood of a person developing some form of mental illness. This is especially true for people that are already predisposed to it. So, treating the sleep problem can significantly alleviate symptoms of a particular mental disorder, as well as improve the overall quality of life for these individuals.</p>

<p>Not getting enough sleep is actually a major problem for most people. American&#8217;s are notoriously overworked, overstressed, and severely sleep deprived. So, what is the lesson to be learned here?</p>
<h3>America, get some sleep &#8211; like right NOW!</h3>
