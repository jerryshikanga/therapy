				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We can all agree that being a teenager has always been tough. Hormones are changing, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/10-signs-social-anxiety-according-therapist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social anxiety</a> has kicked into high gear, and peer pressure is exerting itself from every angle.</p>
<p>But teens today are facing unique challenges. From <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/managing-social-media-intake-without-quitting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media addiction</a> to social isolation, vaping to the opioid epidemic, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/7-ways-to-deal-with-cyberbullying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cyberbullying</a> to gun violence, Gen Z-ers are coming of age in a whole new world. Most concerning, it’s showing up in their mental health.</p>
<p><span id="more-11321"></span></p>
<p>While today’s teens are the most “connected” generation, research also shows that they’re the loneliest. From 2000 to 2015, the percentage of teens who <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">hang out with their friends almost every day has decreased by over 40 percent</a>. In fact, it’s been discovered that loneliness is <a href="https://www.webmd.com/balance/news/20180504/loneliness-rivals-obesity-smoking-as-health-risk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">as dangerous as smoking 15 cigarettes a day</a>, making it more lethal than the obesity epidemic.</p>
<p>But what makes the mental health crisis for adolescents so acute? How are the problems facing today’s young people different than those facing previous generations? And most importantly: what can we do about it?</p>
<p>These were the questions we sought to answer at our 3rd annual conference <b>Mental Health and Youth: Breakdown or Breakthrough</b>.</p>
<p><iframe width="660" height="371" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dTEK1oBjipg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>The Day’s Key Topics</h2>
<p>The conference was held at the TimesCenter in New York City and featured a first look at the documentary <i>Weight of Gold</i>, with special guests world champion swimmer <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/michael" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Phelps</a> and figure skater Sasha Cohen. The conference also brought together a wide-range of panelists: clinicians from NYU, Columbia, and Harvard as well as technology thought leaders, authors and publishers, and politicians.</p>
<p>Panels included topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p1KCXWbjmU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Early Onset Adulthood</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooITARfCRU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Connected but Alone: Coming of Age in the Social Media Era</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpTXj-bvGg0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Fireside Chat: A Conversation with World Champion Swimmer, Michael Phelps</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyN8r-9iL1A" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Cyberbullying to Gun Violence: How Teens are Coping with Trauma</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_NJiRvktmc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Ready to Leave Home and Face the World</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvaS1eN7Fdw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Weight of Gold: How World-Class Athletes and High-Performance Individuals Connect To Their Mental Health</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The event also served as an opportunity to highlight the dire need of teens underserved by the mental health community. As many as <a href="https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-By-the-Numbers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">half of all lifetime mental illnesses develop by age 14</a>, but only a fraction of those kids and teens receive care.</p>
<p>With the hope of helping to mitigate it, we announced a partnership with <a href="https://giveanhour.org/talkspace-launches-new-platform-offering-affordable-mental-healthcare-for-teens-partners-with-give-an-hour/" target="”_blank”">Give an Hour</a>, a non-profit mental health organization that provides free access to care for populations that desperately need it. Together, our organizations are offering 500 months of free therapy to teens in need of behavioral health care.</p>
<h2>Announcing Talkspace for Teens</h2>
<p>And, finally, Talkspace announced that it will be providing services, with parental consent, to teens between the ages of 13-17. Now, with <a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/talkspace-for-teens">Talkspace for Teens</a>, young people can receive the benefits of professional counseling without having to divulge sensitive problems to teachers or friends.</p>
<p>Receiving mental health care will no longer necessitate leaving school early or missing activities — Talkspace for Teens provides adolescents a new kind of space online, one where they can express themselves authentically, securely, and confidentially.</p>
<p>The conference was a day to discuss some of the most pressing questions facing young people — a fascinating, deep dive into the relationships between mental health, social media, substance abuse, and gun control. Our hope is that it provided some solutions as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Talkspace CEO Oren Frank addressed the audience at <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/future-of-therapy-2016/" target="_blank">our company’s clinical conference, The Future of Therapy</a>, one of his opening lines was something no one expected.</p>
<p>“Over ten years ago, Roni actually left me,” Frank said</p>
<p>The crowd went silent. Frank’s wife, Talkspace Co-Founder and Head of Clinical Services <a href="http://beautyandwellbeing.com/well-being/interview-well-being/talking-roni-frank-co-founder-talkspace/" target="_blank">Roni Frank</a>, had finished <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/04/talkspace-co-founder-roni-frank-talks-disrupting-stigma-and-the-futureoftherapy/" target="_blank">her speech</a> only minutes earlier.<span id="more-4062"></span></p>
<p>Oren had not prepared a formal speech, so no one knew what he would talk about. To the audience, his family and his staff, every word was a surprise.</p>
<p>His wife smiled, proud of her husband for engaging the audience in an interesting way.</p>
<p>“This was the point in life where we met Iris,” Frank continued, scanning the seats for his long-time couples therapist, Iris Reitzes.</p>
<p>“This is where Roni and myself fell in love with the profession called therapy or psychotherapy.”</p>
<p>After working with Reitzes, Oren and Roni built a happy marriage and raised two daughters. Roni left her career as a software developer to pursue psychology and the couple moved from Israel to the United States.</p>
<p>Oren wondered why the psychotherapy that had helped him was not more affordable and accessible. He spoke of the “American Dream” that had motivated him to immigrate.</p>
<blockquote><p>“For millions of people, it’s an American Nightmare.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Because of high prices, inaccessibility and flaws in the health care system, these people suffer with mental health issues and do not receive help.</p>
<p>To bypass this broken system, Oren and Roni designed Talkspace to work directly with the consumer. Clients don’t need health insurance to use Talkspace and can sign up quickly.</p>
<p>Oren believed connecting with therapists in any form was more important than the modality of therapy, so he and Roni wanted Talkspace to offer multiple mediums: text, video, audio and more. They did not intend to replace in person therapy, but they did believe Talkspace was necessary to help the millions of people who could not see a therapist in an office.</p>
<p>“Half of the people using Talkspace have never been to therapy before, and would have never gone to therapy if Talkspace did not exist. For us, this is the fulfillment of what we are setting out to do.”</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-4065 alignright" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/oren-frank-quote-secondary_300W_JR.jpg" alt="oren frank quote Talkspace" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/oren-frank-quote-secondary_300W_JR.jpg 300w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/oren-frank-quote-secondary_300W_JR-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Despite this success, Oren still encounters people who do not think therapy is valid. One of his reasons for hosting the conference was to eradicate these doubts.</p>
<p>“We are here to say, ‘Yeah. Therapy is amazing.’ We want to make sure people understand that, and this is a method for us to fight stigma and remove it.”</p>
<p>Another motivation for hosting the conference was seeking help from other companies in the health care space that are innovating to provide more accessible care. These companies include Oscar Health, Mobile Health Interventions, PillPack, Pager and Stride Health.</p>
<p>“The real common aim, or target, or goal of all of us is that alleged and beautiful human condition we want to help with, and we want to help the helpers.”</p>
<p>On that note, the conference commenced.</p>
