				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you have a serious mental illness like bipolar disorder, navigating relationships can be difficult. Not only is it difficult to overcome the self-limiting factors those with bipolar disorder may place on themselves, but it’s difficult to get over the limitations that may externally be placed on a person with bipolar disorder. These are challenges that can feel impossible to overcome but people with bipolar disorder can have social and intimate relationships, and what’s more, doing so can even improve their mental health.</p>
<p><span id="more-8805"></span></p>
<h2>Internal Struggles of Those with Bipolar and Relationships</h2>
<p>If you have a very serious illness that requires daily care, this impacts your ability to make connections with others. This statement is obvious to many, but few people have thought about it through the lens of a mentally ill person.</p>
<p>The first thing that may challenge a person with bipolar disorder to create relationships is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26208983" target="_blank">self-stigma (or internalized stigma) </a>leading to self-created isolation. Self-stigma is where a person internalizes the negative messages he or she receives about those with mental illness. It is a state wherein people feel bad about themselves and have low self-esteem because society’s messages about bipolar disorder and other mental illnesses tend to be so derogatory. When a person feels bad about him or herself it can be very difficult to initiate connections with others. People with bipolar, then, may avoid relationships simply because they don’t feel good enough for other people. Sometimes these feelings even come on quickly and cause those with mental illnesses to push away others in existing relationships. This can lead to social isolation.</p>
<p>The second thing that may impact the ability of a person with bipolar disorder  to have relationships is routine. Those with a mental illness may rely heavily on a routine for wellness. This may mean going to bed early, sleeping longer than average, scheduling meals precisely, not being able to skip exercising and more. A strict schedule containing many of these components may force the person with bipolar to forgo nighttime gatherings, parties, places where alcohol is served, and other events that don’t fit into his or her timetable.</p>
<p>It’s also important to remember that the symptoms of a mood disorder – uncontrolled periods of severe mood changes – can also cause breaks, either temporary or long-term, in relationships.</p>
<h2>External Struggles of Relationships and Bipolar Disorder</h2>
<p>Moreover, not only do some people with bipolar disorder feel bad about themselves because of the negative societal messages about mental illness, but others may feel that those with bipolar disorder are lesser-than as well. Prevalent messages about those with bipolar disorder include:</p>
<ul>
<li>People with bipolar disorder can’t be trusted.</li>
<li>People with bipolar disorder can’t be sexually faithful.</li>
<li>People with bipolar disorder are violent or dangerous.</li>
<li>People with bipolar disorder are unpredictable.</li>
<li>People with bipolar disorder are manipulative.</li>
<li>People with bipolar disorder can’t control their anger.</li>
</ul>
<p>These messages and so many others may make people look at those with bipolar disorder as unsuitable for relationships of any type. These myths place a wall between those with bipolar disorder and others. This can lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forced isolation from peer groups.</li>
<li>Relationships being abandoned once a bipolar disorder diagnosis is discovered</li>
<li>Every problem in a relationship being blamed on bipolar disorder.</li>
<li>Social pressure not to be in a relationships with a person with bipolar disorder.</li>
<li>Discrimination against those with bipolar disorder.</li>
<li>Abuse against those with bipolar disorder.</li>
</ul>
<p>So not only are people with bipolar disorder faced with feeling bad about themselves, but they are also faced with others’ prejudice against them as well. In this environment it’s no wonder that those with bipolar disorder find relationships difficult.</p>
<h2>The Benefits of Relationships for Those with Bipolar Disorder</h2>
<p>Nevertheless, this does not mean that people with bipolar disorder don’t want relationships. Many with bipolar disorder do want social connections with others.</p>
<p>Additionally, putting effort into relationships is definitely worthwhile for a person’s health. Social relationships are known as protective factors when it comes to health. In fact, studies actually show an <a href="https://search.proquest.com/openview/8f278e701a1471be367d9f7176f696e1/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=1256" target="_blank">increased risk of death </a>among those with few social relationships. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-005-0865-6" target="_blank">One study </a>found, “lower levels of social embeddedness and social support increased the relative rate of suicide attempt.” Both <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3150158/" target="_blank">short- and long-term effects from relationships </a>are felt on mental health, health behavior and physical health.</p>
<h2>So What’s a Person with Bipolar Disorder to Do About Relationships?</h2>
<p>It’s not easy to overcome the hurdles of relationships presented to those with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>The key thing to remember is not to generalize and that those with bipolar disorder cannot be judged as a group any more than any other group. One person with bipolar disorder may have trouble controlling his or her anger, but this doesn’t mean that all with bipolar disorder do. One person with bipolar disorder may have a string of relationships in which he or she hurts the other person, but certainly, not all people with bipolar disorder do. Internalizing the idea that you will hurt others because of a mental illness is simply false and defeating, as is the notion that someone with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder will hurt you simply because of a medical condition.</p>
<p>No one would suggest that those with cancer make substandard social connections because of their illness and no one should assume that might be the case because of a mental illness either.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1997 I was a happy person. I had recently moved to a new city with my then-boyfriend, gotten a little distance from my family, and started attending university. I was working toward a bachelor’s of computer science. It was challenging, but I was handling it and feeling uplifted by the challenge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was used to a roller-coaster of moods through my earlier teenage years, but I thought that turbulence was behind me. I had no idea anything was brewing in my brain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, by the end of 1998, my mental health had reached its breaking point. I had slid, little by little, into the vortex of a severe <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/dealing-depression-need-know/">depression</a>. By that time I was wishing for death every day, could barely get out of bed, and had turned to self-harm for some small measure of relief. I had no idea why these things were happening to me as nothing notable had preceded them, but they were obviously happening — brutally.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-6792"></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bipolar Disorder, Not Major Depression</span></h2>
<p>One night I decided to face my fears and research what was happening to me. I searched site after site and, of course, ran into the definition of major depression everywhere.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then, on one of the sites, I ran into the definition of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/know-kind-bipolar/" target="_blank">bipolar disorder</a>. While I knew I was in a severe depression now, I also knew that in I had experienced times that seemed an awful lot like hypomania. By the time I had printed off a tree’s worth of information about the condition and cried a tissue box worth of tears, I suspected that I knew what was wrong with me — I had bipolar disorder.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diagnostic Disagreement</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I got in front of a psychiatrist, I told him I had bipolar disorder and why I thought so. But the doctor disagreed. Even though I was severely suicidal, self-harming, and could barely function, he diagnosed me with “minor depression.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he said those words, I felt very strongly that he was wrong. But I didn’t have the confidence to stand up for myself because I was so depressed. I was intimidated by the doctor and his years of experience. So when he said “minor depression,” I said, “OK.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He treated me with antidepressants that — not surprisingly — didn’t work. In the back of my mind, I knew he was treating me for the wrong disorder. Not only did I know there was nothing “minor” about my depression, I also knew I had bipolar disorder.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding Bipolar Hypomania</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hypomania is different for everyone. One person’s hypomania might be close to another person’s normal. For this reason it’s critical, as a patient, to evaluate your own mood carefully. You are the only one who will be able to detect a mood that is “higher” than your normal because you’re the only one who knows what your normal is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes it is difficult for a third party to detect hypomania. Who knows whether your energy level is “too high?” You do. Who knows if you’re talking more than normal, faster than normal? You do. Who knows if your behavior is abnormal for you? You do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For me it was all obvious. I could remember distinct times, going back to my childhood, where I was just too high. I could remember talking so much and so fast that others didn’t understand what I was saying and told me to slow down. I could remember times when I felt incredibly brilliant and “greater” than everyone else. All these were clear signs of hypomania, but they were not clear enough to my psychiatrist. In the end, I felt he didn’t ask the right questions to get to the bottom of either my severe depression or the presence of hypomania. (Although, to be fair, bipolar disorder was not his specialty and back in 1998, bipolar type II — which contains the presence of hypomania — was not so readily screened for.)</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting The Correct Diagnosis</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually I got lucky. My doctor went on his summer vacation and I had to see someone else. This new doctor listened to me when I said I had <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/knew-bipolar-disorder/">bipolar disorder </a>and started to treat me for it. I don’t know what would have happened if that particular doctor hadn’t walked into my life, but I suspect it would have been years of incorrect treatment and ill health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, getting this correct diagnosis didn’t magically make me better. It still took more than a year to find a medication that worked for me. But sure enough, it was a medication for bipolar disorder, and not one for major depression, that worked. If I had not received the right diagnosis, I could not have started that long process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I learned is that while psychiatrists know a tremendous amount about the brain and mental illness, they can’t see inside </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">your</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> brain and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">your</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mental illness. Certainly, diagnosing yourself is dangerous and would lead to a high rate of failure due to lack of medical training, experience, and knowledge. But it’s important to make sure your doctor listens to you and you feel good about their understanding of the symptoms you’re describing when making their assessment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mistake I made was being far too timid to express what I thought and why. I waited for him to ask the right questions instead of me presenting what I had experienced. This was not my fault. In a perfect world, we both would have done a better job.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dealing With The Incorrect Diagnosis</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you feel like you have the wrong diagnosis, you need to get a second opinion and a second complete assessment. I was lucky that the second doctor didn’t rubber stamp the first diagnosis – which can often happen – so you may have to fight for a thorough second assessment. Fighting to get yourself heard is crucial. Without that key, correct diagnosis, your chances of finding an effective treatment are much slimmer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stand up for yourself. Advocate for yourself. Psychiatrists can only help you once they understand the problems you’re facing. For a second opinion, consider working with a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a> as well.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are multiple types of <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/bipolar-disorder/index.shtml#part_145402" target="_blank">bipolar disorder</a> — a disorder known as an affective or mood disorder. The three main types are: bipolar disorder type I, bipolar disorder type II and cyclothymia. Also, there are certain additional “specifiers” that denote particular types of symptoms seen in each bipolar mood.</p>
<p>Bipolar disorder <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/286342-overview#showall" target="_blank">appears evenly in men and women</a>. Women, however, are more likely to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder type II. Women are also more likely to experience mixed episodes (see below) and a “rapid cycling” version of the illness where the person experiences more than four mood episodes per year.</p>
<h2>Bipolar Disorder Type I</h2>
<p>Bipolar disorder type I is what people tend to think of when they imagine bipolar disorder (previously known as manic depression). It is made of up a very elevated mood known as “mania” and a very low mood called “depression.”</p>
<p>A person with bipolar disorder type I experiences these moods episodically. He or she may experience a manic episode for two months followed by a three-month depression followed by a symptom-free period (known as euthymia).<span id="more-6006"></span></p>
<p><strong>Bipolar Mania</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://psychcentral.com/disorders/manic-episode/" target="_blank">Manic episodes</a> feature at least one week of profound mood disturbance characterized by elation, irritability, or expansiveness (euphoria with delusions of grandeur). At least three of the following symptoms must also be present:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grandiosity</li>
<li>Diminished need for sleep</li>
<li>Excessive talking or pressured speech</li>
<li>Racing thoughts or flight of ideas</li>
<li>Clear evidence of distractibility</li>
<li>Increased level of goal-focused activity at home, at work or sexually</li>
<li>Excessive pleasurable activities, often with painful consequences</li>
</ul>
<p>The mood disturbance is sufficient to cause impairment at work or endanger the person or others. The mood is not the result of substance abuse or a medical condition.</p>
<p><strong>Bipolar Depression</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/depression-symptoms#1" target="_blank">Bipolar depression</a> has the same criteria as major depressive disorder. Major depressive episodes are characterized as: for the same two weeks, the person experiences five or more of the following symptoms, with at least one of the symptoms being either a depressed mood or characterized by a loss of pleasure or interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Depressed mood</li>
<li>Markedly diminished pleasure or interest in nearly all activities</li>
<li>Significant weight loss or gain or significant loss or increase in appetite</li>
<li>Hypersomnia or insomnia</li>
<li>Psychomotor retardation or agitation</li>
<li>Loss of energy or fatigue</li>
<li>Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt</li>
<li>Decreased concentration ability or marked indecisiveness</li>
<li>Preoccupation with death or suicide; the person has a plan or has attempted suicide</li>
</ul>
<p>These symptoms cause significant impairment and distress and are not the result of substance abuse or a medical condition.</p>
<p><strong>Bipolar Disorder and Psychosis</strong></p>
<p>People with bipolar disorder type I also commonly experience <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/psychosis" target="_blank">psychosis</a>. Psychosis is a “break with reality.” It is typically the presence of delusions and/or hallucinations. Delusions are false beliefs (such as the belief you are being followed by the police everywhere you go), and hallucinations are experiences that have not happened.</p>
<p>Hallucinations can happen with any sense. For example, you may see something that doesn’t exist or feel a tactile sensation for no reason. People can experience psychosis while in a mania or major depression.</p>
<p>Note: Experiencing psychosis has nothing to do with being a psychopath.</p>
<h2>Bipolar Disorder Type II</h2>
<p>Bipolar disorder type II is made up of two kinds of moods: major depression and hypomania. The criteria for the major depressive mood is identical to what it is in bipolar disorder type I. Hypomania actually has the same basic criteria as bipolar mania but it is less severe. Just like with bipolar disorder type I, this disorder is episodic.</p>
<p>While some characterize bipolar type II as “less severe.” this isn’t true. Bipolar type II does contain a less severe version of mania known as hypomania, but the illness itself is not less severe or impairing. This is mostly because people with bipolar type II spend significantly more time in a major depressive state than do people with bipolar disorder type I.</p>
<p><strong>Bipolar Hypomania</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://psychcentral.com/disorders/hypomanic-episode-symptoms/" target="_blank">Hypomanic episodes</a> are characterized by an elevated, expansive, or irritable mood of at least four consecutive days duration. At least three of the following symptoms are also present:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grandiosity or inflated self-esteem</li>
<li>Diminished need for sleep</li>
<li>Pressured speech</li>
<li>Racing thoughts or flight of ideas</li>
<li>Clear evidence of distractibility</li>
<li>Increased level of goal-focused activity at home, at work, or sexually</li>
<li>Engaging in activities with a high potential for painful consequences</li>
</ul>
<p>The mood disturbance is observable to others. The mood is not the result of substance abuse or a medical condition. The episode is not severe enough to cause social or occupational impairment.</p>
<p>People with bipolar disorder type I can also experience hypomania, often as a precursor to full-blown mania.</p>
<p>Note that people with bipolar disorder type II do not experience psychosis.</p>
<h2>Bipolar Mixed Episodes</h2>
<p>A mixed mood is the occurrence of some of the elevated and low symptoms of bipolar disorder at the same time. Some symptoms of mania occur with symptoms of depression, or some symptoms of hypomania occur with symptoms of depression.</p>
<p>In the latest version of the “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition,” “mixed features” is now a specifier that can be applied to any mood. Any type of bipolar disorder can experience it. Mixed moods are particularly dangerous in bipolar disorder because they carry a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27618746" target="_blank">high risk of suicide</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Cyclothymia</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cyclothymia/basics/definition/con-20028763" target="_blank">Cyclothymia</a> is a diagnosis given to those who experience symptoms of both hypomania and depression episodically but do not meet the full criteria for mania, hypomania, or major depression. It is sort of like bipolar “light” but can still be debilitating depending on how a person experiences it.</p>
<h2>Other Specifiers in Bipolar Disorder</h2>
<p>In addition to the mixed features specifier, a mood in any type of bipolar disorder can also be specified to contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anxious distress</li>
<li>Rapid cycling</li>
<li>Mood-congruent psychotic features</li>
<li>Catatonia (typically muscle rigidity and mental stupor)</li>
<li>Peripartum onset (occurring during the last month of pregnancy or the first few months after delivery)</li>
<li>Seasonal pattern (often known as <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/10/basics-sad-can-treat/" target="_blank">seasonal affective disorder [SAD]</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Do You Know What Type of Bipolar You Have?</h2>
<p>The best way to know which type of bipolar disorder you have is, of course, to get a formal diagnosis from a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">psychotherapist</a> or psychiatrist. But if you’re looking at the issue on your own, keep in mind that one of the main differences is psychosis. If you experience psychosis, then you’d likely be diagnosed with bipolar disorder type I. If your elevated moods are less than a week, then you likely would be diagnosed with bipolar disorder type II. If you don’t quite fit the diagnostic criteria for major depression or hypomania/mania, then you would likely be diagnosed with cyclothymia.</p>
<p>No matter what version of bipolar disorder you have, it’s important to take it seriously and get treatment. The most effective way of treating bipolar disorder is with both <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a> and medication combined.</p>

<p>Recently I began experiencing symptoms of hypomania. I was irritable, had the sex drive of a teenage boy, and felt euphoric. I knew something was off with me. I hadn’t felt this way before, not to this extent. I contacted my psychiatrist and made an appointment. He confirmed that I was experiencing hypomania, and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type II.</p>
<p>It was a relief to know what was happening. Nonetheless, I was frightened because — unlike what the media portrays — mania isn’t fun. It’s exhausting and scary.</p>
<p>You do feel temporarily euphoric, at least I did. The feeling of mania is surreal and sometimes wonderful, but other times terrifying. It makes you feel out of sorts and a different version of yourself. I feel pressured to speak quickly, keep moving and keep doing things until my body can’t take it anymore. It’s awful and I don’t wish these feelings on anyone.</p>
<p>Mania isn’t wonderful. It’s a terrible feeling that impacts people living with bipolar disorder.<span id="more-5684"></span></p>
<p>I had to ride out these symptoms and my medication was adjusted. The antidepressant I had been taking was pushing me into a manic state. It was scary to change medications, but I knew my doctor was making the right recommendation.</p>
<p>There was something that kept bothering me, though. I was told:</p>
<p>“You have bipolar disorder.”</p>
<p>It was as if I was at the grocery store and someone put something in my cart I had no interest in buying or eating. Bipolar disorder was placed into my brain cart, and I wanted to reject it. I wanted to return it.</p>
<p>Part of it was because I had trouble separating “living with bipolar disorder” and “being bipolar.” I didn’t want to be bipolar. Bipolar is not me, and I needed to figure out how to integrate this diagnosis into my life in a way that made sense to me.</p>
<p>Being the overly analytical person I am, I thought long and hard about this and came to a conclusion: I am NOT bipolar, but rather I experience symptoms of bipolar disorder. I experience hypomania and depression at times. These are facts that enter into my consciousness, and that is OK. I ride that manic rollercoaster until it stops and then I get off it. It’s exhausting and scary at times, but there is no choice.</p>
<p>Getting the diagnosis of bipolar disorder was a sort of self-discovery. I learned the reasons behind my behavior, and I was able to have a better understanding of why I behave the way I do. It was informative and helped me to be a more self-aware person.</p>
<p>I know why my moods go up and down, and I understand why I can irritable at times. I’m not acting this way on purpose, but rather they are a result of the brain chemistry I have. That is freeing in some ways. I can’t control what my brain does, but I can work hard to understand it and work with it as opposed to fighting against it.</p>
<p>I am so much more than a diagnosis. I am a human being who happens to live with bipolar disorder. I am a mother, an advocate, a writer, a friend, a daughter and a compassionate person. I try to help as many people as I can, and to do that I need to be as self-aware as possible. I’m committed to knowing my idiosyncrasies and myself. My mission is to help others who are living with a variety of mental illnesses, including bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Know that you are more than a DSM-V diagnosis. You are a conglomeration of beautiful attributes and I support you for being who you are. Who you are is a beautiful person.</p>
<p>If you happen to have a mental illness, that does not distract from your beauty, but rather it is one part of you that exists. Keep fighting and, most importantly, keep being WHO YOU ARE. I know I will.</p>
