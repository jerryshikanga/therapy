				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My wife is sick. Stage Four sick. I must hurry home and relieve her parents who have been caring for her since I left for work at 9 a.m. and for our three-year old son since his pre-school day ended at 2 p.m. It is 6:30 p.m., but I am not rushing through the front door.</p>
<p>Instead, I am lying on a massage table in the back room of our local nail salon, trying not to audibly cry as my masseuse works on the knot under my right shoulder blade. The knot is excruciating, but that is not why my tears soak the paper cover of the table. I do not know her name, but I do know that she always works on Tuesday nights and I know this as well— she does not tie back her thick dark hair. My wife had thick dark hair before the chemo.</p>
<p>I cannot define this desire; this deep longing for another woman’s hair to tickle my back. Is this a form of adultery? Of exploitation? To pay a thick-haired stranger to soothe me in this way? Do I take advantage of my wife’s parents? Do I neglect my son who is scared and sad and needs me to come home? Because I will be late. I will blame my boss or the subway or the rain before I cop to this 20-minute reprieve. I am ashamed. I am defiant. But I know what I need.<span id="more-8348"></span></p>
<p>She died on May 15, 2012. Ten days before her 52nd birthday. The last time we made love was Valentine’s day 2011. Four months before her diagnosis. Uterine cancer. It explained a lot about her increasing lack of interest in sex. I didn’t just feel guilty about the shit I had given her about not “wanting” me— I tortured myself. There was now a loop in my brain of her saying, “I just haven’t felt like myself lately.” In what ways did that Valentine’s Day lovemaking cost her? She had strewn the apartment with rose petals and bought a bouquet for our boy to hand me when I walked in the door. I now know that we had sex that night only for me and not for her at all. Was she okay with that? Am I?</p>
<p><em>“I don’t want to offend you.” I type into Facebook Messenger. “I don’t even know if you’re seeing someone. But I feel like we have a spark and I really need to have sex.”</em></p>
<p>It had only been three months since she died. I used to love our family weekends together, but now I spent weekends fighting the urge to crawl back into bed and sleep forever. My son and I held on tight, but couldn’t quite face each other. He was acting out and he was left out: suddenly not invited to friends’ birthday parties, shunned by the children in our community garden, reprimanded by his teachers and separated from the other kids in the pre-school where he had gone from being the cool, goofy boy with two moms to the difficult kid with one dead mother and another who walked around like a zombie.</p>
<p>We had no break from each other’s grief.</p>
<p>My only escape was sexual fantasy, which had become my morning coffee and my afternoon cocktail. Masturbation and Xanax lulled me to sleep at night. But here was the weird part — I could not bear the thought of sex with another woman. Picturing the kissing and touching of another female body only made me cry out for her — my love, my wife of 14 years (although, in a cruel trick of political timing, only the last one was legally sanctioned by New York State). I could not think of another woman without missing her so much I could barely breathe.</p>
<p>Yet, part of me kept thinking, “I can totally have sex now!”</p>
<p>I’d been with many men before I met her. It was my young body’s perpetual quest for the elusive complete experience. I finally found that completion (the magic equation of genuine arousal plus true intimacy) when I fell in love with a woman. I thought I finally knew who I was. I loved being a lesbian. I never looked back.</p>
<p>Now I found myself lunching with Alice,* one of my wife’s best friends and a die-hard sapphist with no sexual experience of men. I told her I was seriously considering propositioning this ex-boyfriend with whom, after years of no contact, I found myself Facebook flirting. “If I were you,” she said, “I’d definitely pick a man.” Permission granted as far as I was concerned. Desperation often makes for a simplistic world view.</p>
<p><em>“I’m not offended,” Brian, the ex, writes back, “I’m not seeing anyone. And now I have an erection.” I blush and laugh. It feels so human to want and be wanted.</em></p>
<p>I hired a babysitter. I booked a hotel room. I pushed back against feelings of adulterous shame and of wasting my money and “abandoning&#8221; my child, with the same ferocious defiance that had propelled me to the nail salon on Tuesday nights.</p>
<p>I had taken a bus out to the little town where he worked backstage at a Summer stock theatre and where I had to sit through a terrible production of Barefoot in the Park before heading for the hotel. I spent the first act critiquing the leads who had no sexual chemistry. The “odd couple” premise of the play does not work unless the central characters are super-hot for each other. Was I super-hot for Brian? I couldn’t tell anymore. At that point, my strongest urge was to get it over with.</p>
<p>At intermission and all through Act II the only thing I wanted to do was call my wife. She and I had always checked in multiple times during the day to report on some random quirky detail of life. This particular situation was quirky but not at all random. I had created it. Why?</p>
<p>When we knew she was dying she told me she wanted me to find someone to love, but I don’t think she ever envisioned me in a depressing hotel room in rural Pennsylvania with, as she would have put it, “some dude.” If the sex had been good that night I probably would have thanked Brian and moved on. It seemed wrong to have rough, male hands on my body. I did not know how to touch him. Intercourse felt like losing my virginity all over again. So, I continued to meet and touch and seek again the complete experience.</p>
<p>As things got better between us physically I sunk deeper into depressive inertia. He wanted it all with me and that was the last thing I wanted. At night, I would put my son to bed then sob uncontrollably in the shower, longing for my wife to show me a sign, then emerge scrubbed clean and cried out. I would take Brian in my bed then kick him out when we were finished. I did not want my son to find him there. I could not bear to fall asleep together.</p>
<p>I wish I could say the ending was clean. I wish I could say I was not unkind. But the older I get the more I am convinced that endings tend to be messy and cruel. So many of us messy humans find the courage to leave the wrong relationship only after we’ve had a taste of a right one.</p>
<p>For me, that taste came in the beautiful form of one of my oldest and dearest friends who, after years of being my exacting writing buddy and insightful confidante, after decades of us trusting and wanting the best for each other, proposed that we come together and express our feelings sexually.</p>
<p>The first time I was nervous but not terrified. I somehow knew the encounter would be complete. Our middle-aged bodies fit together perfectly as we shared kisses and laughter and later, a holy communion of knowing and being known. I did not once feel the urge to call my wife, but I did need to talk about her. And talk we did. And listen. And touch. And make love. And talk again. This friend, this man (yes, man) knows grief and loss. He knows his own and he understands mine. And our bodies heal each other again and again.</p>
<p>So, am I still a lesbian? Bisexual? I don’t know what I am. But I know who I am. I am a widow. And I am in love. As I strive to understand it all, my sexuality has evolved from being my defiant, shameful secret, to my strong and loyal ally.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been nearly four years since I left my ex-husband. When I think back to that time, I think about how naive I was, how foggy and confused. I had never heard of a personality disorder. I still believed that dangerous people would be easy to spot, that they came wielding chain saws and screaming, “I’m a dangerous person!”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sigh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There was so much I did not know.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-6776"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After abuse in my marriage escalated from emotional to physical, a friend suggested that I google “antisocial personality disorder,” which I did, and then I spent the next few weeks glued to the Internet. My learning curve was massive. I felt like a billion light bulbs had cleared the fog from my brain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I found an online trove of information — acronyms, terminologies, descriptions of people who sounded </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">exactly </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">like my husband. Of course I knew my husband was often aggressive and irritable, acted without thinking first, and behaved irresponsibly at work and at home. Additionally, he was not friends with any of his ex-girlfriends, responded to stories about others’ pain with a disturbing lack of empathy, and — come to think of it — I had never witnessed him apologize to anyone in the six years we were together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the idea that my husband could have a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">personality disorder </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">— one of the hardest to treat, one that is often referred to in popular culture as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sociopathy </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">— absolutely floored me. Though I was relieved that I had not been imagining his unsettling behaviors, I was also devastated because a personality-disorder diagnosis meant that my husband’s behavior would likely never improve without his own deep commitment to do so. Believe me when I say that he was in total denial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re involved with someone with sociopathic behavior, then you know this: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">going through</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">divorce with a person suffering from antisocial personality disorder is not like any other</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. People with this disorder are callously numb to others’ feelings; lack guilt or remorse after treating people in their lives poorly; and who are, in sum, highly abusive. They will act charming at the beginning of a relationship and then manipulate their partner once they’ve drawn them in, at which point they violate their partner&#8217;s boundaries with impunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back, I had no idea what I was in for when I left my husband: police reports, restraining orders, custody evaluations, and supervised visitation requests to protect my children. The journey of leaving someone with antisocial personality disorder is a seemingly never-ending path of stress, exhaustion,</span><a href="https://esme.com/resources/content/bereavement" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, confusion, and fear. And for those of us who share children with someone who has this disorder, that stress, grief, and fear are magnified exponentially.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to note that psychologists and psychiatrists typically are not allowed to diagnose an individual without working with that person on a therapeutic level, and many people could exhibit some of the characteristics discussed here without fitting all the criteria to be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder. Also important is being able to identify the relevant sociopathic behaviors your spouse has exhibited, recognize them for the abusive tactics they are, and take appropriate action to protect yourself and your kids and get your life back. So from one </span><a href="https://esme.com/voices/perspectives/whats-a-solo-mom" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solo Mom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the trenches to other women out there who are also in the trenches, here are some ways to keep your sanity while in the process of divorcing a sociopath.</span></p>
<h2>Seek Out Resources</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the aggression and violence that people with antisocial personality disorder typically unleash on the people around them, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">especially</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their spouse, children, or both it is very important that you seek out local and national organizations that can help validate the abuse and trauma you’ve survived; connect you with resources you may need, such as food, shelter, counseling, child care, health care, legal aid, and information about other appropriate social-services programs you may qualify for; and help you strategize what your postdivorce life will look like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can start by googling domestic-violence shelters, LGBTQ centers, organizations that help people with disabilities, any relevant religious or spiritual communities, and, if applicable, low-income health, immigration, and legal-aid clinics. It is very important to cultivate a network of professionals whose job is to help you create what is called a “safety plan” to figure out what steps you need to take to regain your autonomy and peace of mind. </span><a href="http://www.thehotline.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Domestic Violence Hotline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, offers a 24/7 hotline as well as an online chat system so if you still live in the same space as or are in close proximity to your abuser, you can seek help without your abuser knowing. These resources will be very important not only in leaving but also in thriving during and after the divorce process.</span></p>
<h2>Record, Document, And Document Some More</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you are forced to orbit around someone with antisocial personality disorder, manipulation and gaslighting are par for the course. Documentation will become an important lifeline. Because my short-term memory had become so foggy from years of sociopathic abuse,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">during my custody battle I relied heavily on my Google Calendar and journal to remind me not only of what had happened in the years prior but also what was happening just a few days earlier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been down this road for a while, you’re aware of how onerous documenting is. It’s something extra to do on top of all the other tasks for which you’re responsible. It feels like the sociopathic person not only is manipulating you and your children but also infringing on your free time, your ability to relax and enjoy your life, and your brainpower. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">But whatever you do, keep documenting. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember to take extra steps to keep this documentation private and away from the violence of your abuser as best you can. Make sure to reach out immediately to mental-health professionals, social workers, family members, friends, and anyone else you feel you can trust if at any time you feel like your life or the lives of your children are being threatened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unfortunate part of sharing children with a sociopathic abuser means you likely will find yourself back in court. And depending on the state of your abuser’s</span><a href="https://esme.com/resources/content/work-and-finances" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> finances</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you might be back in court </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">often</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Your job as the stable, responsible parent is to document every single time the abuser is late for visits, says manipulative things to your child on the phone, threatens anyone’s safety, or violates boundaries in other ways. Whether you choose to record your notes in a journal, send yourself an email, or make a voice recording, your documentation could prove essential to your future case. Also, check recording laws in your state. If you live in a “one-party consent” state, you can legally record phone calls and conversations in which you are also a participant.</span></p>
<h2>Stick To The plan</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have made a safety plan for how you will be proceeding in the divorce and what you need to do to rebuild your life into something better (there’s a light at the end of the tunnel — I promise!), you will need this plan to be made of steel. A spouse with antisocial personality disorder thrives on controlling, dominating, and humiliating you, and therefore has already conditioned you slowly over time to relinquish more and more control over your boundaries while tearing down your self-esteem until you think you couldn’t possibly deserve better. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This toxic manipulation is all part of the plan to keep you under his or her thumb. So always, always, always </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">stick to the plan</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Don’t believe that this time your abuser has finally changed or “seen the light.” Don’t give in to the person’s taunts, tears, or promises for a better life. He or she has done enough damage already, and as hard as it may be to test out your newly established boundaries and flex your autonomy muscles, your life and your children’s lives are what matter now. If you don’t do this, your abuser will attempt to interpret and exploit any fuzzy boundaries to his or her benefit. Save yourself.</span></p>
<h2>Natural Consequences</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When divorcing someone with sociopathic tendencies, it can be useful to think about applying the basic principles of love-and-logic parenting but modifying them to accommodate the out-of-control toddler living inside the body of this grown person known as the sociopathic abuser. Repeat after me: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">natural consequences, natural consequences, natural consequences.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In parenting speak, this means that if Johnny forgets his soccer uniform, he can’t play in the game. In divorcing-a-sociopathic-abuser speak, this means that if the abuser is two days late confirming his or her parenting time, he or she will have to wait until next week and speak to your divorce lawyer in the meantime. It all boils down to boundaries.</span></p>
<h2>Don’t Feed The Sociopathy</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sociopathic people feed on chaos and energy. As such, the sociopathic abuser will be looking to steamroll you at every opportunity. He or she will create mountains out of molehills, ignore court orders, delay filling out divorce forms and getting paperwork notarized in a timely fashion. Your abuser might refuse to communicate entirely (like mine) or send a dozen emails of rambling nonsense on a daily basis. As much as possible, find a way to let the small stuff roll off your back while forwarding any threatening and aggressive content you receive to your lawyer and all other pertinent people who are part of your safety plan.</span></p>
<h2>Email Only</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The general rule of thumb when detaching from someone with antisocial personality disorder is to go “no contact,” which means exactly what it sounds like: no communication whatsoever. But when you’re in the middle of a divorce, especially if you share a child with this person, “no contact” is harder to achieve. As much as possible, refuse to engage. Insist on written communication only. The abuser will fight this (mine still does) because he or she knows it’s much easier to disorient someone over the phone or in person than via email. (Again, boundaries and documentation!) Stand your ground.</span></p>
<h2>Embrace The Value Of Therapy</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healing from the effects of being dehumanized, gaslit, bullied, rejected, and threatened with violence takes its toll on even the strongest women. Making the decision to get support from a trained mental-health professional to help you through this rough time will be another indication of your wisdom, bravery, and commitment to centering your own needs after they’ve been on the back burner for so long. Therapy can take many forms — there is both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talkspace" target="_blank">online therapy </a>or brick-and-mortar — and last for as long as you feel it’s beneficial, and many therapists even specialize in divorce as well as healing from abuse. Shop around for a good match, and let the catharsis and empowerment begin.</span></p>
<h2>Focus On You</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know the idea of focusing on yourself sounds </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bananas</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You, with a kid or two tugging at your pant leg. You, with a full-time job, an ex or soon-to-be ex determined to make your life hell, and a sink full of dishes. I get it — it’s hard for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">me</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to focus on me, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of us recovering from the toxic effects of sociopathy, we throw around the term </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">self-care</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but we often forget to explain what it means. I like to think of it as doing good by myself — treating myself kindly, as though I am my own child. If that means a chocolate bar in the bathtub after the kids have gone to bed, do it. If that means Monday-afternoon yoga class while the kids are at school, sign up. Knit a hat, write a story, go for a run, or scribble in an adult coloring book. It’s time for you to be your own best friend, advocate, and partner, all of which was denied to you for so long but which you so richly deserve.</span></p>

<p>I feel like my marriage is strong for the most part. We love each other very much and respect one another. But there is a small problem (or at least what I perceive to be a problem). My husband spends most of his time on his phone. He’s constantly flipping through social media. I know he’s not doing anything wrong or dishonest on it; he will often sit right next to me and show me what he’s doing and who he’s speaking with!<span id="more-6701"></span></p>
<p>Even still, I can’t help but feel angry because he is choosing to spend his spare time on his phone instead of being present and enjoying time with me and our children. Even when we sit down to a meal, he will keep his phone on the table to check his Facebook page.</p>
<p>I know social media is part of everyday life, so I don&#8217;t know if I am over-reacting or have a right to feel this way. I don’t want this to drive us apart! Is this a real problem or do I need to do something to change my point of view?</p>
<p>&#8211; Sick of Social</p>
<p>____</p>
<p>Dear Sick of Social,</p>
<p>You’ve come to the right place, because our relationships with technology and how they affect socialization is one of my favorite topics!</p>
<p>Let’s clear one thing up from the start: You have a “right” to feel however you feel. That is not in question. And not speaking up about how you feel will drive you apart far more than speaking up (in a loving, positive way — more on that in a minute). Plus, studies show that couples who don’t ever openly disagree or constructively argue are at greater risk for divorce than those who do — so let’s not just sweep this under the marital rug.</p>
<p>So, technology. It may come as no surprise that it’s addictive. The pings we receive via “likes,” follows, and other social media-related notifications activate the pleasure center in our brain — so, yes, social media operates like a drug. Once you look at it that way, it becomes a bit easier to understand how challenging it can be to actively prioritize the people we love over someone like — oh, let’s call him Richard: a guy you went to grade school with but never really talked to and haven’t seen for 30 years, but who always seems to comment on your Facebook posts. You don’t REALLY care about Richard, and he isn’t personally a threat to your marriage, and yet, there he is, making his way to your dinner table.</p>
<p>So then why does it feel so invasive and threatening when Richard shows up uninvited? And why is it so hard to ignore him?</p>
<p>Because we have shifted our priorities: we now value virtual communication over in-person connection. We feel especially flattered when those exchanges happen publicly on social media — a performance of connection and social affirmation. Regardless of strength of ties, digital pixels often win our attention over the 3D bodies in our presence. It’s a problem — and your relationship isn’t the first (or the last) to suffer as a result.</p>
<p>So how do you combat the tug-of-war between technology and being present? Rules. I know, no one likes rules, and it’s no more fun to follow them than it is to suggest them, but technology, and social media in particular, are too seductive for some people to use without rules — at least not without their relationships eroding.</p>
<p>I’m not suggesting you be some kind of strict social media police, but if your relationship is as loving and respectful as you say, then your husband should be open and receptive to a conversation about how you feel when he prioritizes “Richard” over you. Open the dialogue by affirming what you’ve already acknowledged: that you’re generally happy in your marriage and know he respects and loves you. It’s precisely because you enjoy each other so much that you want to be conscious about being fully present with each other when you’re together, lest that bond start to crumble.</p>
<p>No technology at meals is an easy place to start and is a rule few would argue with. Outside of the dinner table, go beyond rule enforcement and consider suggesting some conjugal activities that leave little room for scrolling Facebook: hikes, movies, even playing a video game together — whatever it is you enjoy as a couple, start doing it together regularly (and suggest turning your phones on “do not disturb” or airplane mode during that time).</p>
<p>Not only will this strategy strengthen your relationship, it will also keep your children from feeling like they’re competing with an army of virtual “Richards” for their parents’ attention. Being truly present via ritualized unplugging is one of the greatest gifts you can give your loved ones in the age of technology.</p>
<p>Good luck with the digital detox!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Talkspace is pleased to introduce Ask Anna, a new Question &amp; Answer column featuring Anna Akbari, sociologist and author of “Startup Your Life: Hustle and Hack Your Way To Happiness.” Send your mental health questions for Anna to <a href="mailto:talk@talkspace.com" target="_blank">talk@talkspace.com</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hi Anna,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how this is going to work or if you are legit or not.</p>
<p>I would like to start off by saying that I have always been ambitious, always looking to conquer the world. However, I haven&#8217;t finished college yet due to some body and health issues. As of now, I&#8217;m not working because I recently gave birth to my son. But let&#8217;s get to the point.</p>
<p>My husband works overnight at a parking lot Tuesday through Sunday. He has his days off on Mondays and every Monday he goes out without telling me where he is and gets home the next day. He has been doing this ever since the baby was born seven months ago.</p>
<p>He claims that he isn&#8217;t doing anything wrong, but that&#8217;s just it. I feel strongly that not being home at night and coming home still drunk the next day is definitely not right. I don&#8217;t know what to do any more. I just want to end the marriage because of how unimportant and neglected I feel.<span id="more-6166"></span></p>
<p>I ask him over and over why he doesn&#8217;t want me to go out with him and he gives me excuses. Then he tells to my face all of my flaws and how I haven&#8217;t finished school. I understand that on his days off he wants to go out, but he goes overboard and it affects our family when he comes home so late.</p>
<p>What should I do? Should I end my marriage because of this? I tried talking to him over and over about this situation, but he doesn’t see it as a problem.</p>
<p>In need of advice&#8230;</p>
<p>____</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your question and for sharing your story. This is a challenging situation for any relationship, but particularly a marriage where there is a baby involved. I don’t envy you, but I definitely sympathize! And while there’s no magic pill to resolve this situation, let’s break it down and simplify it.</p>
<p>We all want and need relationships, but sometimes it’s easy to lose sight of why. Here are two important reminders about relationships:</p>
<ol>
<li>Human connection is vital to human happiness and flourishing, but only if it’s a healthy relationship</li>
<li>Relationships take work — even the good ones</li>
</ol>
<p>From what you’ve described, you recognize the value of relationships and are willing to put in the work, but your partner hasn’t fully bought into either of these key truths. You’re feeling angry and disrespected, which is a 100% legit feeling. But anger won’t help you or the situation. So what do you do?</p>
<p>For a successful relationship, it’s important to know and honor a) what you value and b) what your boundaries are. Let’s start there.</p>
<p>You’ve made it clear that you value transparency, responsibility, and support (or “having each other’s back”). Your partner is challenging each of those values with his behavior by not sharing his whereabouts — skirting both his parenting and spousal responsibilities — tearing you down when he could be supporting and encouraging you. Your frustration makes a lot of sense. I’m sure you feel like running — or screaming. Or both.</p>
<p>But let’s address the second part of that equation: your boundaries. You’ve asked your partner to discuss what’s bothering you (and remember: if one partner thinks there’s a problem, then there’s a problem) and he hasn’t been receptive. That doesn’t mean it’s time for you to compromise your values and acquiesce — that may pacify the situation for a while, but ultimately you’ll get fed-up and be unhappy, which isn’t beneficial for him, you, the relationship, or your son. Everyone loses in that scenario.</p>
<p>So what’s the answer?</p>
<p>Because there is a child involved, the stakes are higher. You are calculating not only what’s best for you, but for your son. Studies show that children who have a relationship with their fathers fare better (assuming they are not abusive). Dads matter! But, that does NOT mean that you must stay with him in a committed romantic relationship for your son to maintain a father/son relationship. You can’t be a good mother if you aren’t also taking care of yourself.</p>
<p>Take a moment and do some reflection. Be clear about your values — articulate them to yourself so you can clearly communicate them to your husband. And then let him know you are serious about addressing the disconnect between his behavior and your values. If he still isn’t receptive, you’ll want to determine when enough is enough. Once you’ve been clear about who you are and what you need, give yourself permission to set your boundaries and stick to them, even if that means splitting up. Sometimes our partners aren’t willing or capable to be the kind of partners we need, and it’s OK to step away. We can’t force someone to grow or change if they aren’t willing participants.</p>
<p>This is a challenging situation all around, but taking the time to identify and accept what you need and aren’t willing to compromise will create much-needed clarity and comfort as you move forward, regardless of the outcome. I’m pulling for you, whatever you decide to do!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a 25 year marriage, to the woman who I thought was the love of my life, I am now divorced and single. I know lots of men who say that divorce is the best thing that’s ever happened to them. For me that’s not the case.</p>
<p>While the idea of a 50% divorce rate has embedded itself in our imagination — it’s a difficult number to pin down, but it’s actually been declining since its height in 1980 — divorce remains a life-altering change that brings tremendous stress and anxiety. You’d think there’d be more support for those of us facing such a common experience. Unfortunately, that isn’t always the case. Statistically, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259167139_The_Influence_of_Divorce_on_Men's_Health" target="_blank">divorced men face a number of scary statistics</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher incidence of depression</li>
<li>250% higher mortality rate</li>
<li>39% higher suicide rate</li>
<li>10X more likely to undergo psychiatric care</li>
</ul>
<p>Divorce is still in many ways stigmatized in our society. As newlyweds we don’t imagine a marriage’s end, but even those of us whose marriage is in the process of breaking up don’t necessarily think of how to protect our mental health. There seem to be more resources for women, groups focused on providing emotional support and community. For us men, suffering in silence is the norm. We tough it out and power through. Or so we think.<span id="more-6274"></span></p>
<p>Divorce is actually even harder on men than we realize. Some of this unfairness may obviously be of our own making. We’re less likely to ask for help, reach out to our support network, or just to talk about our struggles. But this doesn’t mean we don’t face similar challenges to those faced by women. While two-thirds of divorces are initiated by women, we’re often blamed. We also face significant financial burdens after divorce and are less likely to receive custody of children. All of this without the emotional support systems available to women.</p>
<p>However, there’s a new tool that’s helping men like us work through these emotional challenges, reclaim our mental health, and live more fulfilled post-divorce lives.</p>
<h2>The #1 Tool for Divorced Men is Talkspace Online Therapy</h2>
<p>One of the reasons that we’re less likely to seek help after divorce involves the stigma surrounding mental illness. It’s time for that to change. When you go through the heartbreaking loss of family, stability, even friends from something as traumatic and acrimonious as divorce, there <em>will</em> be mental health repercussions. You will grieve. You will feel depressed. You might feel anxious, alone, or panicked.</p>
<p>Talkspace is online therapy for the way we live today — that is, for every kind of life. Even, and especially, when our lives change radically and suddenly from what we’ve known before.</p>
<h2>Talkspace is Affordable</h2>
<p>For many of us, a divorce represents a significant financial loss. The average cost of a divorce is $15,500, with those going to trial spending nearly $20,000. And that’s solely accounting for the cost of lawyers, not financial settlement. The average divorce also takes 10.7 months — a long time to be dealing with unsettled emotional turmoil. For those of us going through a divorce, a therapist’s bill would likely be the last thing that we’d look to add to our budget.</p>
<p>Luckily Talkspace is a fraction of the cost of brick-and-mortar therapy. When you go from being the breadwinner to eating bread over the sink for dinner, that’s something to be excited about.</p>

<h2>Talkspace is Convenient</h2>
<p>During and after divorce your schedule may be unpredictable. You might have alternating custody days or you may be commuting to pick up or see your children. There may be meetings with lawyers and court dates. You probably don’t need another weekly appointment to add to your schedule.</p>
<p>With Talkspace you’ll never miss an appointment because there aren’t appointments. You can message your therapist on your schedule, 24/7. Anxious over a meeting with lawyers or depressed over an unfavorable judgment? Just Message your therapist. Worried about the impact on your children? Message your therapist. Your therapist will get back to you twice a day with helpful tactics and strategies on navigating these uncharted emotional waters. There’s also the option for video chat, if you prefer a more personal interaction with your therapist.</p>
<h2>Talkspace Is Confidential</h2>
<p>For many of us the stigma of mental health issues already feels overwhelming. Add the increased scrutiny of our personal life during divorce proceedings to the mix and you can understand the hesitancy to announce mental health struggles to the world. Many of us worry about our mental health status being used against us in court.</p>
<p>Talkspace allows clients confidential access to therapy. You’ll never get caught unexpectedly in a parking lot or seen in a waiting room. You can even use a pseudonym with your therapist.</p>
<h2>Talkspace Is Going to Help</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.apa.org/about/policy/resolution-psychotherapy.aspx" target="_blank">Psychotherapy</a> has been shown to be effective by countless studies and Talkspace has worked with researchers from top universities to show that online therapy is as effective, and in certain cases <em>more</em> effective, than traditional therapy.</p>
<p>Divorce is hard. It impacts us more significantly than is acknowledged by our culture. Divorce might not have been your choice or your plan. But it doesn’t mean your life comes to a stop. It’s important to utilize the tools at our disposal to ease our suffering, help us live a happier, more productive lives, open to new possibilities for connection. Do it for a better relationship with your children and more fulfilling future romantic partnerships. Your Talkspace therapist will help get you back to on track and living the life you want. Talkspace is the #1 Tool for us men to emerge from divorce better than before.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a 25 year marriage, to the woman who I thought was the love of my life, I am now divorced and single. I know lots of men who say that divorce is the best thing that’s ever happened to them. For me that’s not the case.</p>
<p>My ex-wife left me for a man 20 years younger than me. That fact alone was alone was enough to send my mind down a deep, dark rabbit hole. Any ounce of self-confidence I had quickly flew out the window. No only did I go down a path of self-loathing and sadness, but I was crushed under a mountain of legal fees (no, she did not go quietly or kindly). I felt completely duped –– as though I couldn’t even trust my own gut anymore. Where had it come from? How could I have misjudged someone for a quarter century? What had I done to make her recoil in such hate?</p>
<p>Before the divorce I was financially stable. We’re not talking vacation home stable, but I was able to support our five person family –– which in today’s economy — is a dream, I know. Times have changed. My life certainly has. After the divorce, I am now struggling to pay rent for the two bedroom apartment I currently live in. That part is tough, but it’s nothing compared to the pain and devastation I feel about not being able to see my kids everyday. That keeps me up at night. That gives me a sinking feeling in my stomach. That aspect of this entire nightmare is what makes me want to give up on everything –– and yet, my kids are the only reason to keep going.<span id="more-6266"></span></p>
<p>For the first time in my life, I experienced a lasting depression. I’m human, I’ve been sad, but I’ve never had that feeling where I could just sleep for hours and hours on end, and still be exhausted. I lost interest in everything — friends, work, sports. I barely ate (which, for me, is a huge indicator that something is seriously wrong), the only windows of joy was when I could see my kids. But every time I had to bring those three little goofballs back, back to my own house with the stuff I’d accumulated over 25 years of sharing a life with someone, it was like losing them all over again.</p>
<p>One night I was actually so far down the rabbit hole that I googled “ways to help depression” and Talkspace came up. I have never been to therapy nor do I really know many people who have (openly at least). I never really thought I needed it. But I was desperate at this point and was ready for anything. I just wanted a little bit of relief. I needed someone to tell me it would be okay, that people did still love me, and to suggest some ways that I could be proactive about feeling better. I liked the idea that I could text a therapist confidentially and didn’t have to physically go anywhere. I also appreciated the cost –– especially after taking such a financial hit.</p>

<p>I got matched with a therapist who had dealt a lot with divorce. He understood the emotional trauma, specifically for guys. I liked being able to message him at anytime. Whenever the darkness hit, I opened the app and unloaded into this private chatroom. Each time it felt like I could breathe just a little bit more. I learned how to cope with my feelings rather than ignore them. I learned that ignoring them would sometime lead to a darker manifestation and they would linger and become more powerful. I never had a vocabulary for my emotions. In a way, I used to be so afraid of them. I didn’t really like feeling things when I could avoid it. Working with my Talkspace therapist, I learned how to feel my emotions and accept what I was feeling, but recognize that they did not have to consume me. My therapist became a flashlight to help guide me through an otherwise dark tunnel.</p>
<p>Once I started working through my heavy feelings, I was able to become a better father to my kids. I was able to be present and not consumed with sadness and anger. I was able to enjoy small moments with them. I was able to be the kind of role model I always wanted to be. I am still hurting, but today I feel hope –– and that’s something I have not felt in a long time.</p>
<p>I still return to those dark memories sometimes, the bad times, alone in that empty apartment. I had never felt so lonely and stuck, when it was impossible to connect with anyone. At least that’s what I imagined. I didn’t know there was someone available at the touch of a button, available 24/7. I’m so glad I found my therapist, someone I could reach out to any time. To have Talkspace there when the going gets bad, it’s a huge weight off of my shoulders. I’m becoming the person I didn’t even realize I should have been when I was married. Talkspace is helping me be the man I want to be for my kids — and for the person I’ll eventually meet and share my life with. I’m pretty excited about what comes next.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a 25 year marriage, to the woman who I thought was the love of my life, I am now divorced and single. I know lots of men who say that divorce is the best thing that’s ever happened to them. For me that’s not the case.</p>
<p>While the idea of a 50% divorce rate has embedded itself in our imagination — it’s a difficult number to pin down, but it’s actually been declining since its height in 1980 — divorce remains a life-altering change that brings tremendous stress and anxiety. You’d think there’d be more support for those of us facing such a common experience. Unfortunately, that isn’t always the case. Statistically, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259167139_The_Influence_of_Divorce_on_Men's_Health" target="_blank">divorced men face a number of scary statistics</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher incidence of depression</li>
<li>250% higher mortality rate</li>
<li>39% higher suicide rate</li>
<li>10X more likely to undergo psychiatric care</li>
</ul>
<p>Divorce is still in many ways stigmatized in our society. As newlyweds we don’t imagine a marriage’s end, but even those of us whose marriage is in the process of breaking up don’t necessarily think of how to protect our mental health. There seem to be more resources for women, groups focused on providing emotional support and community. For us men, suffering in silence is the norm. We tough it out and power through. Or so we think.<span id="more-6282"></span></p>
<p>Divorce is actually even harder on men than we realize. Some of this unfairness may obviously be of our own making. We’re less likely to ask for help, reach out to our support network, or just to talk about our struggles. But this doesn’t mean we don’t face similar challenges to those faced by women. While two-thirds of divorces are initiated by women, we’re often blamed. We also face significant financial burdens after divorce and are less likely to receive custody of children. All of this without the emotional support systems available to women.</p>
<p>However, there’s a new tool that’s helping men like us work through these emotional challenges, reclaim our mental health, and live more fulfilled post-divorce lives.</p>
<h2>The #1 Tool for Divorced Men is Online Therapy</h2>
<p>One of the reasons that we’re less likely to seek help after divorce involves the stigma surrounding mental illness. It’s time for that to change. When you go through the heartbreaking loss of family, stability, even friends from something as traumatic and acrimonious as divorce, there will be mental health repercussions. You will grieve. You will feel depressed. You might feel anxious, alone, or panicked.</p>
<p>Online therapy is the for the way we live today — that is, for every kind of life. Even, and especially, when our lives change radically and suddenly from what we’ve known before.</p>
<h2>Online Therapy is Affordable</h2>
<p>For many of us, a divorce represents a significant financial loss. The average cost of a divorce is $15,500, with those going to trial spending nearly $20,000. And that’s solely accounting for the cost of lawyers, not financial settlement. The average divorce also takes 10.7 months — a long time to be dealing with unsettled emotional turmoil. For those of us going through a divorce, a therapist’s bill would likely be the last thing that we’d look to add to our budget.</p>
<p>Luckily online therapy is a fraction of the cost of brick-and-mortar therapy. When you go from being the breadwinner to eating bread over the sink for dinner, that’s something to be excited about.</p>

<p><script>var gigz92y6w3qtole9,gigz92y6w3qtole9_poll=function(){var r=0;return function(n,l){clearInterval(r),r=setInterval(n,l)}}();!function(e,t,n){if(e.getElementById(n)){gigz92y6w3qtole9_poll(function(){if(window['om_loaded']){if(!gigz92y6w3qtole9){gigz92y6w3qtole9=new OptinMonsterApp();return gigz92y6w3qtole9.init({"u":"11288.519540","staging":0,"dev":0,"beta":0});}}},25);return;}var d=false,o=e.createElement(t);o.id=n,o.src="//a.optnmstr.com/app/js/api.min.js",o.async=true,o.onload=o.onreadystatechange=function(){if(!d){if(!this.readyState||this.readyState==="loaded"||this.readyState==="complete"){try{d=om_loaded=true;gigz92y6w3qtole9=new OptinMonsterApp();gigz92y6w3qtole9.init({"u":"11288.519540","staging":0,"dev":0,"beta":0});o.onload=o.onreadystatechange=null;}catch(t){}}}};(document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0]||document.documentElement).appendChild(o)}(document,"script","omapi-script");</script><!-- / OptinMonster --></p>
<h2>Online Therapy is Convenient</h2>
<p>During and after divorce your schedule may be unpredictable. You might have alternating custody days or you may be commuting to pick up or see your children. There may be meetings with lawyers and court dates. You probably don’t need another weekly appointment to add to your schedule.</p>
<p>With online therapy you’ll never miss an appointment because there aren’t appointments. You can message your therapist on your schedule, 24/7. Anxious over a meeting with lawyers or depressed over an unfavorable judgment? Just Message your therapist. Worried about the impact on your children? Message your therapist. Your therapist will get back to you twice a day with helpful tactics and strategies on navigating these uncharted emotional waters. There’s also the option for video chat, if you prefer a more personal interaction with your therapist.</p>
<h2>Online Therapy Is Confidential</h2>
<p>For many of us the stigma of mental health issues already feels overwhelming. Add the increased scrutiny of our personal life during divorce proceedings to the mix and you can understand the hesitancy to announce mental health struggles to the world. Many of us worry about our mental health status being used against us in court.</p>
<p>Online therapy allows clients confidential access to therapy. You’ll never get caught unexpectedly in a parking lot or seen in a waiting room. You can even use a pseudonym with your therapist.</p>
<h2>Online Therapy Is Going to Help</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.apa.org/about/policy/resolution-psychotherapy.aspx" target="_blank">Psychotherapy</a> has been shown to be effective by countless studies and in certain cases more effective, than traditional therapy.</p>
<p>Divorce is hard. It impacts us more significantly than is acknowledged by our culture. Divorce might not have been your choice or your plan. But it doesn’t mean your life comes to a stop. It’s important to utilize the tools at our disposal to ease our suffering, help us live a happier, more productive lives, open to new possibilities for connection. Do it for a better relationship with your children and more fulfilling future romantic partnerships. Your online therapist will help get you back to on track and living the life you want. Online therapy is the #1 Tool for us to emerge from divorce better than before.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was going to have my dream wedding, marry my dream man, and live happily ever after. Unfortunately adult reality does not always align with childhood dreams. My own parents divorced when I was 11. I remember how difficult it was for me to understand that they didn’t love one another any more, that my love for them both wasn’t enough. I was powerless to bring them back together. Those feelings haunted me far into my teens.</p>
<p>In the US, <a href="https://singlemotherguide.com/single-mother-statistics/" target="_blank">83% of single parents are mothers</a>. For us single mothers, solo parenting can often be joyous, but it also brings tremendous stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>You’d think there’d be more support for such a common experience, but unfortunately, this isn’t always the case. Statistically, we face a number of scary statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than half live below the poverty line</li>
<li>28.7% face severe mental disability</li>
<li>Twice as high an incidence of anxiety disorders as single fathers</li>
</ul>
<p>Single parenthood is still in many ways stigmatized in our society. Not every single mother imagined parenting by herself, but even those of us who did, didn’t necessarily think of how to protect our mental health. While there are some resources for us, groups focused on providing emotional support and community, many still suffer in silence. Many are afraid to ask for help.</p>
<p>Though women are more likely to reach out to their support network, or just to talk about their struggles, we often face more difficult challenges than those of single fathers. Two-thirds of divorces are initiated by women, and we’re also more likely to be raising the children. That means increased responsibility and financial burden.<span id="more-6284"></span></p>
<p>Women deserve non-judgemental help when we’re struggling and overwhelmed. There’s a new tool that helps us work through emotional challenges, reclaim our mental health, and live more fulfilled lives with our children.</p>
<h2>The #1 Tool for Single Mom’s is Online Therapy</h2>
<p>One of the reasons that we don’t seek help is due to the stigma surrounding mental illness. It’s time for that to change. When you’re dealing with the chronic stresses of being the primary caregiver — making every parenting decision, facing self-doubt, and exhaustion — there will be mental health repercussions. You might cry. You might feel depressed. You might feel anxious, alone, or panicked. Your therapist will be there for you in those moments.</p>
<p>Online therapy is for the way we live today — that is, for every kind of life. Even, and especially, when our lives are complicated.</p>
<h2>Online Therapy is Affordable</h2>
<p>For many of us, parenting solo represents a significant financial burden. The <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-families.html" target="_blank">median income for single mothers</a> is $34,000, while the median income for married couples is $84,000. Only <a href="http://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/66-female-headed-families-receiving-child-support#detailed/1/any/false/869,36,868,867,133/any/366,367" target="_blank">about 1/3rd of us receive any child support</a> and the <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS22499.pdf" target="_blank">average amount of support</a> is a mere $430/month. For women going through a divorce, a therapist’s bill would likely be the last thing that we’d look to add to our budget.</p>
<p>Luckily online therapy is significantly less expensive than brick-and-mortar therapy. When you’re the sole provider, that’s something to be excited about.</p>

<h2>Online Therapy is Convenient</h2>
<p>As single mothers our schedules may be tight and unpredictable. Between working to provide for our children and getting kids to athletics or clubs, commuting further from home to make ends meet, dropping them off with their noncustodial parent, we don’t need another weekly appointment to add to our schedule.</p>
<p>With online therapy you’ll never miss an appointment because there aren’t appointments. You can message your therapist on your schedule, 24/7. Anxious over a child’s disciplinary issue at school or lonely after not getting enough adult social time? Just message your therapist. Worried about the impact of growing up in a single parent home on your children? Message your therapist. Your therapist will get back to you twice a day with helpful tactics and strategies on navigating these difficult emotional waters. There’s also the option for video chat, if you prefer a more personal interaction with your therapist.</p>
<h2>Online Therapy Is Confidential</h2>
<p>For many of us the stigma of mental health issues already feels overwhelming. Add the increased societal scrutiny and judgment of single mothers to the mix and you can understand the hesitancy to announce our mental health struggles to the world. Many of us worry about our mental health status being used against us.</p>
<p>Online therapy allows us confidential access to therapy. You’ll never get caught unexpectedly in a parking lot or in a waiting room. You can even use a pseudonym with your therapist.</p>
<h2>Online Therapy Is Going to Help</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.apa.org/about/policy/resolution-psychotherapy.aspx" target="_blank">Psychotherapy</a> has been shown to be effective by countless studies and in certain cases online therapy is more effective, than traditional therapy.</p>
<p>Single motherhood is sure to bring us moments of unspeakable joy, but it’s also hard. It impacts us more significantly than is acknowledged by our culture. But just because you run into difficulties doesn’t mean your life comes to a stop. It’s important to utilize the tools at our disposal to ease our suffering, help us live happier, more productive lives, lives open to new possibilities for connection. Do it to have a better relationship with your children and more fulfilling romantic partnerships. Your online therapist will help get you back to on track and living the life you want. Online therapy is the #1 tool for single mothers to be our best selves.</p>
