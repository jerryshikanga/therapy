				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Schizoid Personality Disorder (SPD) is a condition largely marked by a lack of desire to form interpersonal relationships. Personality disorders like SPD differ from other mental health conditions in that they are thought to be deeply ingrained in the structures of a person’s psyche. It is this nature that makes them difficult, but not impossible, to treat.</p>
<p>The American Psychiatric Association notes that those with personality disorders have, “a way of thinking, feeling and behaving that deviates from the expectations of the culture, causes distress or problems functioning, and lasts over time.” And it is precisely that disconnect from cultural expectations, and longevity, that make those living with personality disorders suffer disconnection from their peers, friends and family.</p>
<p><span id="more-9409"></span></p>
<h2>Diagnosis</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/08/the-different-types-of-therapists-and-counselors-the-complete-guide/" target="_blank">Diagnosis for a personality disorder</a> typically takes very sophisticated and detailed assessments and observations from a licensed mental health professional. As Schizoid Personality Disorder is relatively uncommon, it may be challenging to find someone who is acutely familiar with the condition, its diagnosis, and treatment.</p>
<p>Schizoid Personality Disorder comes from a cluster of disorders that include what is culturally thought of as “odd or eccentric behavior.” That is, someone living with SPD exhibits behaviors that fall out of the established cultural norms. As you might imagine, this can cause a lot of disruption in interpersonal relationships. However, more often than not, this is not a problem for those living with the condition.</p>
<p>For someone living with Schizoid Personality Disorder maintaining emotional ties to others can be very difficult. They may find that the closeness with other people is generally undesirable, smothering and may <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/relationships-how-to-avoid-relationship-bankruptcy/" target="_blank">avoid relationships with others</a>, even family members. Instead, they may focus largely on developing relationships with animals.</p>
<p>Symptoms of the condition often include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feeling little pleasure from activities</li>
<li>Affinity for solitude or solo activities</li>
<li>Disinterest in developing relationships with others</li>
<li>Desire to avoid intimacy and deep connections with others &amp; typically only tolerate relationships to immediate relatives</li>
<li>May seem generally cold or otherwise flat to others around them</li>
</ul>
<h2>An Example of Schizoid Personality Disorder</h2>
<p>John’s family has always thought of him as being different. When he was young he often distanced himself from others and found it difficult to make friends while in school. However, he was always moved by animals and often found deep connection with them. He often spent a lot of time alone in his thoughts.</p>
<p>As he grew up, John didn’t date as he had little to no interest in sex or maintaining close relationships with others. He found work that largely kept him isolated from others, working alone for long hours. Most often when he had to engage with others, people found him hard to read as he didn’t show his emotions through his tone of voice and facial expressions.</p>
<p>As you can see from this example, early on his life John demonstrated some unusual behavioral patterns about relationships to others and their value. Because of this, he now finds it difficult to make friends and sustain himself in traditional working environments that require regular interaction.</p>
<h2>A Path Forward</h2>
<p>As you can imagine, Schizoid Personality Disorder can be tough to live with, as we generally view ourselves as highly social creatures. Those who don’t invest in close relationships, like those with SPD, may find themselves further isolated or ridiculed due to their presentation.</p>
<p>While often underutilized, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/09/different-types-therapy-psychotherapy-best/" target="_blank">short term therapy may help those living with Schizoid Personality Disorder</a> learn social skills to engage better with their environments. Most often, support with maintaining work and managing housing are primary methods of intervention and care.</p>
<p>It requires a lot of patience to engage with a loved one if they have Schizoid Personality Disorder. It’s important to note that perception of their behavior and lack of desire for closeness may be perceived as cold and harsh, even if that’s not their intention.</p>
<p>If you suspect that someone you know may have the condition, it’s important to seek medical care. Additional follow up assessments with a psychiatrist who works closely with personality disorders may help you gain a diagnosis and a clearer path forward.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Katie Reed, <a href="https://www.amotherthing.com/">a blogger</a> and mom of four from Salt Lake City, spent many years living with “quiet” borderline personality disorder before getting a proper diagnosis. Before that, she was misdiagnosed repeatedly — with bipolar disorder, Asperger&#8217;s syndrome, and anxiety disorder — none of which ever felt “right.&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more-8894"></span></p>
<p>It was after her third suicide attempt in 2009 that she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD), a diagnosis that thankfully changed her life for the better.</p>
<p>“When I was finally diagnosed with BPD, it was like a light went on, and I suddenly understood what was going on in my brain and why I acted the way I did,” Reed tells <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/talkspace-online-therapy-licensed-ecounseling/id661829386?mt=8" target="_blank">Talkspace</a>.</p>
<h2>What is “Quiet” Borderline Personality Disorder, and How Does It Differ From Classic Borderline Personality Disorder?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/borderline-personality-disorder/index.shtml">The National Institute of Mental Health (NIH)</a> describes borderline personality disorder (referred to most often as BPD) as marked by erratic mood swings, poor self-image, impulsive behavior, extreme “black-and-white” thinking, self-harm, and an inability to maintain stable relationships. Episodes of heightened anger, depression, or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/when-does-normal-anxiety-become-a-mental-illness/" target="_blank">anxiety</a> are another hallmarks of the disorder. These episodes can last for a few hours to a few days.</p>
<p>While there is no known, clear cause for BPD, experts believe a combination of genetics, brain structure and function, as well as environmental and social issues come into play. Many therapists point to a history of childhood trauma or abuse as a root cause of the disorder.</p>
<p>“Quiet” BPD isn’t readily distinguished from &#8220;regular&#8221; BPD—at least not in an official sense (it does not have a special designation in the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> [<i>DSM</i>], for example). And yet, therapists and their patients often see a clear distinction between the “quieter” cases of BPD and its more traditional manifestations.</p>
<p>While “classic” BPD is characterized by episodes of violent outbursts, individuals with “quiet” BPD tend to direct this violence inward.</p>
<p>“[T]hose with ‘quiet’ borderline personality disorder act in,” says Dr. Gerard Lawson, President of the <a href="https://www.counseling.org/">American Counseling Association</a>. “There is less hostility and fewer aggressive outbursts, but there may still be isolation, and self-injurious behaviors or suicide attempts.”</p>
<p>People with “quiet” BPD will still experience the intense emotional roller-coaster than distinguishes the disorder, but will often be working harder to shut these emotions down, or push them aside. Very often, their sense of self is marked by shame or self-hatred.</p>
<p>“People with BPD often feel that their emotions are ‘wrong’ and spend a great deal of energy either pushing their feelings down or trying to justify [them],” explains Jessica Tappana, LCSW, therapist and owner of Aspire Counseling. “Whether you react by withdrawing (&#8220;quiet&#8221;) or acting out, the emotional desperation of BPD&#8230;can feel unbearable.”</p>
<h2>How is “Quiet” Personality Disorder Diagnosed?</h2>
<p>Reed has always experienced BPD as an “inward experience.” There was very little “acting out,” and much of her intense emotions resulted in intense periods of self-harm.</p>
<p>“My rage and sadness are usually internalized, and my frustrations are directed inward. My arms are criss-crossed with scars in various degrees of healing from years of self-harm (cutting),” Reed explains. “I also tend to deal with upset by cutting myself off from those I love, becoming robotic in my interactions, refusing to allow empathy or sympathy in. It has affected every relationship I’ve ever had.”</p>
<p>Because people with the with “quiet” form of BPD don’t exhibit the classic explosive symptoms of the disorder, it can take much longer to get a proper diagnosis, which is particularly troubling when the symptoms of the “quiet” disorder involve self-harm.</p>
<p>“I think people who have more internalized symptoms aren&#8217;t diagnosed at all,” says Dr. Colleen Cira, Licensed Clinical Psychologist and the Founder and Executive Director of <a href="http://ciracenter.org/">Cira Center for Behavioral Health</a>. “Borderline Personality Disorder has such a reputation in the psychological community as presenting as angry, manipulative, explosive.”</p>
<p>Dr. Cira explains that while there are symptoms of the “quiet” form of BPD listed in the <i>DSM</i>, they are often overlooked when evaluating a patient, making it more difficult for patients to get a proper diagnosis. “This is a real problem because not only do these people need treatment to address their BPD symptoms, they also likely has trauma histories and need treatment to address their trauma histories as well,” she says.</p>
<p>Patients who have not been properly diagnosed with “quiet” borderline personality disorder often end up feeling “invisible” and “misunderstood,” says Dr. Cira, which only makes the disorder harder to live with, and leads to more episodes of self-harm and lower self-esteem.</p>
<h2>Treatment (and Hope) For People With “Quiet” Borderline Personality Disorder</h2>
<p>Getting a proper diagnosis for a “quiet” version of BPD tends to be half the battle.  When patients find out the name for what they&#8217;ve been living with, it can be like a huge weight is lifted from their shoulders.</p>
<p>“I have felt far less crazy since getting my diagnosis because now I know what I am dealing with,” says Reed.</p>
<p>The good news is that treatment options for “quiet” BPD have increased over the years, as the disorder becomes better understood. Once patients get a diagnosis, there are several evidence-based treatments out there.</p>
<p>“Not so long ago (15-20 years) some very skilled clinicians believed there was no help for individuals who have a disorder like BPD,” says Dr. Lawson. “Now, there are actually very good treatment options, and they are improving.”</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-Conditions/Borderline-Personality-Disorder" target="_blank">National Alliance of Mental Health (NAMI)</a>, psychotherapy is the recommended treatment, with Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and Mentalization-Based Therapy (MBT) topping the list of treatment methodologies.</p>
<p>DBT is the therapy of choice for therapist Jessica Tappana, who has used it frequently to treat “quiet” borderline personality patients in her practice. It’s an intensive treatment with four components: individual therapy, group DBT skills training, coaching throughout the week, and weekly meetings with your consultation team. But its comprehensive nature is what makes it so successful, according to Tappana.</p>
<p>“DBT does more than treat the symptoms of quiet BPD, it teaches you a new way to interact with the world around you,” she says.</p>
<p>Whatever method you use to treat “quiet” BPD, it is important you find a therapist that you feel comfortable with. “Quiet” BPD is something many will struggle with on and off for the rest of their lives. But treatment can lessen the symptoms significantly, and decrease the number of “episodes” patients experience.</p>
<p>Since getting diagnosed and entering treatment, Reed says she has far fewer episodes “Thankfully, as I’ve gotten older, I’ve been able to manage my illness better,” Reed shares. “It used to be several times a week that I would have ‘episodes’ but nowadays it is far rarer — once a year or so at most.”</p>
<p>Most importantly, Reed is now able to recognize what is happening to her, and work through it with a little more compassion and self-love. Reed openly writes about her experiences with mental illness <a href="https://www.amotherthing.com/depression-suicide-love-and-redemption/" target="_blank">on her blog</a>, and considers herself an advocate for people with the disorder.</p>
<p>Reed’s hope for the future is that more people suffering with “quiet” BPD can get the treatment they need to live life to the fullest. “It&#8217;s a really important subject to share with people and help them understand,” she says.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Narcissism, or Narcissistic Personality Disorder, is almost as hard to deal with in the workplace as it is in <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/tips-co-parenting-narcissist/" target="_blank">family</a> or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/09/7-signs-partner-narcissist/" target="_blank">intimate relationships</a>. The most difficult situation is when your boss is a narcissist, because not only are you forced into close contact with your boss every day, but you are dependent on them for your income.</p>
<p>When your boss is unpredictable, self-centered, and easily upset, you might develop something akin to a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/ptsd/" target="_blank">PTSD</a> response when you go into work each day. You are terrified of being insulted, shamed in front of coworkers, overlooked for opportunities, or even fired. Fortunately, though, there are ways to deal with your narcissistic boss that may allow you to survive and even thrive at work.<span id="more-8628"></span></p>
<p>Note: I use the masculine pronoun in this piece, but obviously there are many female bosses who are narcissistic or have narcissistic personality disorder.</p>
<h2>1. Moderate Your Expectations</h2>
<p>Your boss might not care if you are sick and will not remember your wedding is in June. Nor will he be sorry for calling you at 9 p.m. on a Friday night. Don’t keep expecting him to have boundaries or reasonable demands. This strategy doesn’t mean you have to comply with irrational requests. If you recognize and accept that irrational requests will continue to be made, however, you’ll end up feeling less stressed and angry.</p>
<h2>2. Treat Your Boss How He Wants to Be Treated (Within Reason)</h2>
<p>This tactic doesn’t mean running to get him a cup of coffee every time he asks, but take careful note of how your boss represents himself to you and to others. If, for example, your boss considers himself a high-ranking guy, don’t suggest that a meeting be set up at Starbucks. Propose a high-end meeting place.</p>
<p>The more you pretend to see your boss for who he tries to be, the easier things will go for you. Be sure you don’t genuinely “drink the Kool Aid,” though. <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_BOTTOM&amp;utr_adgroup=bottom-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=8628" target="_blank">Rely on a therapist</a> or a friend as a sounding board to express your true feelings about your boss so you don’t begin to genuinely idealize him.</p>
<h2>3. Remember the Details of His Personal Life</h2>
<p>Most coworkers don’t expect you to know the names of their children, but a narcissistic boss will never forgive you if you don’t remember little Susie’s name — and that she is really into tennis. If your memory isn’t great, write some notes on a document so you can remember the details.</p>
<p><a href="https://courses.talkspace.com/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_MID&amp;utr_content=affordable&amp;utr_adgroup=midpost-cta&amp;WPpost_id=10823&amp;utr_baseurl=/www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/12/6-ways-to-deal-with-your-narcissistic-boss/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4880 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/e-course-blog-cta.png" alt="talkspace guide to overcoming stress at work CTA" width="660" height="240" /></a></p>
<h2>4. Accept Responsibility</h2>
<p>Don’t accuse your boss of failing to do something or of doing anything wrong. Rather than saying, “You didn’t tell me you wanted that presentation by today,” say, “I’m sorry, I thought it was due Tuesday.” Although you may think <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/04/talkspace-ceo-oren-frank-on-mental-health-care-innovation-curing-the-american-nightmare/" target="_blank">owning mistakes</a> will give your boss more ammunition to later criticize your performance, it is much better than coming off as defensive. Narcissists will rarely admit they are wrong, so do not try — explicitly or implicitly — to make your boss recognize his own error.</p>
<h2>5. Don’t Complain to Coworkers, Unless They Are Close Personal Friends</h2>
<p>Narcissists maintain power by being alternately very nice and very mean. The same coworker that grumbled to you about your boss’ narcissism on Monday may rat you out if the boss treats him to lunch on Tuesday. It may be tempting, but don’t gossip about your boss. Save your venting for friends, family, or a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a>.</p>
<h2>6. Look Up Alternate Jobs</h2>
<p>These <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/oren-frank" target="_blank">tips</a> may only help you for so long, depending on the level of toxicity in the situation. You don’t have to remain in the position you’re in, and going over your boss’ head to complain might have bad consequences. Certainly, if there is outright harassment or abuse going on, report it. But if your main issue is with your boss’ narcissistic personality, he isn’t going to change anytime soon. If you can’t or don’t want to deal with him long term, it is only logical to explore other potential opportunities in your job area.</p>
<p>Hopefully some of these points apply to your situation. Remember, your mantra needs to be: “Accept that your boss won’t change, and make your life as easy as you can.” Letting a narcissistic boss ruin your day — or your life — isn’t fair to you!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Co-parenting is never easy, but co-parenting with a narcissist is a whole different ballgame. <a href="https://esme.com/single-mom-voices/perspectives/my-ex-is-a-narcissist" target="_blank">Narcissists </a>are self-centered and incapable of putting anyone’s needs ahead of their own — including the needs of their own kids! Narcissists love chaos, drama, and control. Truly personality-disordered narcissists keep you off balance by forcing you to ride a roller coaster of abuse and seduction.</p>
<p>Here are four strategies that will help you build your strength and reduce stress:</p>
<h2>1. Manage Your Expectations</h2>
<p>A narcissist will not change, so it’s critical that you remember that the chaos and drama he creates is not about you. In the relationship, did he make you feel like you were walking on eggshells, always second-guessing, never good enough? Putting others off balance is a narcissist’s secret weapon, and he won’t give that up no matter what. Don’t expect him to step up, become empathetic, or give up his desire for emotional control. Managing your expectations will make things easier. Knowing that he won’t change establishes the groundwork for the next strategy.<span id="more-8338"></span></p>
<h2>2. Parallel Parenting</h2>
<p>True co-parenting is impossible with a narcissist, so instead aim for <em>parallel parenting</em>. What does this mean? In your house, your rules; in his house, his circus. Make yours a healthy, safe, and loving home to counter the emotional chaos that thrives in his house. Focus on qualities that are probably in short supply in his home: empathy, love, boundaries, and safety to express feelings.</p>
<h2>3. Stick to the Plan</h2>
<p>Make a parenting plan that both parents have to sign. If necessary, hire a lawyer to ensure the document has legal weight. To the extent that it’s possible, stick to that plan, even when he tries to disrupt it by shifting times, dates, and so on. Don’t waiver, don’t apologize; just stick to the plan. Narcissists will always try to exploit the situation to their benefit. Don’t feed the narcissist’s desire for chaos by engaging and becoming emotional. Let the small stuff roll off your back, and use email for the big stuff. Email reduces stress because there is no emotional tug of war that often happens on the phone. Not to mention, it’s all documented!</p>
<h2>4. Self-Care</h2>
<p>No matter how well you manage expectations, parallel parent, and stick to the plan, you’re bound to feel exhausted by your ex’s behavior. This is why self-care is essential. You have to build not only a healthy household, but also a healthy you! Make sure you sleep, eat well, build a tribe of support, and seek therapy to navigate the perils of co-parenting with a narcissist.</p>
<p>It can be horribly difficult to cope with an ex and co-parent who has serious personality issues. Nonetheless, you can still create healthy environments for your children by planning and managing stress. Once you learn how to deal with a <a href="https://esme.com/single-mom-voices/perspectives/what-i-now-know-two-years-after-divorcing-a-narcissist" target="_blank">narcissist</a>, the rest of your parenting duties will seem easy in comparison.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Narcissism, or Narcissistic Personality Disorder, has hit the mainstream. Although narcissism was always prevalent in about the same percentages of the population, the disorder is more widely discussed now than ever before. Because of the prevalence of discussions about narcissism in the political sphere — and its appearance in books and articles shared on social media — many clients wonder if their partner meets a criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder.</p>
<p><span id="more-6636"></span></p>
<p>Nobody can be diagnosed without being evaluated by a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-its-like-to-use-talkspace-text-therapy-app-2015-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">licensed therapist,</a> but there are some clues in your everyday life that your partner may, in fact, be a narcissist. I will use the male pronoun here, but narcissists can be any gender.</p>
<h2>He Is “Special”</h2>
<p>In every story your partner tells, he ends up being the special one. Whether his boss recognized his potential and singled him out for a promotion or the cashier who opened a second register at the grocery store waved him over first before the other customers on line, the point of every anecdote is that your partner is unique and better than other people, and that others recognize this quality in him.</p>
<h2>Anything He’s Involved In Is Also “Special”</h2>
<p>Some narcissists emphasize how wonderful and perfect their families are. At first it may sound like they are only being loving family members. Then you start to realize everyone in the family is put on a pedestal to keep your partner feeling like he comes from a special family.</p>
<p>Or maybe he idolizes his boss and thinks the company he works for is far superior to other, similar companies. In the beginning of your relationship he will likely also idealize YOU, because he would not want to date someone who is average. This will keep on happening unless you criticize him, in which case the relationship often ends or becomes highly conflictual.</p>
<h2>He Doesn’t Empathize Well</h2>
<p>Although people gravitate toward charming narcissists, they don’t often end up feeling very well understood by them on a deep level. You may be baffled by how little your partner understands even his closest friends. He will often misinterpret their motivations, behaviors, and emotions. Narcissists are really great with surface-level friendships, but truly empathizing with others’ perspectives often eludes them.</p>
<h2>He Seems Younger Than His Age</h2>
<p>Because narcissists can’t empathize with others easily, they often seem like teenagers even when they are middle-aged. Their emotional age and their chronological age don’t jibe, because their focus on themselves makes them appear less mature than their years.</p>
<p>Narcissists are often hyperfocused on their looks. This keeps them in shape and wearing trendy clothing, even when others their age tend to let themselves go a bit.</p>
<h2>He Is Best With Young Children and Pets, But Not Great With Older Kids or Teenagers</h2>
<p>Narcissists tend to like those who don’t talk back or have different opinions from themselves. A little sibling who idolizes them is perfect, and so is a dog who follows them around. As parents, however, and even as uncles/aunts or siblings, narcissists don’t do well when kids hit the age where they don’t blindly listen to whatever the narcissist says.</p>
<h2>He’s Very Generous, But Only in Ways That Indirectly Benefit Him</h2>
<p>For example, he may buy you a membership to a pricey gym…but you don’t really like working out and you know he wants you to be in better shape. Or he donates a lot to charity, but only at work as part of a fundraising drive where he knows he will impress his philanthropist boss.</p>
<p>Or he is sexually generous. But after each encounter, he prompts you to rhapsodize about his sexual prowess, and even wants you to mention it to your mutual friends. (In fact, here’s another <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/how-narcissists-act-in-bed-might-surprise-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post all about how narcissists act in bed</a>, and why they aren’t always as traditionally “selfish” as you’d imagine.)</p>
<h2>He Doesn’t Do What He Doesn’t Want to Do</h2>
<p>Examine your relationship carefully. Has your partner ever done anything that was entirely YOUR idea? As silly as this might sound, when partners of narcissists sit down to think about this, they often realize that — even in a decades-long marriage — their partner has literally done NOTHING he didn’t want to do, or at least nothing that wouldn’t bring him attention or adoration.</p>
<p>This realization is often a hard pill to swallow. It can lead the partners of narcissists to take a hard look at whether they want to remain in their relationships.</p>
<h2>What To Do If It Seems Like Your Partner Is a Narcissist</h2>
<p>If these points characterize your partner, a good first step is to do some more in depth reading about narcissists, like the books Emotional Vampires by Albert J. Bernstein and Disarming the Narcissist by Wendy Behary. If you conclude that your partner does in fact exhibit many of the signs of narcissism, then you should consider <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_BOTTOM&amp;utr_adgroup=bottom-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=6636" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussing this with a therapist</a>.</p>
<p>Often, if you’re drawn to narcissists, there are reasons for it in your own past. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/02/everything-you-need-to-know-about-couples-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Couples counseling</a> could be a good idea, based on whether you want to remain together. Either way, understanding your partner’s narcissistic tendencies is a great first step in understanding why you may have been feeling confused or dissatisfied in your relationship.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent years, there has been a huge uptick in awareness about narcissism and Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Many people notice flagrant examples of narcissism, like a coworker who talks endlessly about herself or a date who says most women tell him he’s the most attractive guy they’ve met on Tinder. But sometimes narcissism can be less obvious, and its signs may be counterintuitive.</p>
<p>This is the case particularly in the bedroom. Here’s a list of some sexual characteristics of narcissists. Some might not surprise you, but others could challenge your preconceived notions of narcissism.</p>
<p><span id="more-6229"></span></p>
<h2>Unexpected Generosity</h2>
<p>Narcissists may actually be very “generous.” You may envision a narcissist as a wham-bam-thank-you-ma’am type of lover who is only out to have his or her own orgasm and then rolls over and goes to sleep. Some people fit this description.</p>
<p>Others are much the opposite, though. Many narcissists pride themselves on being expert lovers who can give a partner multiple orgasms and the best experience of their lives. The only downside to this is that narcissists might expect their partners to rhapsodize over their lovemaking skill, and may even prompt partners to discuss this in awkward detail. Even providing oral <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/sex/" target="_blank">sex</a> for a partner is still all about the narcissist’s own ego.</p>
<h2>Super Specific Preferences</h2>
<p>Narcissists’ sexual preferences are often very specific. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/mental-health-in-bed-sex-and-depression/" target="_blank">In bed</a>, the narcissist may have very explicit ideas about what their partner should do or even say. They want the narrative to play out in a certain way, and they don’t have patience for changes to the script.</p>
<p>This has to do with their lack of empathy. Narcissists often don’t know or care that their partners don’t seem to be that interested in whatever scene they want to play out. This can lead to some strained encounters or even boredom on the partner’s end.</p>
<h2>Lying About Being Open to Anything</h2>
<p>Narcissists are often less “experimental” than they pretend to be. Many narcissists want to think of themselves as always in control and attractive. This doesn’t dovetail well with being game for a wide variety of creative acts. Some narcissists brag about how they are game for anything in bed, but they will not get into certain positions where they don’t look their best or they will not do things they think make them look silly.</p>
<p>By definition narcissists are highly <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/02/self-awareness-will-make-your-life-better-heres-how-to-get-it/" target="_blank">self-conscious</a>; they are only conscious of their own selves. In the bedroom this can stifle creativity and flow. There is truth to the cliché that narcissists enjoy looking in mirrors or taking pictures and videos of themselves during and as a prelude to sex. If you sleep with a narcissist, there is a higher chance you might be in one of those pictures.</p>
<h2>Unable to Handle Criticism</h2>
<p>Sometimes narcissists don’t learn from their mistakes. They may not even admit they make any. Other partners will likely show an increasing and evolving awareness of what partners like in bed. They will moderate their techniques if it don’t seem to feel good to their partners.</p>
<p>Narcissists, particularly if they’ve previously received positive feedback about their sexual performance, will often claim you must be wrong about your own sexual desires and responses. Narcissists might even tell partners they aren’t aware of how aroused they actually are, or that they like to complain, but their bodies are saying something different.</p>
<p>When narcissists happen to hit on what you like anyway, then everything is great. The first time you critique their technique, however, be prepared to be told you’re wrong. This can often get to a point where it feels like gaslighting, where you’re being made to feel like you must be crazy because the narcissist insists you do, or always did enjoy, something you never liked.</p>
<h2>Even If It’s Good, It’s Still Only About Them</h2>
<p>When you’re first in bed with a narcissist, you may have a great time or you may find the encounter boring and awkward, as with anyone else. The difference is that, in other relationships, you will likely both learn and grow together as a couple, and become more sexually compatible over time due to a greater understanding of one another’s preferences and tastes.</p>
<p>While dating a narcissist, you may feel increasing disconnection over time, both in the bedroom and out of it. If your partner is a narcissist, you will eventually recognize that — no matter how technically proficient he or she may be — the sex is not really about you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Psychopath. It’s a loaded word that immediately brings to mind many associated images. Serial killers and violent criminals tend to be the heart of people’s assumptions. Psychopaths dominate the villain role in media across all forms of entertainment and often take center stage in news broadcasts. Nothing about the word, or the psychopathic person, is good. They are fundamentally evil and should be treated as such.</p>
<p>In many people’s minds this is a belief carved in stone. This is unfortunate because it is mythology at its worst. Psychopathy, a terrible word on its face, is a widely misunderstood and demonized condition due to many factors. The media of course has a large role in this, but the study of psychopaths is also done on prison populations. It seems like a very good place to do so, as the assumption is that psychopaths are unrepentant criminals.</p>
<p>However, the study of those in prison represents but a fraction of the psychopathic community at large. Most of us are among you, your friends, your neighbors, a person with the same basic abiding human nature as you. There is a brilliant quote by Armon J. Tamatea that I often repeat: “Psychopaths in many ways are the least and most visible members of our communities.” We are defined by the worst of us, because the rest of us stay hidden from sight. This is because we are not like those inhabiting the world around us. In fact, we are very different.<span id="more-6216"></span></p>
<p>Our difference is obvious to us as children. The world operates on a construct of emotion that we lack. I have often called emotions the temperamental cheat codes to the neurotypical experience. It cuts out a great deal of the weighing information and deciding on actions based on the social outcome. Most people act as their internal directional emotions tell them too, and it makes human interaction much easier; everyone is on the same page.</p>
<p>We aren’t. <a href="http://www.med.wisc.edu/news-events/psychopaths-brains-show-differences-in-structure-and-function/32979" target="_blank">Psychopathy is a variant structure of the brain</a> that won’t be evident until after the person reaches twenty-five, and at that time, provided the circumstances are present to allow for it, they can be diagnosed as psychopathic. We lack empathy, we lack fear, sadness, anxiety, remorse, we lack many of the things that explain to you in silent code how to behave around others of your kind, and the world in general.</p>
<p>Instead we have to either be taught, or figure it out on our own. Nothing neurotypicals do makes sense to us. It’s like trying to figure out a foreign film without subtitles and no scene context. We just begin to mimic. As we get older, our skill increases and we do better, but in the beginning we are bad at it. Another issue we face is having to learn the value that neurotypicals place on certain behaviors that to us seem worthless. We must develop cognitive empathy, and use this to guide our interactions.</p>
<p>During this process, how we are guided makes a great deal of difference in how we will turn out, but it will never change the course that the development of our brains will take. We will lack what we are going to lack, and the best that can be done is directing our understanding of the world and how certain behaviors in it benefit us more than the alternative.</p>
<p>We are reward-driven and punishment-resistant. Tell us no, and we will likely take that as a challenge. Distract us with something more appealing, and you have our attention.</p>
<p>As we age, the differences between us and those around us dictate that we craft a mask that allows us to seem like everyone else. Neurotypicals develop social masks, a presentation of self that presents the best light possible. Psychopathic masks are far more involved and detailed. These masks are a different person entirely, and the more honed the mask, the more obvious it to us that we are very different than those around us. However, most of us will never think for a moment that we are psychopathic. We are no more immune to the myths about the condition than the rest of the world. We don’t identify with the stories that are associated with that word, and most of us will never understand that this is what makes us different than the others.</p>
<p>Growing up had its ups and downs, and I certainly was no angel. Psychopathy is a roller coaster that must be learned so you can round the curves without going off the track. It takes time, and it was no different in my case. As time went on, the disparity between myself and my peers was something that could not be ignored.</p>
<p>Where people formed groups, I never cared to belong. When others sought each other out in times of trouble, I saw no need. Problems in the family, which at times were plentiful, simply never fazed me or made an impact on me in any way. This alarmed my parents enough that they assumed I was dangerously suppressing things. I was promptly sent to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a> to be assessed. This was one of many times I was sent for therapeutic assessment, either due to others’ concern about my indifference, or when I managed to get myself in trouble while being entirely unrepentant save for the necessity of appeasing those in charge.</p>
<p>This difference in attachment, need, consideration, emotional necessity was more tangible as time went on. I decided to finally find out what the difference between us was. It is where I first heard the word I now recognize as being a part of who I am: Psychopathy.</p>
<p>Myths take time to dissipate, but the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">clinician</a> who was delivering this news to me came prepared. He was able to describe the differences between what is believed about psychopathy and what psychopathy actually is. In a single moment the understanding settled in that psychopathy was the difference between me and the world. It made perfect sense, and in the typically psychopathic manner, I filed it away and went on with my day.</p>
<p>Psychopaths may lack in fundamental experiences most people share, but that means nothing about the person with it. How a person behaves, how they treat the world around them — that should determine their value. Not the way their brain was wired.</p>
<p>Psychopathy is rare, it is misunderstood, and those born with it are demonized for existing. It would be far better understood if the cloud of misinformation were lifted, and those who indeed are psychopathic could say as much without concern over <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/02/how-to-tell-if-someone-is-judging-you-defining-judgment/" target="_blank">judgment</a> or worse. There would be studies done on psychopathy in the real world, not limited to prisons, and the shroud of fear could finally be dispelled. Psychopaths are your friends, your neighbors, possibly your family. Being psychopathic does nothing to change that — and it can only change how you see them if you allow it to.</p>

Many of my clients, for example, have used these terms to describe their exes or people they don’t like. It’s often used in a pejorative sense.</p>
<p>But what does all of that really mean? The differences are more nuanced and complicated than you may think.</p>
<p>To understand these labels better, we need to first discuss what the basis is for understanding a person’s character or personality. A personality is a cluster of traits that makes up a person’s essence or “feel.” It’s how they interact with the world around them.<span id="more-6212"></span></p>
<p>There are many theories that <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-its-like-to-use-talkspace-text-therapy-app-2015-3" target="_blank">therapists</a> and the psychological community have created to understand the psychology of personality. The prevailing perspective on personality theory is called the “The Big Five,” otherwise known as the Five Factor Theory of Personality.</p>
<p>The Five Factor Theory of Personality is best known by the acronym OCEAN that stands for openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. The theory suggests all personalities primarily exist on a continuum in each of these areas. For example, you can be high on openness, which means you often seek out new experiences. Or you can be low on openness, which means you avoid new experiences or ideas most often.</p>
<p>How might narcissists, psychopaths, and sociopaths stack up on this kind of personality inventory?</p>
<p>Narcissists might score more highly on extraversion due to the gregarious nature of their personalities but could score lower on the scales for agreeableness or openness due to their often singular view of their world. Their neuroticism might be high because those living with Narcissistic Personality Disorder tend to be preoccupied with how others view or rate them.</p>
<p>But aren’t we all a bit narcissistic at times? Sure. Does that mean you have Narcissistic Personality Disorder? No.</p>
<p>Narcissistic traits cross over into Narcissistic Personality Disorder when they reach a certain threshold. When narcissistic traits cause disruptions in one&#8217;s daily life, like damaging relationships or leading to underperforming at work, then it may be NPD. The same logic can apply, to some extent, for the characteristics we commonly think of as being associated with psychopaths or sociopaths, such as high individualism, self-centeredness, lack of desire, and respect of rules and social norms, etc.</p>
<p>There are times in all our lives when we break those norms, but that doesn’t mean we are psychopaths or sociopaths. Being aggressive or self-serving isn’t a clinical diagnosis.</p>
<p>When a specific cluster of those traits reaches a certain threshold, then you might consider their personality to be psychopathic or sociopathic, or otherwise disordered. Those terms do not represent an actual diagnosis, though, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM].</p>
<p>Those who are sociopathic or psychopathic may fit more closely with the mental disorder categorized as <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder" target="_blank">Antisocial Personality Disorder</a> [APD]. This condition is most often characterized by low empathy and a general “pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others.” Generally this means that those living with APD demonstrate a failure to conform to expected social norms, laws and rules, generally lack remorse and may often be seen as being irresponsible, irritable, aggressive, and impulsive in their behaviors.</p>
<p>Sociopathy and psychopathy are often used interchangeably in clinical settings. Long ago, the cluster of traits that represent sociopathy and psychopathy were <a href="http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/antisocial-personality-disorder/psychopathy-and-antisocial-personality-disorder-case-diagnostic-confusion" target="_blank">combined and inform the diagnostic criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder</a>. There is still <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wicked-deeds/201401/how-tell-sociopath-psychopath" target="_blank">great controversy</a> in the field of personality of psychology on what the differences are between sociopathy and psychopathy. Due to the rarity of the conditions, it is difficult for researchers to find adequate and willing samples of people to participate to learn more.</p>
<p>If you consider the The Big Five in relation to someone who is highly sociopathic or psychopathic, you might imagine they would score in the low ranges on dimensions such as conscientiousness (reliable and self disciplined) and agreeableness (being modest and kind).</p>
<p>The reality is that only about <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/prevalence/antisocial-personality-disorder.shtml" target="_blank">1%</a> of the US population meets the criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder in a year. My clients’ exes probably do not fit the actual criteria. But that doesn’t mean they are any less culpable for their problematic behavior. In reality, we recognize that most of us inhabit these various traits on a continuum, as The Big Five suggests.</p>
<p>Maybe our exes have called us psychopaths. Who knows?</p>
<p>Using terms like “sociopath” or “psychopath” or “narcissist” as digs for someone who has caused us pain may not be entirely accurate objectively, and might be doing a great disservice to the people who do live with clinical conditions like Antisocial Personality Disorder or Narcissistic Personality Disorder.</p>
<p>There is still a lot to be learned about these traits and the select few who embody the truest clinical expressions of sociopathy, psychopathy, or narcissism. In the meantime, we can all serve ourselves better by looking at people in our lives and their behaviors to understand their impact on our lives.

<p><em>This piece is part of our <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/tag/darkest-day/" target="_blank">Darkest Day series</a>, a collection of stories from people who’ve made it through the worst of their illness and now light the way for others. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LightYourWay?src=hash" target="_blank">#LightYourWay</a></em></p>
<p>Am I a good person? It’s a question we all ask ourselves from time to time, but for people with Borderline Personality Disorder, it carries special significance.</p>
<p>As someone living with BPD, I’ve heard all sorts of negative comments about those dealing with the condition: we’re manipulative, angry, selfish, unable to empathize, incapable of maintaining long-term commitments — the list goes on. While it’s true that many people with BPD do exhibit some of these qualities at various times, they don’t describe all of us, at all times.</p>
<p>I’d love to say that I’ve never exhibited any of these qualities, but BPD, like most mental health disorders, exists on a sliding scale of severity. It’s a spectrum, one that changes depending on the amount of pressure being applied.</p>
<p>I’ve never been under as much pressure as I was in 2014. My second marriage fell apart in February (seemingly overnight, but was actually the result of many years of neglect and denial). In the weeks that followed, I enjoyed a tryst that ended horrendously (another story for another time). Then, on a rainy April afternoon, I found out I was pregnant with my fourth child (I’d spent the two years leading up to that moment on a waiting list to get my tubes tied).<span id="more-5772"></span></p>
<p>Everyone expected that I would get an abortion. Even my ex told me in no uncertain terms that having another child would “kill me.” The excruciating decision of whether or not to keep that child nearly tore me apart. I decided to keep her, only to find out when my pregnancy went public that everyone thought I’d cheated on my husband and gotten pregnant with someone else’s kid, and this was the reason our marriage fell apart.</p>
<p>Manipulative, angry, selfish, unable to empathize, incapable of maintaining long-term commitments—those are just some of the words I heard about myself that year. In fits of self-loathing, I even used them on myself a few times.</p>
<p>Such broad generalizations only perpetuate the stereotypes and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/stigma/" target="_blank">stigmas</a> attached to a complicated disorder. Even if someone with BPD does exhibit these traits, they need our support not our judgement.</p>
<p>Judgement. That’s the word that began my transformation from someone who was truly losing my mind into someone on the path to recovery.</p>
<p>We all pass judgements daily, most of the time without even realizing it. We judge the people around us, the situations we observe, even inanimate objects.</p>
<p>There is literally no end to the amount of judgements you can (and probably do) pass throughout your day, let alone throughout a lifetime. In <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/finding-inner-peace-mindfulness-5-senses/" target="_blank">mindfulness</a> training, you become aware of these judgements and learn to simply observe your surroundings without judging the people, objects, and situations within it.</p>
<p>For someone with BPD, judgement is an invisible cloud of constant negativity that can set off a chain reaction of overwhelming negative emotions. It can also aggravate co-occurring disorders like <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a> and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxiety</a>.</p>
<p>As I learned about my disorder and became more aware of myself, I discovered that I am constantly making judgements about my surroundings. It was important for me, therefore, to try to become a more positive, less judgmental person.</p>
<p>Now, whenever I think negatively about someone or something, I try to turn that negative into a positive. I take it even a step further, sometimes saying my positive thoughts out loud by giving someone a compliment. It doesn’t matter if they’re a complete stranger – everyone loves a sincere compliment.</p>
<p>It might not be precisely what mindfulness teaches, encouraging its practitioners to judge their surroundings as neither positive nor negative, but it’s a step in the right direction for me.</p>
<p>I used to think that my judgmental first instincts defined me as a <em>bad person</em>. I’ve come to learn that it merely defines me as <em>human</em>. I’ve learned that we are not defined by our thoughts or our disorders — we’re defined by our actions as individuals.</p>
<p>Yes, we all make mistakes. We all do things from time to time that others might judge negatively. But I am willing to emphatically state now that I am a good person. It took almost everything I had to ignore the judgements of others and take back control of my life.</p>
<p>No matter who you are or what your disorder, always remember that it takes true strength of character — real work — to turn a negative into a positive.</p>
