				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Video games provide a reprieve from our day-to-day life. We can escape into a fantastical, post-apocalyptic landscape in the <i>Fallout </i>series, or slay dragons and romance warriors in <i>Elder Scrolls: Skyrim</i>. After all, what&#8217;s wrong with a little make-believe?</p>
<p>Psychology researchers are trying to find out.</p>
<p><span id="more-11313"></span></p>
<h2>Research on Video Game Addiction</h2>
<p>Video game addiction may sound like a fake “boogie-man” dreamed up by parents in the &#8217;90s, but there is some scientific evidence to back up video game <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/addiction-mental-illness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">addiction</a> as a potential mental health risk — although not all research finds a consensus.</p>
<p>Psychology professors and researchers Patrick Markey and Christopher Ferguson <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/01/opinion/sunday/video-games-arent-addictive.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">found that</a> video games double the amount of dopamine in your brain…just like eating a slice of pizza. Delving deep into a virtual world seems to make you happy in the short-term.</p>
<p>But can the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/what-is-happiness-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happiness</a> sparked by binging seemingly endless, massively multiplayer online role playing (MMORPG) games like <i>World of Warcraft</i> lead to an addiction?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/01/opinion/sunday/video-games-arent-addictive.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">In the New York Times</a>, Markey and Ferguson argue no: the anxiety around the possibilities of &#8220;video game addiction&#8221; is nothing more than the fear of the new.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our children are &#8216;addicted&#8217; to new technologies because, for the most part, they improve our lives or are simply pleasurable,&#8221; they write, concluding, &#8220;Evidence for addiction to video games is virtually nonexistent.&#8221;</p>
<p>The American Psychiatric Association (APA) tentatively backs up their assessment. In 2016, they <a href="https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ajp.2016.16020224?journalCode=ajp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">undertook an extensive study</a> designed to determine if &#8220;internet gaming disorder&#8221; qualified as a potential psychiatric diagnosis.</p>
<p>While the disorder is mentioned in the DSM-5 (the current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), it&#8217;s listed as a &#8220;Condition for Further Study&#8221; — meaning this study may help determine if and how mental health providers treat internet gaming disorder.</p>
<p>Currently, the DSM-5&#8217;s diagnostic criteria requires meeting five of the following criteria within one year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preoccupation or obsession with Internet games.</li>
<li>Withdrawal symptoms when not playing Internet games.</li>
<li>A build-up of tolerance — more time needs to be spent playing the games.</li>
<li>The person has tried to stop or curb playing internet games, but has failed to do so.</li>
<li>The person has had a loss of interest in other life activities, such as hobbies.</li>
<li>A person has had continued overuse of Internet games even with the knowledge of how much they impact a person’s life.</li>
<li>The person lied to others about his or her Internet game usage.</li>
<li>The person uses internet games to relieve anxiety or guilt — it’s a way to escape.</li>
<li>The person has lost or put at risk an opportunity or relationship because of Internet games.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2016 study found that two out of three gamers reported no symptoms. In fact, less than 1% of participants <i>might</i> qualify for a <i>potential</i> acute diagnosis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Comparison to gambling disorder revealed that internet-based games may be significantly less addictive than gambling and similarly dysregulating as electronic games more generally,&#8221; the study concluded.</p>
<h3>Potential Positives to Video Game Enjoyment</h3>
<p>Some studies even indicate that video gaming might bulk up your brain. A study by neuroscientist Marc Palaus <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freedom-learn/201803/sense-and-nonsense-about-video-game-addiction" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">found that</a> video gaming boosts the volume of your right hippocampus and entorhinal cortex — both of which help spatial memory and navigation.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2017.00300/full" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">video games</a> may even be therapeutic: gamer communities provide peer support, and players with mental health concerns may find support and connectedness, which translates into real-world mental health.</p>
<h2>Increasing Concerns About Video Game Addiction</h2>
<p>But despite all these promising studies, there is some concern that video game addiction could become a serious problem. The World Health Organization <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/health/gaming-addiction-classified-as-mental-health-disorder-by-who-10443636" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">labels gaming addiction</a> a mental health disorder, estimating 2–3% of gamers are officially &#8220;addicted.&#8221; A 2010 study found gaming addiction significantly more prevalent in Taiwan and other Asian countries than in the U.S.</p>
<p>Tae Kyung Lee is a Korean <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/legendary-psychiatrist-became-supporter-text-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">psychiatrist</a> who runs a government-funded gamer treatment clinic. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5410811/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">He finds</a> that players can&#8217;t control how long they spend in the game — and when they stop playing, they experience virtual artifacts, like sounds and vision, in the real world. If you&#8217;ve played Tetris for more than an hour straight, you&#8217;ve probably experienced the same thing.</p>
<h2>If You Feel Like Your Gaming is Out of Control, Seek Help</h2>
<p>Is gaming addiction &#8220;real&#8221;? The answer depends on who you ask — but the research indicates most gamers don&#8217;t need to worry about a possible dependency. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with a weekend-long binge of new AAA blockbuster <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i>, as long as you&#8217;re fitting in your other needs, too.</p>
<p>But if your inability to put the controller down concerns you, reach out for help. A <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/08/the-different-types-of-therapists-and-counselors-the-complete-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">qualified mental health professional</a> can help you establish clear boundaries between you and the game.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the end of last summer, I had an existential crisis. I was about to turn 35, at a career crossroads, and on the verge of leaving the U.S. for good. I reflected back on how my adult years had been spent. They were self-serving, blurry and distant, and lacking deep personal connections with others. And myself.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d been living unhappily as a “man-child” — a lifestyle fueled by excessive partying and minimal commitment — for most of my adult life. Ashamed and disappointed I hadn’t accomplished more, I dwelled on squandered time and people I’d hurt along the way. I wanted to run from it all.</p>
<p>Rather than bouncing to Bangkok, however, I decided to clear my head. I was going to try an long-overdue experiment: a break from drinking. Half a year later, I’m still enjoying the positive benefits of that decision.</p>
<p><span id="more-9727"></span></p>
<h2>The Positives of a Drinking Break: a Conversation</h2>
<p>Since I’ve moved back to NYC, I’ll admit I’ve had a few social drinks. Lifetime sobriety wasn&#8217;t my endgame, but I wanted to see how far I could push it. I began to wonder if my taking a break was unique among the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/binge-drinking.htm" target="_blank">one in six US adults who binge drinks multiple times a month</a>.</p>
<p>In my first weeks at Talkspace, I learned that my content team co-conspirator, JoAnna Di Tullio, is on a similar break. I was interested to hear why she made the decision to take a drinking break, and what I could learn from her experience. Here&#8217;s our conversation&#8230;</p>
<h3>What was the moment or tipping point for the decision to take a break from drinking?</h3>
<p><b>JoAnna:</b> I think it was when I realized how much time I was spending drinking or recovering from a night out. I had been living in NYC for a little over a year at this point and I was having a conversation with my mom. She was asking me about what I had been doing for fun lately and if I was enjoying all that NYC had to offer (she’s in my hometown of LA). She asked me if I had been to the Highline, the Met, eaten Dim Sum in Chinatown&#8230; I hadn’t.</p>
<p>In fact, I hadn’t really been doing a whole lot other than touring the bar/party scene. I had been dating a guy who was a DJ so the party never really stopped. I realized that most of my “fun” adult-life experiences revolved around drinking, and that I wanted more out of life. And not for nothing, if I never suffered from another hangover again, I wouldn’t be mad.</p>
<p><b>Josh:</b> I feel you on the hangovers. They take me out the entirety of the following day. And don’t get me started on “hangxiety.”</p>
<p>To your point on enjoying NYC, I was in the camp that if I’m not buzzed on something, it’ll be boring. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/01/what-causes-social-anxiety/" target="_blank">It’s a social lubricant</a> for a social city. It think that plays into the larger decision to take more frequent breaks: realizing it&#8217;s ok to be your sober self.</p>
<p>My tipping point was one week that I went blackout three out of the five <i>weeknights</i>. I distinctly remember coming home after one night, looking in the mirror, and asking myself “Who are you?” That moment was a catalyst to leave a cushy job and get my mind right. I was hoping to re-discover myself before it was too late.</p>
<p>My most recent try at sobriety, which I opened with above, is related to being more present in relationships with others due to past mistakes in those arenas.</p>
<h3>The times you thought “I’m out of control”&#8230; was it a difficult conversation with yourself?</h3>
<p><b>JoAnna:</b> It’s always tough to look in the mirror and see the parts of yourself you’ve been trying to avoid. But I think this all ties back to just that –– avoidance. Drinking was a great way to distract myself from problems or questions that scared me.</p>
<p>But at a certain point that whisper became a roar and I had to get honest with myself: did I want to break out of old patterns and live a big life that I’m proud of? Or did I want to keep playing small because I was afraid of change?</p>
<p><b>Josh:</b> It’s <i>hard </i>to face yourself, and even harder to make a change. I think some people call it a “come to Jesus” moment. No matter your belief system, that moment is ultimately about not believing in yourself. If you don’t have <i>you</i>, what’s left?</p>
<p>I’ve been out of control at points, and the number of times I realized this and did nothing is staggering. I was a taker, and when I was drinking I could forget about relationship debts. I struggled with perfectionism, and scrutinized myself and my decisions to the point of paralysis. I needed to lose control to live, it seemed.</p>
<p>I’ve made progress on those fronts. Now it’s a matter of willpower and surrounding myself with more positive people and experiences.</p>
<h3>What keeps you focused on your health when tempted to head back out to the scene?</h3>
<p><b>JoAnna:</b> My health keeps me focused on my health! I feel so good these days. I’m still out and about. I go to bars with friends and dance the night away, but the difference is that the next day I wake up and can still have a full, productive day.</p>
<p>I’m an early riser and love the quiet of the mornings. I meditate. I write. I exercise. I wasn’t able to prioritize any of these things while in the throes of a hangover.</p>
<p><b>Josh:</b> From two desks away&#8230; you are honestly one of the healthier people I’ve met.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/5-ways-exercise-is-great-for-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">I’m in the gym 3-4 days a week now</a>. I meditate daily, if possible. Talkspace lets me balance work and life in an amazing way. I feel like I’ve hit the lottery, but have this lingering sadness, wishing I would have sought a clarity of mind sooner.</p>
<h3>How did your friends or family respond to this big change? Do you care either way?</h3>
<p><b>JoAnna:</b> I think some people were a little confused at first. But then it was no big deal. It’s funny, drinking is so ingrained in everything we do in our culture that at first, it’s hard to imagine what you <i>will</i> do if you’re <i>not</i> drinking.</p>
<p>The answer is, everything and more. It’s hard to imagine dinner without wine, or New Year’s Eve sans champagne, or a beach vacation without a tropical cocktail –– but once you do it, you realize that in a lot of ways, it can actually be a more enjoyable experience.</p>
<p><b>Josh:</b> Real talk regarding “drinking holidays.” It’s normalized to the point that there you get pushback from people if you <i>don’t</i> drink around occasions like NYE. I want that enjoyable experience you mentioned, and I want to feel the pain that comes with the less enjoyable experiences. That’s living, right?</p>
<p>It seems a lot of my relationships, and the people I surround myself with, like to party. I love my friends, and maybe I’m the bad friend for assuming we always have take the edge off somehow. I was nervous I’d get teased about it, but everyone was supportive.</p>
<p>My relationship with my immediate family has vastly improved. I’m more honest with them. I think my parents had similar discussions with themselves around my current age. They’re able to have a glass of wine or a margarita (or dos margaritas), and remain productive members of society. They set a good example.</p>
<h3>Have you had this discussion with your therapist?</h3>
<p><b>JoAnna:</b> Oh yes. I was going back and forth on it for a while. My therapist helped me realize that it’s something I could try for a little while and see how it goes. Guess what? The alcohol industry isn’t going anywhere.</p>
<p><b>Josh:</b> I’m actually restarting my therapy experience now using Talkspace. I haven’t had a therapist since I last lived in the city two years ago. I don’t think I was as up front about my “chemical romance” with my prior therapist as I should have been. Now I’m ready to openly discuss my problems without fear of judgement.</p>
<p>The difference in going it alone is that you don’t have that objective observer to help you with solutions. Trying to solve my own problems has been a minefield. I enjoy my time in therapy, it’s a completely positive experience.</p>
<h3>What are the major positives that have come out of this decision?</h3>
<p><b>JoAnna:</b> I think mostly how I feel. Not drinking has been amazing for managing anxiety. I also sleep better, have more energy, and overall am enjoying life more.</p>
<p>Another thing that’s come out of this is that my relationships have deepened in a way I would never have imagined. When you’re actually present and listening in a social setting… it’s revolutionary. I also feel a sense of empowerment and confidence that I didn’t have before. It’s all pretty wild to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Josh:</b> For me, it’s that <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/is-drinking-making-you-depressed/" target="_blank">I’m able to face my past, my problems, and myself</a>. It’s easily the most difficult thing I’ve done. It boils down to discipline, something I’ve been poor at historically. I’m proud I’m able to say no to things that do me harm, and yes to new experiences.</p>
<p>Another is the clarity of mind I thought I’d never experience. There’s always something brewing up there, but I’m better able to cope with, and talk through my issues. I feel less ashamed of who I am, and more hopeful for my future.</p>
<h3>What advice would you give to someone looking to take their own break?</h3>
<p><b>JoAnna:</b> It’s a deeply personal decision, so get honest with yourself. What are the reasons you want to do it? Trust yourself –– you know what’s best for you. And find your people. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/who-should-you-share-your-addiction-and-recovery-with/" target="_blank">Find the ones who support you, love you, and who are cheering for you</a>. The ones who are down to meet for tea and talk about stuff that matters. The ones who realize there’s more to life than the next party and being seen in the “right” places.</p>
<p>There might be people who give you a hard time about it –– they’re probably the ones who don’t deserve your energy. Another thing: get back to your roots. What were all the things you used to love to do but suddenly didn’t have time for anymore? For me it was reading, writing, and making art. What are all of the things you’ve wanted to do but didn’t have time for? Now’s the time.</p>
<p>But most of all, I’d say celebrate yourself. You’re going against the grain and doing something important for yourself. Be proud. Be fearless.</p>
<p><b>Josh:</b> Preach. Put yourself first, the rest will fall into place naturally. I started the journey trying to prove to someone else I could be the person they wanted me to be. I haven’t heard from that person since, nor do I expect I will again. It was a fool&#8217;s errand, but also the catalyst I needed to make actual changes. I realized I have many other people in my life who truly care about me and support my decisions.</p>
<p>One thing I’ll add is that it’s an amazing world out there, with nearly infinite experiences to be a part of. Because I was afraid to face life’s uncertainties, I missed out on some good years. I’m still working through how to enjoy things without a constant haze surrounding me.</p>
<h3>How can we continue to be supportive as friends, family, or co-workers?</h3>
<p><b>JoAnna:</b> By allowing people to make their own decisions judgement free. We don’t really know what’s going on with people, so coming at them with our opinions and advice, is sometimes not helpful.</p>
<p>Everyone has a right to do what’s best for themselves and we should all support one another in that pursuit.</p>
<p><b>Josh:</b> Like you said, support should be unconditional. The world would be a better place if we’d focus on being our best selves, rather than constantly expecting it of others.</p>
<p>That’s what I love about working at Talkspace: everyone is open and supportive. I know I’m pretty new to the team, but it feels familial. And not in that fake-y, startup-culture sense.</p>
<p>Thank you for being real, and having this conversation with me!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Drinking has a firm foot in our culture, and it seems to fit any occasion.</p>
<p>Having a birthday and turning 21, 30, or 50? Have a round on the house!</p>
<p>Getting married? Crank up Rihanna’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR0v0i63PQ4" target="_blank">Cheers (Drink to That)</a>” and throw one (or five) back while grooving on the dance floor into the wee hours of the morning.</p>
<p>Going on a first date? Why not meet at the bar for a classy cocktail or glass of wine?</p>
<p>Had a hard day at work, bad week, or even a rough month when you just can’t seem to shake that sinking feeling? Nothing a drink to lift the spirits can’t solve…</p>
<p>And that’s where we begin to run into trouble — self-medicating our depression through alcohol consumption.</p>
<p><span id="more-9686"></span></p>
<h2>The Relationship Between Alcohol and Depression</h2>
<p>Though a drink or two on occasion may not be cause for concern, the research is clear: drinking is making you depressed — and vice versa.</p>
<p>“The worst thing you can do if you&#8217;re depressed is to drink,” <a href="http://drhowardsamuels.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Howard Samuels</a>, CEO/founder of The Hills Treatment Center, tells Talkspace. “A lot of people are drinking because they&#8217;re depressed and then that makes their depression 10 times worse.”</p>
<p>Drinking for self-medication leads to a circular pattern where drinking causes the depression, which increases the need for self-medication, which means more drinking, and so on. This leads to dependency for many. The link between alcohol use disorder (ACU) and depression is very strong.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh26-2/90-98.htm" target="_blank">National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</a>, studies suggest that “30 percent to 50 percent of people with alcohol issues (at any given time) are also suffering from a major depressive disorder.” A similar <a href="https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh26-2/81-89.htm" target="_blank">study</a> found that those who are alcohol-dependent are nearly four times more likely to have suffered from depression in the previous year than those without drinking issues. In 2011, an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21382111" target="_blank"><i>Addiction </i>journal article</a> revealed that living with either alcoholism or depression doubled the chances of developing the other disorder.</p>
<p>Further, the <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/ria/news_events/es/es18.html" target="_blank">University of Buffalo’s Research Institute on Addictions</a> reports that those with ACU and depression generally experience more severe forms of both diagnoses, which are more difficult to treat. Women are more likely to develop depression first, then an alcohol problem, whereas men usually develop an alcohol dependency followed by depression. In addition, per <a href="https://psychcentral.com/lib/alcohol-and-depression/" target="_blank">Dr. Mark Jacob’s report for Psych Central</a>, “alcoholism may cause a relapse in patients with depression.”</p>
<h2>Alcohol’s Effects on the Brain</h2>
<p>To understand alcohol’s relationship with depression, let’s examine how alcohol affects our brain chemistry.</p>
<p>While it’s commonly referred to as a depressant, that’s not all alcohol does for us. When it enters the bloodstream and ultimately the brain, it increases both our feelings of pleasure and dampens our mood.</p>
<p>As blood alcohol content rises during the initial stages, drinking acts like a stimulant, making you feel better. This happens thanks to an increase in “feel good” neurotransmitters such as dopamine, triggering the brain’s “reward center.” Initially, alcohol can feel like an effective way to treat the blues.</p>
<p>However, as blood alcohol content decreases, more of its suppressive qualities start to take hold. Alcohol dampens excitatory neurotransmitters that regulate energy levels such as glutamate, taking things down a notch. Meanwhile, alcohol also reaches the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, which slows down the system, resulting in the “downer” feeling that can follow drinking.</p>
<p>“By jacking up dopamine levels in your brain, alcohol tricks you into thinking that it&#8217;s actually making you feel great — or maybe just better if you are drinking to get over something emotionally difficult,” writes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2012/10/16/what-alcohol-really-does-to-your-brain/#e4daacd664ea" target="_blank">David DiSalvo in <i>Forbes</i></a>. “The effect is that you keep drinking to get more dopamine release, but at the same time you&#8217;re altering other brain chemicals that are enhancing feelings of depression.”</p>
<h2>Dangers of Depression and Alcohol Abuse</h2>
<p>One of the other well-known side effects of alcohol is its ability to remove inhibitions — dancing wildly all night long or slipping between the sheets for a night of casual fun. We have reduced inhibitions because, according to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/you-illuminated/201006/your-brain-alcohol" target="_blank">Dr. Joshua Gowin</a> writing in <i>Psychology Today</i>, the prefrontal and temporal cortex areas of the brain experience a decrease in activity. The prefrontal cortex controls decision making and logical thinking. While under the influence, this area of the brain allows for less inhibited actions.</p>
<p>This loss of inhibition has a dark side when drinking while depressed. Research shows that those who consume “heavy” amounts of alcohol have a “five-fold higher risk of suicide than social drinkers,” according to a 2010 article in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2872355/" target="_blank"><i>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</i></a>. Further, the <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/suicide-prevention" target="_blank">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration</a> found that in 2008, almost one-third suicides across 16 reporting states involved alcohol.</p>
<p>Dr. Howard Samuels puts it frankly — the combination of depression and alcohol is much more likely to be lethal due to lowered inhibitions, increasing the risk of suicide. “It will make you feel better when you take that first shot of scotch,” he says, “and then you&#8217;ll drink more and more and more and…your depression will turn into <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/09/suicide-prevention-toolkit-ending-negative-cycle-addiction/" target="_blank">suicidal ideation</a> the next day.”</p>
<h2>Considering Proper Medication</h2>
<p>While some depression is situational — feeling down for a period of time after losing a loved one or being laid off from the job — for many, depression also has a chemical component best managed by medication. Drugs used to treat depression and other mental illnesses and alcohol also do not mix.</p>
<p>“If you drink, then you&#8217;re countering the effects of the antidepressant,” says Samuels. At that point, any benefits the meds may provide are nullified, and can even intensify the negative effects of alcohol use.</p>
<p>When alcohol is mixed with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a common class of drug used to treat mood disorders, the result can be a loss of coordination, motor skills, reaction time, and alertness, which makes ordinary tasks risky at best. Drinking while taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), another class of medication used to treat mental health conditions, can cause dangerously high blood pressure.</p>
<p>Benzodiazepines, often prescribed to reduce anxiety, target the same GABA neurotransmitter that alcohol does. This means drinking and taking these meds at the same time amplifies the sedative quality of both chemicals, which DiSalvo reports “can slow your heart rate and respiratory system down to dangerous levels.”</p>
<h2>Seeking Treatment</h2>
<p>Despite the alarming connection between drinking and depression, there is also good news. Jacob writes that depression symptoms are “greatly reduced” in about a month after letting alcohol go. Keep in mind depression may get worse before it gets better, especially while going through the withdrawal period of sobering up. Once you’ve stopped drinking, it’s easier to address the root causes of depression, whether a tough life situation or a chemical imbalance.</p>
<p>“Drinking and depression aren’t a good combo. If you’re having trouble with either or both, ask for help,” writes <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/hannah-sentenac/drinking-depression-and-t_b_5787796.html" target="_blank">Huffington Post blogger Hannah Sentenac</a>, who previously used drinking as a “socially acceptable method for feeling better.” “You’re not alone, trust me. These problems are much more prevalent than most people realize.”</p>
<p>In addition, awareness and advocacy about co-existing disorders, such as depression and ACU, increases daily. Programs that address both substance use and mental health conditions have become more widely available, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/who-should-you-share-your-addiction-and-recovery-with/" target="_blank">including therapy solutions</a>. Help is out there, and once you take the courageous step to reach out, there is also hope.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people drink socially and feel that their drinking habits are normal and healthy. There are other individuals who acknowledge that they are addicted to alcohol.</p>
<p>But in between these two categories is a subset of social drinkers who are secretly worried that their drinking behaviors may indicate alcohol abuse. These people may not share their concerns with family, friends, or significant others, but in the back of their minds, they are anxious that their drinking is out of hand.</p>
<p>If you’re always wondering <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/when-weekend-drinking-turns-into-a-problem/" target="_blank">what exactly distinguishes social drinking from alcohol abuse</a>, or if you worry about the drinking of a loved one, these seven points may help you figure out whether your drinking is something you may want to cut back on.</p>
<p><span id="more-9676"></span></p>
<h2>Alcohol Abuse Means&#8230;</h2>
<h3>Alcohol Interferes With Your Daily Life Activities</h3>
<p>Unlike what many people try to tell themselves, it is not “normal” to spend your entire weekend hungover. Even if you’re not throwing up, if you generally have a pounding headache and are unable to get to the gym or return a call from your mother on the day following a night of drinking, this means that alcohol is stopping you from living a healthy life. It doesn’t matter if this is “only” on Saturdays and Sundays; you don’t have to carry a flask with you to work in order to have a problem with alcohol.</p>
<h3>You Don’t Remember Many Things That Happen to You</h3>
<p>Again, no matter how people try to convince themselves, it is neither normal nor healthy to “black out” from drinking on a regular basis. Blacking out means that you recall events up until a certain time, after which your blood alcohol level was so high from continued drinking that your brain stopped recording memories. Blacking out is generally highly unusual for social drinkers; if this happens to you frequently then it may be time to re-evaluate your drinking.</p>
<h3>You Rely on Alcohol to Relax During Social and Sexual Situations</h3>
<p>If you can’t even imagine going to a party without being drunk, or if you can’t remember the last time you had sexual contact without being drunk, these are red flags. It means that you aren’t using alcohol to further enjoy a situation that you already are enjoying; instead, you cannot enjoy the situation at all without the use of alcohol to calm you or make you less inhibited.</p>
<p>Often, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/10-signs-social-anxiety-according-therapist/" target="_blank">people with social anxiety</a> or sexual issues (e.g., trauma due to a history of sexual abuse) use alcohol to mask these symptoms and allow them to appear “normal” to friends.</p>
<h3>You Often Do Things You’re Ashamed About</h3>
<p>Yes, everyone does embarrassing things sometimes. But if you’re usually scared to look at your phone or social media when you wake up after a night of drinking because you vaguely remember doing something extremely embarrassing, then this is a strong indicator that you are abusing alcohol.</p>
<p>While almost everyone does or says something embarrassing while drinking at some point in their lives, people who are moderate and healthy drinkers generally learn from these experiences and try not to get that drunk in the future. People who have alcohol problems continue to allow it to cause them deep shame and interpersonal conflicts week after week.</p>
<h3>Others are Worried About You</h3>
<p>If you abuse alcohol, the odds are excellent that someone — or many people — have noticed and commented on your drinking. Rather than dismissing their concern out of shame and avoidance, think deeply about their comments.</p>
<p>Does a best friend frequently say you <i>really shouldn’t</i> get that next drink? Does a significant other make excuses to not attend events with you where alcohol is present? Usually, alcohol abuse is much more obvious to others than it is to the person who has the problem.</p>
<h3>You Often Can’t Have Fun When Alcohol is Not Around</h3>
<p>If your best friend suggests going to the movies, do you make sure to have a glass of wine (or a few) at dinner beforehand? At brunch, are you the one who orders a pitcher of mimosas every time? When your significant other wants to stay in and watch Netflix, do you find yourself pushing to do a beer run beforehand so the night is less “boring”?</p>
<p>The inability to find fun in your life without the presence of alcohol is a key sign that your relationship with alcohol is less than healthy.</p>
<h3>You Can’t Trust Yourself Around Alcohol</h3>
<p>If you feel that you can’t stop yourself from having more drinks than you had originally planned, or that you can’t trust your behavior when alcohol is involved, then this is a hallmark of alcohol abuse. Some people can’t trust themselves to be faithful to their significant others when alcohol is involved. Others can’t trust themselves to get up and go to work the next day, or to get home at a time when going to work the next day would even be possible.</p>
<p>If this describes you, then it is unlikely that you are using alcohol in a moderate or healthy way.</p>
<h2>Seek Help if You Recognize These Behaviors</h2>
<p>If even one of these points resonates with you, it is a good time to take a step back and evaluate your drinking behavior. If all of the points describe you, then it is likely that you have a problem with drinking. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/09/history-future-addiction-treatment/" target="_blank">Don’t be too embarrassed to seek help from a therapist about your drinking</a>. You have the opportunity to nip your problem in the bud now, instead of ignoring it until it causes major problems in your life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my practice, I work with many young adults, and some older adults, who insist that they don’t have an alcohol problem despite binge drinking every weekend. There is a myth that in order to have a true issue with drinking, someone needs to drink alone, or in the morning, or every day.</p>
<p>It is true that for most people who are physically dependent on alcohol, drinking is far more frequent than on weekends. But there is a large group of individuals who drink so heavily on weekends that they certainly meet criteria for alcohol abuse, or problem drinking.</p>
<p><span id="more-9321"></span></p>
<h2><b>Binge Drinking Explained</b></h2>
<p>Binge drinking is defined as drinking more than 4 drinks for a woman, and 5 for a man (the differences in criteria are due to average body weight and metabolism). There are many individuals that drink far more than this, at least one night of every weekend. When people only learn to socialize when they are binge drinking, it can be almost impossible to socialize when sober.</p>
<p>There is a great book on this topic, <a href="http://www.korenzailckas.com/" target="_blank">Smashed by Koren Zailckas</a>. In this memoir, she describes how she would get drunk to socialize and to hook up with guys throughout all of college. Afterwards, when she quit drinking, she felt that she was stuck, emotionally, at a less mature age. She was stranded at the age that she had been before she started drinking.</p>
<p>When you drink in order to get along with people, you never learn how to interact with them in a sober, mature way. This is why many people feel awkward when trying to go on a date or meet new friends when they don’t feel buzzed, or outright drunk. Not to mention that <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/addiction-mental-illness/" target="_blank">drinking often masks depression, social anxiety, generalized anxiety, panic disorder, and more</a>.</p>
<h2><b>How Binge Drinking is Normalized </b></h2>
<p>Many college students feel that “everyone” binge drinks on the weekends. This is not the case, although research shows that a not-negligible <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/binge-drinking.htm" target="_blank">26% of 18-24 year olds binge drink</a>. Binge drinkers obviously spend their time with others who enjoy drinking, so their view on how many people really binge drink on weekends is necessarily distorted.</p>
<p>When people think “everyone” is doing something, or that drinking until you black out 2-3 times a weekend is a normal, socially condoned way to spend your time, then that can be used as a way to rationalize excessive, unhealthy drinking.</p>
<p>Most people know in their hearts when they are drinking excessively. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/lost-decade-story-addiction-recovery/" target="_blank">It takes a physical and emotional toll on them</a>. They may throw up, oversleep and miss work or classes, become belligerent and start fights with friends, strangers, or loved ones, and they may have run-ins with police.</p>
<p>They may not remember what they did over the course of the evening, which can sadly include things they would really want to recall, like their conversations or their sexual encounters with others. People can do or say things that they regret, and in the age of smartphones, they can drunk text embarrassing things that ruin relationships and make them feel humiliated. Unlike the drunk dials of a decade ago, drunk texts live on forever.</p>
<h2><b>Recognizing When Help is Needed</b></h2>
<p>Most people whose weekend drinking is out of control are ashamed of their behavior, and of feeling like they can’t get through weekend socializing without drinking to excess. There is nothing to be ashamed of. We live in a culture that makes jokes about binge drinking, but the reality is often not very funny at all.</p>
<p>If you recognize yourself or a loved one in this article, I encourage you to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/08/why-working-with-a-therapist-is-different-than-talking-to-a-friend/" target="_blank">reach out for help</a>. A therapist can help you figure out whether “just” drinking on the weekend is impacting your life negatively. You deserve to be living your best life, where you feel healthy and proud. The weekends are often 100% of your socializing time, and if you want authentic and genuine relationships with others, and to feel like your best self, figuring out how to drink moderately, or stop drinking entirely, is often a great place to start.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The holidays can herald challenges for everyone: awkward family issues, travel stress, gift expenses, religious conflicts. Those with mental illnesses might encounter triggers for various symptoms and issues. Addiction is no exception and can be especially burdensome.</p>
<p>During a time of excess and indulgence, it takes even more self-control for people in recovery to abstain from substances. Friends and family members might offer them a drink or invite them to smoke. There is a higher frequency of ads for alcohol. It seems the entire world is consuming without a care, yet those in recovery need to be more cautious than at any other time of year.<span id="more-8677"></span></p>
<p>These aspects of the holidays can be isolating for people with addiction problems. They often feel lonely and anxious regarding the increased chance of relapse, according to <a href="http://fromtheinsideoutproject.com/" target="_blank">therapist Laura MacLeod</a>, who has run several addiction support groups. If they do break their sobriety or promise to consume in moderation — even if it doesn’t lead to a full relapse — the resulting guilt can be devastating.</p>
<h2>Hiding the Addiction from Family Members</h2>
<p>Because of the fear of shame, judgment, or even excommunication, some people in recovery or with an active addiction hide their issue from family. This deception can be nearly impossible to maintain during the holidays. Relatives are in close quarters. It can be difficult to sneak away to attend a sobriety-related meeting. Diverting attention from the problem can be stressful and, ironically, lead to further abuse, psychologist Adi Jaffe, Ph.D. wrote in an <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-addiction/201012/addiction-during-the-holidays-recovered-or-not-its-important-be" target="_blank">article</a> for Psychology Today.</p>
<p>If some family members are aware of the addiction while others are not, the person with the issue may experience anxiety regarding being exposed. They might feel like they need to constantly do damage control and monitor what everyone is saying.</p>
<h2>Judgment from Those Who Know About the Addiction or Recovery</h2>
<p>If family members know about the addiction or recovery, they may talk about it inappropriately or make passive aggressive comments. The holidays are a time when people often air long withheld criticisms or grievances, often with the assistance of alcohol. These circumstances increase the chance of someone bringing up issues related to the addiction. The resulting shame can exacerbate substance abuse issues or feelings of isolation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some families expressly forbid their immediate members from discussing certain issues. This silencing tactic is usually an effort to contain the chatter and prevent other relatives from gossiping. If the strategy is successful, the person with the addiction might not need to worry about hiding anything.</p>
<p>The mandate of silence or secrecy, however, is not necessarily preferable. This attitude can be stigmatizing and make the person in recovery feel like they are an embarrassment to the family.</p>
<h2>Physical and Emotional Triggers</h2>
<p>Imagine a young man who is in recovery for an addiction to opioids. He returns home for the holidays and remembers he is staying in his old bedroom, the place where the addiction started. Every detail of the room fills him with shame and forces him to recall painful memories.</p>
<p>At the same time, he is tempted to use again. The nostalgia is seductive. There were some good times in that room. The familiarity with the environment might make him comfortable and facilitate a tantalizing high.</p>
<p>He manages to resist and head downstairs to the living room to hang out with this family. After an hour, however, his father begins behaving in a way that makes him ruminate on why he began abusing opioids in the first place. He feels trapped in a house designed to test his emotional endurance and self-control.</p>
<p>Many people in recovery have similar experiences during the holidays. The environment where they grew up can be very triggering and stressful.</p>
<h2>What People in Recovery Can Do to Prepare</h2>
<p>If you are recovering from an addiction, consider <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_BOTTOM&amp;utr_adgroup=bottom-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=8677" target="_blank">connecting with a therapist</a> and working on a mental health plan before the height of the holiday season. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/unlimited-messaging-therapy/" target="_blank">Texting therapy</a> can be especially helpful because clients can send a message the moment they feel triggered or distressed.</p>
<p>Remember to maintain your routines, even during travel and family visits. Stay in constant communication with sponsors or members of a recovery group. These people can offer guidance and remind you that you are not alone.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All of us have wasted money on items and services we don’t need, purchases we eventually realized were not worth the time or investment. Think about all the expired food you have had to throw out, tickets to movies that looked terrible, clothes you don’t wear (but the sale made them too tempting to pass up).</p>
<p>Sometimes the experience of shopping provides more pleasure than what we end up buying. Children feel joy simply walking through a Toys R’ Us. Going to Macy’s during the holidays is a tradition for many families. Later they realize they most likely spent way too much, but it’s OK. The New Year arrives, and expenses return to normal until the next holiday.</p>
<p>But what about people who treat every day like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, or Christmas? This kind of excessive shopping isn’t only financially irresponsible. The behavior can be a mental health issue.<span id="more-8447"></span></p>
<h2>The Evolution of Attitudes Regarding Shopping Addiction</h2>
<p>For decades people regarded compulsive buying only as a bad habit or personality flaw. The popular book-turned-movie, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Shopaholic-Sophie-Kinsella/dp/0440241413" target="_blank">Confessions of a Shopaholic</a>, portrayed the problem as millennial ennui, not a mental health condition. Other than the occasional daytime talk show special about a daughter who had mired her family in ridiculous debts, shopping addiction was more of a joke than a concern.</p>
<p>Today there are still many mental health professionals who do not think shopping — unlike alcohol and drugs — is a legitimate addiction. The American Psychiatric Association does not recognize shopping addiction, yet the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders does include gambling disorder and <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/apa-blog/2016/07/can-you-be-addicted-to-the-internet" target="_blank">considered adding gaming addiction disorder</a>.</p>
<p>Some people have referred to compulsive shopping as “retail therapy,” implying the act can have positive effects on mental health. The term exists primarily to minimize the seriousness of the issue. Shopping can provide temporary relief from stress and other negative emotions, but it is not a healthy coping strategy.</p>
<p>Like “hysteria,” “retail therapy” has a <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Retail%20Therapy" target="_blank">sexist connotation</a>. Men have used the phrase and similar language to imply women are prone to destructive behavior and cannot effectively cope with negative emotions. This attitude has contributed to delegitimizing shopping addiction.</p>
<p>Fortunately an increasing number of clinical associations and practitioners are treating shopping addiction as a mental illness. Several organizations, including <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology" target="_blank">Frontiers in Psychology</a>, have researched <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4908125/" target="_blank">compulsive buying behavior</a> and compared it with other behavioral addictions. The Official Journal of the World Psychiatric Association refers to shopping addiction as “compulsive buying disorder” and has amassed a wealth of research on the topic.</p>
<p><a href="http://fromtheinsideoutproject.com/" target="_blank">Therapist Laura MacLeod</a>, among other mental health professionals, has been using her practice to legitimize shopping addiction and provide a supportive community for people who live with compulsive buying disorder. Sufferers hesitate to call the illness an addiction, MacLeod said, yet the triggers, symptoms and effects are similar to substance dependency.</p>
<h2>Signs and Symptoms of Shopping Addiction/Compulsive Buying Disorder</h2>
<p>Here are some common symptoms therapists have used to diagnosis compulsive buying disorder:</p>
<ul>
<li>An inability to consistently abstain from shopping when buying items beyond a need or that don&#8217;t serve a purpose</li>
<li>An impairment in controlling the shopping despite reasonable efforts to stop</li>
<li>Shopping has caused significant impairment in functioning, including the ability to work, pay bills and living costs, maintain relationships, etc.</li>
<li>Consistent feelings of guilt or remorse about purchases</li>
<li>Feeling out of control while shopping</li>
<li>Relationship conflicts around excessive spending</li>
<li>Consistently using shopping as a method of modifying self-image and coping with negative emotions</li>
<li>A &#8220;craving&#8221; to shop as a means for reward or pleasure on a consistent basis</li>
<li>A dysfunctional emotional response that often presents as anxiety, sadness, or even anger if a person is not able to engage in shopping</li>
<li>Tension or anxiety before making a purchase, and a sense of relief after the purchase</li>
</ul>
<p>Like a substance, shopping can become a horrible vice that forces people to structure their lives around maladaptive behavior.</p>
<p>“Thoughts, perspectives, choices and behavior become one singular focus: to engage in the behavior of shopping,” said <a href="http://www.shemiahderrick.com/" target="_blank">therapist Shemiah Derrick</a>, who has treated clients for shopping addiction.</p>
<p>Compulsive buying behavior, much like drug abuse, has several stages, explained <a href="https://www.thecollaborativecounselingcenter.com/personnel/whitney-hawkins/" target="_blank">therapist Whitney Hawkins</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Stage 1: Anticipation</strong></p>
<p>The individual experiences obsessive thoughts and preoccupations. There might be a particular item or location they are fixated on.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 2: Preparation</strong></p>
<p>The individual plans for how they will make the purchase(s).</p>
<p><strong>Stage 3: Shopping</strong></p>
<p>This stage is the most exciting. The pleasure lies in the act of shopping, often more so than with the purchased items.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 4: Spending</strong></p>
<p>The individual completes the transactions and has a brief feeling of relief. Disappointment and guilt follow.</p>
<p>If this clinical criteria describes what you have experienced, consider <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_BOTTOM&amp;utr_adgroup=bottom-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=8447" target="_blank">connecting with a professional</a> to receive a formal diagnosis. Now that people are taking shopping addiction more seriously, there are many treatment providers and support groups. There is not yet a specific treatment model for compulsive buying disorder, but Hawkins recommended working with an addiction therapist. Shopping addiction affects <a href="https://ase.tufts.edu/gdae/CS/Compulsive%20Buying.pdf" target="_blank">millions</a> of people, so you are far from alone.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shame, guilt, desire, regret — these are only a few of the emotions people experience when they are dependent on a substance. This anguish has been fuel for thousands of beautiful, moving, raw and intense songs about addiction. For many decades artists have used their lyrics and melodies to tell stories of relationships with drugs and alcohol. Their songs have satisfied the curiosity of the sober and eased the loneliness of those who are struggling with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/addiction-mental-illness/" target="_blank">the mental illness</a>.</p>
<p>Rather than using subjective rankings to form our list, we thought about which songs most vividly describe the experience of addiction, how the illness can destroy lives and bonds. We looked for tracks that detail the mindset and behavior of someone who is falling into the void of substance abuse or realizing they have a problem (Keep in mind that recovery is the other side of the coin and deserves its own list).</p>
<p>Use our playlist to sympathize with those afflicted with addiction or remind yourself that millions of others carry the same burden. Here are our picks for songs about addiction (in no particular order):<span id="more-6934"></span></p>
<h2>1. “Not an Addict” by K’s Choice</h2>
<p>K’s Choice, a band from Belgium, was far from mainstream for a many years. “Not an Addict” played a crucial role in increasing their popularity and spreading their music to other countries.</p>
<p>The acclaimed song expresses the denial people often feel when the idea of “being an addict” enters their consciousness. The lyrics provide examples of what people tell themselves to avoid acknowledging a serious issue. As the verses carry on, the tone becomes more solemn and the character in the song verges on admitting there is an addiction.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2SsWOCoEw" target="_blank">Listen to it and watch the music video on YouTube</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kschoice/notanaddict.html" target="_blank">Read the lyrics</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>2. “Save Me” by Shinedown</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T8dyxGiBx3g" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>When people sink to the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/lost-decade-story-addiction-recovery/" target="_blank">deepest point in their addiction</a>, they sometimes cry out for help. They feel weak and powerless in the face of overwhelming desire for a substance.</p>
<p>“Save Me” expresses the pain of being consumed by addiction. Some of the lyrics and phrases describe the isolation and loneliness of losing everything to drugs, specifically pills.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8dyxGiBx3g" target="_blank">Listen to it and watch the music video on YouTube</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shinedown/saveme.html" target="_blank">Read the lyrics</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>3. “Semi-Charmed Life” by Third Eye Blind</h2>
<p>This rock song tells the story of a couple that is abusing drugs to spice up their relationship. The lyrics mention crystal meth specifically. There are also several stanzas with a theme of how people often rely on substances to make life more bearable, exciting, or pleasurable.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beINamVRGy4" target="_blank">Listen to it and watch the music video on YouTube</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>4. “The A Team” by Ed Sheeran</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UAWcs5H-qgQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Years before his rise to stardom, Ed Sheeran visited a homeless shelter and saw women who were addicted to crack cocaine, some of whom resorted to prostitution to fund their habit. The experience inspired him to write “The A Team,” a song that played a significant role in catalyzing his career.</p>
<p>Sheeran’s first hit describes the appearance, vibe, and behavior of a woman addicted to cocaine. He imagines what her story might have been: struggling to pay rent, feeling like what she really wants is unattainable, sinking into depression and desperation, using harsh substances to cope.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAWcs5H-qgQ" target="_blank">Listen to it and watch the music video on YouTube</a></li>
<li><a href="https://genius.com/Ed-sheeran-the-a-team-lyrics" target="_blank">Read the lyrics</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>5. “The Girl You Lost to Cocaine” by Sia</h2>
<p>Addiction can hurt others as much or more than the person with the problem. Relationships often deteriorate because one partner chooses drugs over love. When people date those with substance abuse problems, they often feel as if their partner is having an affair with the addiction. Sneaking around to hide drug use can feel like cheating.</p>
<p>In “The Girl You Lost to Cocaine,” Sia sings about the exasperation of supporting an addicted partner who does not improve. Most of the lyrics express her resolution to leave the relationship forever.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2>6. “Walk a Little Straighter” by Billy Currington</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U1no7Or9BeI" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Children of addicts grow up witnessing how substance abuse can cause neglect. “Walk a Little Straighter” tells the story of a boy whose alcoholic father constantly disappoints him. Eventually the boy becomes a man and resolves to be sober so his children will not suffer like he did.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2>7. “Heroin” by The Velvet Underground</h2>
<p>One of the “500 Greatest Songs of all time,” according to Rolling Stone, this hit describes the destructive nature of being addicted to heroin. The narrator believes the substance is powerful and addictive enough to “nullify” his life. It becomes his “wife” as well.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2>8. “The Needle and the Damage Done” by Neil Young</h2>
<p>As Neil Young grew older and furthered his career, he met many musicians who had become addicted to heroin. Some of these colleagues became close friends. When Young saw how the dangerous drug had destroyed their lives, he decided to write “The Needle and the Damage Done.”</p>
<p>Some lines in the song allude to how addiction can make people desperate. Young states that drugs often consume talented and hardworking people before they have a chance to become successful.</p>
<ul>

<h2>9. “Whiskey Lullaby” by Brad Paisley</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IZbN_nmxAGk" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Sometimes people turn to substances to cope with heartbreak. They hope the sensation of using will help them forget the pain of losing a loved one. “Whiskey Lullaby” tells the story of a man who became an alcoholic after his partner left and eventually drank himself to death. His tragic passing contributed to his ex developing an alcohol addiction as well. The country song illustrates how substance abuse can become a cycle. Addiction can be an inheritance.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZbN_nmxAGk" target="_blank">Listen to it and watch the music video on YouTube</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bradpaisley/whiskeylullaby.html" target="_blank">Read the lyrics</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>10. “Your Glass House” by Atmosphere</h2>
<p>People often realize they have substance abuse problems after partying too hard — yet again — and waking up with a horrible hangover and no recollection of the previous night. “Your Glass House” describes a woman regaining consciousness after a house party and feeling shame as she realizes her top is off and she has no idea what happened. She barely has enough mental awareness to call in sick to work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The fact that addiction, like other chronic diseases, can benefit from professional treatment isn’t something we’ve always known to be true. The roots of that understanding and its gradual evolution go back surprisingly far, however. While these do not follow a straight, linear progression, they offer some valuable lessons into what works best at improving recovery outcomes and where professional treatment is headed.</p>
<h2>History’s Understanding of Addiction</h2>
<p>The treatment legacy that today’s addiction professionals have inherited has helped to shed light on what works in improving recovery outcomes. For example, the concept of addiction as a disease — that alcoholism is an illness that can be medically treated — goes back quite a long way in our nation’s history.<span id="more-6717"></span></p>
<p>More than 200 years ago, one of America’s founding fathers, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1312212/" target="_blank">Dr. Benjamin Rush</a>, was writing about the mental and physical effects of alcohol and the dangers of heavy drinking. Dr. Rush was one of the first to provide a rough etiology (framework for causes) of the disease of alcoholism. By the mid to late 19th century, it was understood that “intemperance” was a disease that could either be “inherited” or “acquired.” It could even be curable “in the same sense other diseases are,” according to 19th-century bylaws for the American Association for the Study and Cure of Inebriety.</p>
<p>The 18th and 19th centuries also gave us the valuable contributions of mutual aid societies. The contemporary equivalent of these collaborations are 12-step groups like Alcoholics Anonymous [AA]. These programs have taught us that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3753023/" target="_blank">close peer and small-group relationships do lead to better recovery outcomes</a>. The more recent addiction research of Johann Hari — who authored the groundbreaking book, “<a href="http://chasingthescream.com/" target="_blank">Chasing the Scream</a>” — has further validated earlier lessons about the healing power of human connection in treating substance use disorders.</p>
<h2>Treatment Today</h2>
<p>Today we have a deep and profound appreciation for not only the complex biological and psychological dimensions of addiction, but the spiritual underpinnings as well. Spirituality can be defined as a sense of healthy connection with others, with oneself, and with a sense of purpose and passion greater than oneself (ie, a “Higher Power,” for example, in 12-step language).</p>
<p>A growing body of research has confirmed a link between spirituality (as defined above) and improved outcomes in recovery. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2693037/" target="_blank">study</a> of recovering heroin and cocaine addicts funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that the presence of a spiritual component in treatment correlated with higher rates of recovery. Another study found that a deeper sense of connection with one’s Higher Power correlated with higher rates of drug and alcohol abstinence in 12-step groups.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2755140/" target="_blank">Other research</a> is shedding light on the mental health benefits of spiritual practices such as meditation and mindfulness, with the result that these practices are enjoying greater recognition and application within the field of addiction treatment. Yoga, for instance, once the domain of Eastern spirituality, is today developing greater currency in more secularized and Western formats as an evidence-based treatment for addiction.</p>
<p>We’re also only now beginning to understand how spirituality can support recovery from trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder. These mental health issues are common features of addiction and substance abuse care must address them to be effective. In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3811127/" target="_blank">some surveys</a> of the substance abuse treatment population, as many as 70% of clients have reported experiencing some form of past trauma. Studies indicate that as much as 59% of young people with PTSD will subsequently develop substance abuse problems, according to the National Child Traumatic Stress Network.</p>
<p>This strong link between trauma, PTSD, and addiction is still a relatively new discovery and will likely herald more research. Once again, emerging findings suggest a critical role for spirituality in helping people with addiction recovery from these common co-occurring conditions.</p>
<h2>Takeaways for the Future</h2>
<p>We are learning that what works at improving recovery outcomes is comprehensive treatment that addresses the whole person and the complex and interwoven spiritual, psychological, and biological facets of their disease. Addiction is treatable in the same sense other diseases are, but only to the extent that we continue to treat it with a holistic and integrated approach, recognizing the multiple roots of substance abuse.</p>
<p>Medication-assisted treatments like Suboxone can be part of the answer to overcoming addiction, but they are part of a multi-pronged approach that must include other behavioral interventions. Improvements to this multidisciplinary approach and its methods of delivery is the main drive for professional addiction treatment today.</p>
<p>Such lessons from the world of substance abuse treatment are also a window into what it means to be human. A life that’s grounded in meaningful connections with others, with oneself, and with a purpose and passion greater than itself is, in many ways, “a good life.” Its pursuit is what makes us human — and its fulfillment, what makes us happy and healthy human beings. In this sense, what we’re learning in the world of professional drug and alcohol treatment has something to offer all of us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In honor of <a href="https://iasp.info/wspd2017/" target="_blank">World Suicide Prevention Day</a>, we wanted to provide useful resources for people who have struggled to see how valuable their lives are. Let&#8217;s help them remember they are not alone. </em></p>
<p>A life of addiction can lead to a lonely, isolated path. Pair that with the fact that more than <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1932152" target="_blank">50%</a> of suicides are directly related to drug and alcohol dependence, and the negative cycle of addiction becomes glaringly apparent. Whether people are addicted to drugs, prescription medication, or alcohol the first step is acknowledging that a problem is present.</p>
<p>If you are one of these people, do not make the mistake of thinking you are stuck and beyond repair. You can break free from your addiction or suicidal thoughts through the use of inpatient or outpatient treatment programs, a positive mindset, and a strong support system. Use this toolkit of helpful resources and tips to start along the path to recovery.<span id="more-6641"></span></p>
<h2>Helpful Resources</h2>
<p>You are not alone. There are several helpful resources with the sole purpose of helping you take your life back and break free from your negative thoughts. Here a few to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/" target="_blank">National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a></li>
<li><a href="https://afsp.org/" target="_blank">American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sprc.org/" target="_blank">Suicide Prevention Resource Center (SPRC)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/" target="_blank">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>Tips for a Successful Recovery</h2>
<p><strong>Seek Professional Help</strong></p>
<p>Although professional help may seem like the go-to route for those struggling with addiction and suicidal thoughts, <a href="http://americanaddictioncenters.org/rehab-guide/addiction-statistics/" target="_blank">less than 11%</a> of those addicted to drugs or alcohol receive care at a specialized addiction treatment facility. Likewise, those considering suicide often do not seek help.</p>
<p>The stable environment in an addiction treatment facility will keep you away from any temptations as you embark on your road to recovery. The help you will receive from the counselors at a rehab center is one of the best benefits provided.</p>
<p>These counselors are skilled and trained in the areas of addiction. It is their goal to get you on the right track to living a healthy, happy life. You will learn the proper tools and coping mechanisms that will help you overcome your past and realize you can most certainly live without drugs or alcohol.</p>
<p>If you want a cost-effective alternative to in-person addiction treatment, try <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/" target="_blank">online therapy</a>. It can also be a great first step for people who feel like their problems are not severe enough to warrant a stay in an addiction facility.</p>
<p><strong>Eliminate Your Triggers</strong></p>
<p>Relapse triggers are an event, person, or place that gives you justification to return to drug or alcohol abuse. When you are on the path of recovery, it is imperative to your success that you eliminate all triggers. Steer clear of old hangouts and company that condone addictive behaviors. Being around friends with whom you used to partake in illicit activities will only fuel cravings and lead to a relapse.</p>
<p>As you begin to eliminate old behaviors, be sure to fill their spots with new, <a href="https://www.summitbehavioralhealth.com/blog/4-positive-habits-replace-addictive-habits/" target="_blank">healthy alternatives</a>. Pick up a hobby, such as joining a community sports league. Or you can volunteer for a local charity, or even start taking a few classes to help you find a career you love.</p>
<p>Surround yourself with supportive people who will be there for you even on your hardest days. It will be helpful to have someone to turn to when you simply need to talk or get out for a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Create New Habits</strong></p>
<p>Substance abuse robs your body of its vitality, so in recovery it is important to get it back. Now is a good time to start <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/5-ways-exercise-is-great-for-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">exercising</a> and fueling your body with a healthy, nutrient-rich diet.</p>
<p>More than likely you did not have the best diet while you were using drugs or alcohol. After such an ordeal, your body may now be showing signs of a long period of malnutrition. Load your body with fresh vegetables, fruit, and lean meats. Be sure to take in plenty of water, too.</p>
<p>Once you become accustomed to filling up with healthy foods, you will begin to notice great changes in your overall health, immunity, and appearance. As you are on this quest to leading a healthy lifestyle, incorporate physical activity into your daily routine. Developing a regular exercise routine will improve your mood, energy levels, sense of well-being, and self confidence.</p>
<p>As you continue along this new path, don’t forget to incorporate <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/finding-inner-peace-mindfulness-5-senses/" target="_blank">daily relaxation techniques</a>, especially on those days when your thoughts leave you feeling hopeless. Create a <a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Brown_StanleySafetyPlanTemplate.pdf" target="_blank">suicide safety plan</a> to turn to when you can’t seem to break free of these overwhelming thoughts.</p>
