				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It would be nice if every relationship had a straight 50/50 power dynamic split&#8230;but those in relationships will tell you that’s probably not the case in their partnership. Relationships <i>should</i> be about a shared, equal bond, where partners are teammates who make compromises and share power, rather than a coach versus team member dynamic. Right?</p>
<p><span id="more-11461"></span></p>
<p>Think about this common question couples get asked: “So, who wears the pants in this relationship?” Usually, pop culture tells us the man in a heterosexual couple should “wear the pants.” If the woman “wears the pants” the man is looked at as “whipped” and sometimes even teased for it. By talking about and asking who’s <i>wearing the pants</i>, we’re perpetuating the idea that one person should be in charge.</p>
<p>It’s like society <i>demands </i>one person hold more power in the relationship. What happened to equality?</p>
<h2>Why Dominant Roles Exist in Relationships</h2>
<p>There are multiple reasons why one person may exert more power in a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relationship</a>.</p>
<p>“[Roles in relationships] depend on experiences in our lives,” Kimberly Leitch, LCSW-R and Talkspace therapist, says, “Someone may have been in a controlling relationship previously and now they tend to be in control of their present relationship in fear of repeating the same mistakes. The importance of balance varies with each person.”</p>
<p>Of course, there are other life events that can cause someone to be the controlling partner in a relationship — even events from <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/can-childhood-traumas-cause-panic-disorder/">childhood</a>. For example, if somebody had very controlling parents, it’s common that they too might desire control, even in a romantic relationship. Or, if someone experienced lots of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/11/why-rejection-hurts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejection</a> as they were growing up, they might take extreme measures in relationships to make sure they aren’t rejected or abandoned again.</p>
<h2>When it’s Okay to Defer to Your Partner</h2>
<p>In certain cases, taking ownership of the power dynamic is okay, if it’s in a healthy way, and makes sense for each partner.</p>
<p>“There are some personality types that like to relinquish the control onto their partner because they cannot handle the stress of the responsibilities or being in control elicits <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a>.” Leitch says. “I have a client whose husband works and therefore she is in charge of everything else [at home] and it works in their relationship. He also tends to be a passive person whereas she is a big personality and tends to be more assertive. He follows her lead and he doesn’t have to be bothered making decisions.”</p>
<p>In this case, the skewed power dynamic makes sense, so long as the passive partner continues to feel okay with the arrangement, and speaks up if they want more say in decisions around the house.</p>
<p>Even in situations like the one Leitch described, an imbalance of power can definitely turn unhealthy.</p>
<p>“It becomes an issue when you feel like you are not being heard and there is no sense of <i>you</i> in the relationship. It can lead you to feel uncomfortable and insecure.” Leitch explains, “You may feel like you are submitting to your partner’s likes or interests, which is not being reciprocated. It is important to communicate these feelings with your partner to avoid any negative feelings or behaviors.”</p>
<p>If you land in a place like this, where you feel like you don’t have a voice in your relationship, it’s definitely time to reevaluate your partnership and roles. Allowing an unhealthy power dynamic to persist can take a toll on even the strongest relationship.</p>
<h2>What to Do When You’ve Lost Control in a Relationship</h2>
<p>Here are some things you can do if you feel like your partner is being too controlling, or the power dynamic has shifted in an unfavorable way.</p>
<h3>Be introspective</h3>
<p>Look inside yourself and ask <i>why </i>you’re putting up with being bossed around. Do you feel worthy of healthy love? Are you scared of losing your partner? Are you feeling stuck because you’re scared your partner might physically hurt you if you try to leave? Are <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/how-to-recognize-emotional-abuse-in-intimate-relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controlling relationships</a> all you know?</p>
<p>Journal about your feelings, speak to a loved one, or bring it up in therapy.</p>
<h3>Communicate with your partner</h3>
<p>It’s possible your partner might not even realize how controlling they’re being. Speak up about your feelings, and explain the situation from your point of view in a non-confrontational manner. Spell out scenarios where your partner made you feel poorly about yourself or controlled.</p>
<p>Try to stay calm and level headed. As with any conflict in a relationship, communication is key. While it can be awkward to start a difficult conversation with a partner, learning to do so is crucial.</p>
<h3>Be confident and stand strong</h3>
<p>All too often, people lose themselves when they are in a controlling relationship. Stand your ground and try to take back some of your power in subtle ways by remaining <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/5-ways-improve-body-image-confidence-mental-health/">confident</a> and aware. It may also help to be more independent than usual, which helps you prove to yourself that you can be independent and take care of yourself. Keep your guard up so you can’t be so easily manipulated.</p>
<h3>Give couples therapy a try</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/couples-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Couples therapy</a> is great for couples who are struggling with any problem. A couple’s therapist can provide a safe space for each person to voice their concerns, and the therapist can help facilitate the conversation as well as help the couple understand each other. It can also help ease your nerves if you’re scared of confronting your partner one on one.</p>
<h3>Recognize signs of abuse</h3>
<p>Sadly, domestic abuse is common. Controlling behavior can sometimes be a sign or predictor of abusive behavior. Educate yourself on <a href="https://www.thehotline.org/is-this-abuse/abuse-defined/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the signs of domestic abuse</a> so you can be aware of what’s going on in your relationship and if things are on the road to getting dangerous.</p>
<p>If you believe you are being abused, tell a loved one and get in touch with an organization like <a href="https://www.thehotline.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The National Domestic Abuse Hotline</a> for help. This step also goes along with knowing when it’s time to walk away from the relationship and leave before it gets any worse.</p>
<h2>No Relationship is Perfect, but it Should Be Healthy</h2>
<p>While no relationship is perfect, and you shouldn’t necessarily strive for “perfect,” everybody deserves a safe, healthy relationship. A super controlling partner definitely does not equate to a healthy and happy relationship.</p>
<p>It’s okay to share duties and give up control of some areas or aspects of a relationship, but always be aware of your feelings, recognize controlling partners, and look out for the signs of abuse. Nobody deserves to feel powerless or unsafe in a relationship.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The night of my first <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/02/dating-someone-with-anxiety-what-you-need-to-know-and-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">date</a> with my ex, I felt strong, instant chemistry. The butterflies in my stomach felt more like large birds, and each kiss felt like 4th of July fireworks. Actually, even just looking at him made me feel fireworks!</p>
<p>We became official, and from there…it went downhill. Why? We were lacking consistency and things that came along with it, like trust. Once I wasn’t so blinded by chemistry, I realized we weren’t <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/is-your-relationship-over-5-questions-to-ask-before-calling-it-quits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compatible</a> and there were aspects of the relationship that were not healthy. When it came down to it, we wanted different things in life. There were parts of him I could not accept and parts of me that he could not accept.<span id="more-11447"></span></p>
<p>I learned it the hard way: Sparks are fun, but they’re not what makes a relationship last.</p>
<h2>The Difference Between Relationship Chemistry and Consistency</h2>
<p>This isn’t to say chemistry isn’t important in relationships — of course it is, particularly at the beginning! However, people who have experienced amazing, unbelievable chemistry (like me) can be the first to tell you that chemistry <i>does not</i> equal consistency, and it definitely doesn’t equal a long lasting and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/guide-setting-healthy-boundaries-relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy relationship</a>.</p>
<p>As with many things, the key is <i>balance. </i>Chemistry comes naturally and easily, and that’s part of what’s so great about it. Consistency, on the other hand, takes work and dedication to a partner.</p>
<h3>Relationship chemistry explained</h3>
<p>To better understand and break down chemistry versus consistency, I spoke to Cynthia Catchings, LCSW-S and Talkspace therapist.</p>
<p>“Chemistry is the initial feeling we have when we are attracted to someone. It has also been described as the biological effects of lust and attraction,” Catchings explains. “Experiencing these feelings can mean we feel we are on cloud nine and somewhat blind to reality. Although chemistry is a fantastic feeling, it is not the most important predictor of a good relationship. Basically, it is just a feeling that masks our significant other’s worst traits and lures us into putting up with them. Now, is chemistry fun and worth the ride? Absolutely, but only if we are aware that it is just part of a phase.”</p>
<p>You might be aware of this phase, often referred to as the <b><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/12/commitment-issues-reasons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">honeymoon phase</a></b>. During this time, fights are often minimal (or perhaps even non-existent) and it seems like our partner can do no wrong. Chemistry is peaking, butterflies are flying, and a lot of sex is probably being had.</p>
<p>Once the honeymoon phase is over, consistency is key. Any couple can probably make it through their honeymoon phase — it’s what comes next that’s harder and determines whether a relationship will last.</p>
<h3>The importance of consistency in a relationship</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/02/everything-you-need-to-know-about-couples-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Couples</a> will inevitably face hardship, have to make tough decisions, and run into <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/is-it-a-normal-fight-or-verbal-abuse-heres-how-to-tell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conflict</a>. And what’s going to get a couple through that? Consistency.</p>
<p>“Chemistry is necessary and good because it creates the desire and is part of the relationship game,” Catchings says, “However, consistency has to take over for that relationship to succeed.”</p>
<p>Feeling pure lust is a great feeling, and the honeymoon phase is super-fun, but we also must acknowledge the fact that chemistry alone isn’t going to establish an extra-solid foundation for a relationship. Certain relationship aspects, such as trust, don’t really bloom out of chemistry. They’re aspects that must be worked on consistently throughout the relationship.</p>
<p>“Consistency is a combination of behaviors that include dependability, trust, and a true desire to have a companion and form a serious relationship.” Catchings adds, “People who are more consistent with their interactions with one another, such as having predictable behaviors and good <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/07/dear-therapist-im-hearing-you-say-my-communication-skills-need-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">communication</a>, have longer and more successful relationships.”</p>
<h2>How to Start and Maintain a Successful Relationship</h2>
<p>Successful relationships will last once chemistry is no longer at its highest, and once partners have learned enough about each other and their flaws. In the long run, chemistry isn’t always as important as you might think it is.</p>
<p>“Think of a relationship as a cake,” Catchings suggests. “The chemistry is the frosting and the consistency is the bread. The frosting can be too sweet or melt, so it’s okay if it is not there. It just gives the cake a nice look and some sweetness.”</p>
<p>If you’re just starting out in a new relationship, encourage yourself to dig deeper than the chemistry and initial attraction. Learn about your partner, and allow your partner “inside” your world and your past so that they can learn about you, too.</p>
<p>It’s also great to be upfront about your desires and needs throughout the relationship. If you’ve already been together for a while and you’re missing the feeling of exciting chemistry, you can attempt to bring some <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/7-relationship-myths-debunked-by-a-therapist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">romance</a> and excitement back into your partnership by trying new activities together, experimenting with new things in bed, or going on a romantic getaway!</p>
<p>As Catchings puts it, “consistency is a more pure form of love that lets us know that we are in the right relationship.”</p>
<h2>Every Relationship is Different</h2>
<p>In the end, every relationship is different, and every couple will encounter their own set of problems. Each relationship will balance chemistry and consistency in different ways.</p>
<p>It may take a lot of work to find the right balance, or even to find the right partner to get the balance right, but when it comes to relationships, everything is a great learning experience.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you’ll end up with a delicious cake — topped just the right amount of perfectly sweet frosting.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some people keep feelings and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/control-emotions-cognitive-behavioral-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emotions</a> close to the vest. They aren&#8217;t bad people, but it can be frustrating when we’re only treated to occasional glimmers of their sparkling personality. Their slow message response times (leaving you “on read”) and unaccepted invitations make you feel unwanted, or that you&#8217;re the only person putting in any effort.</p>
<p>Having a heart-to-heart with a cheerful, friendly person, however, rarely feels like a struggle. But if everyone was cheerful and friendly, we&#8217;d already have world peace. Dealing with people who are distant seems to present a bigger challenge.<span id="more-11443"></span></p>
<p>Chances are they&#8217;re not <i>trying</i> to make you feel bad. And luckily, continuing the effort can reward you with a wonderful new friend, or a closer relationship with a familiar face.</p>
<p>Whether this distant person is part of a burgeoning relationship, a family member you&#8217;ve always admired, or a newly reclusive sibling or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/12/dating-someone-with-social-anxiety-6-tips-from-a-therapist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spouse</a>, here is how to show them you value their presence.</p>
<h2>Have Empathy</h2>
<p>A number of traits and mental illnesses lead to a distant personality. Insecure attachment styles, like reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social engagement disorder, can make people hesitant to start up conversations, seek comfort in the company of others, or ask for what they want directly.</p>
<p>However, just because someone is distant doesn&#8217;t mean they qualify for these disorders. In fact, the DSM says these behaviors must be present before <a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/915447-overview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">age five</a> to count as a &#8220;disorder.&#8221; <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anxiety</a> and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depression</a> can also easily manifest as distance. Pushing away loved ones is a common symptom of depression.</p>
<p>Even lesser stressors, like buying a home, going through finals, or helping a sick relative can lead a person to someone retreating and acting distant.</p>
<p>You may not know specifically what causes a person to distance themselves. They may not <i>want</i> you to know, and that&#8217;s okay. Don&#8217;t push for an explanation. But have empathy when reaching out: Refusing to easily share feelings doesn&#8217;t mean they’re rude or dislike you.</p>
<h2>Open Yourself Up</h2>
<p>Some distant people struggle to share their feelings. They may be embarrassed by their emotions, or scared of being vulnerable.</p>
<p>When dealing with a distant person, consider taking a few leaps of vulnerability yourself. Don&#8217;t reveal your whole life story — that can scare off even the friendliest stranger! — but show them that you&#8217;re not scared of serious conversation. By taking that first frightening step, you provide an opening for them, too.</p>
<h2>Give Them Time</h2>
<p>Demonstrating vulnerability is a fantastic way to engage a distant person. Just keep in mind: distance is not changed in one conversation. It may take time for your friend to fully open up.</p>
<p>For example, if a person is distant because <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/01/what-causes-social-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">socializing</a> increases their anxiety, they may only have the energy for one conversation per week. Consider their emotional resources like a battery: every interaction decreases the charge. Refueling time is mandatory, so texts may be slow or they may decline your next invitation out.</p>
<p>Relationship progress can be exciting, but don&#8217;t be disheartened when a distant person moves more slowly than you.</p>
<h2>Be Frank</h2>
<p>When you talk to your friend, make sure to used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-message" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><i>I-focused</i> language</a>: &#8220;I feel like you don&#8217;t respect me when you ignore my text messages&#8221; instead of &#8220;You are being disrespectful when you ignore my texts.&#8221; Accusations may make them <i>more</i> distant.</p>
<p>Quick caveat: be <i>frank</i>, not cruel. Since distance may be driven by depression and anxiety, avoiding harsh criticism is best. But many people don&#8217;t recognize their own distancing <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/identifying-avoidant-partner-improve-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">behavior</a>, and a heads-up might do them a favor.</p>
<h2>Pay attention to what works</h2>
<p>Whenever you interact, keep close tabs on what works — and what makes them shy away. Did sharing your own struggles encourage them, or did you find them more distant after that chat? Did they make an effort to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/10/why-some-people-isolate-and-some-reach-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reach out</a> more often after you told them how their distance makes you feel? You don&#8217;t want to smother someone who prefers less interaction.</p>
<h2>Respect Your Differences</h2>
<p>Remember, every person is different. Depending on the reasons for their distance, they may respond better to different approaches. Get to know them and you&#8217;ll be better able to predict what makes them tick.</p>
<p>Making friends is important — as is getting to know old friends and family better. But if the distance grates on your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/why-successful-people-struggle-with-mental-illness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health</a>, take a time-out break for your <i>own</i> sake. And if their unresponsiveness leaves you sad, talking with your therapist can help you set expectations or barriers.</p>

These lucky people often couple up and ride off into a beautiful sunset&#8230;until, of course, life stressors get in the way and interrupt the honeymoon phase.</p>
<p>Other people, however, see commitment in less idealized terms. It is common to say that there is something wrong with people who have “commitment issues,” but that’s reductive and a little simplistic in most cases. In actuality, there are many factors contributing to what we call commitment issues, and they run the gamut from psychological to evolutionary.<span id="more-11439"></span></p>
<h2>1. Attachment Issues</h2>
<p>People with avoidant attachment find it difficult to connect to others in an interdependent way. Avoidant attachment comes from learning in <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/09/childhood-attachment-styles-influence-adult-relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">childhood</a> that a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/dont-get-along-with-your-parents-a-therapists-tips-for-how-to-manage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parent</a> cannot be counted upon to provide reliably for your emotional needs.</p>
<p>In adulthood, these individuals focus mainly on being self-reliant, and merging their life with that of a partner feels scary and uncomfortable. Even when they are in love, they often are hesitant to jump into commitment with both feet.</p>
<h2>2. You’re Not With the Right Partner</h2>
<p>Sometimes, people stay in a stable <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/09/relationship-sabotage-when-going-well/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relationship</a> even when they know on a deep level that their partner isn’t a good fit, or they’re not in love with that person.</p>
<p>The desire for safety and security outweighs their suspicion that they will never feel entirely fulfilled with their partner. Fear of change prevents them from moving on, but their partner often perceives their ambivalence as fear of commitment.</p>
<h2>3. Your Partner Refuses to Work on Key Issues That Bother You</h2>
<p>Long term, you may fear that certain issues will preclude a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/what-is-happiness-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happy</a> marriage with your partner.</p>
<p>For example, if your partner has untreated depression, you may fear that you will be attaching yourself to someone who cannot truly enjoy life with you. If your partner refuses to get treatment, you may well feel ambivalence about commitment to them.</p>
<h2>4. You Tend to Self-Sabotage</h2>
<p>There are many people who subconsciously tend to sabotage anything good that may come their way. Often, this is due to a childhood where good things never happened, or where good things ended too quickly.</p>
<p>For example, growing up with a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depressed</a> or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/alcohol-abuse-signs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alcoholic</a> parent, you often learn that most interactions are unpredictable and don’t end well. In adulthood, you may shy away from a relationship that feels too good, because you fear the other shoe may drop.</p>
<h2>5. Monogamy is Difficult</h2>
<p>Evolutionarily speaking, people were never supposed to mate forever, especially now that our lifespans have dramatically increased.</p>
<p>People in long term relationships may feel a lessening of their sexual desire for their partner over time. Many people who are scared of commitment are also scared of the idea of their, and their partner’s, desire waning significantly over time.</p>
<h2>Does This Sound Familiar?</h2>
<p>If any, or many, of these issues resonate with you, you may find it beneficial to speak with a therapist. It is essential to figure out which part of your “commitment issues” are due to you, and which parts are due to other factors, like the relationship as a whole or overall differences in personality.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/02/everything-you-need-to-know-about-couples-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couples counseling</a> can be useful for those who believe they would commit if key issues were worked through and resolved. Individually or as a couple, discussing your feelings, your relationship history, and your family background can often illuminate what relationship direction you should choose.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you keep secrets from your family?</p>
<p>If you’re mentally rifling through all the skeletons in your family closet, you’re definitely not alone. Even those who pride themselves on openness probably have a secret or two that they’re not willing to share — even with the people they hold most dear. From issues as traumatic as sexual violence, to those as relatively mild (but still potentially contentious) as who we vote for, most of us have secrets we’d rather not share with our families.<span id="more-11341"></span></p>
<p>Keeping certain things to ourselves can be a normal and healthy aspect of privacy. But more serious secrets — those that are motivated by <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/when-you-feel-trapped-in-a-shame-spiral-try-this/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shame</a>, or that could potentially impact a family member’s wellbeing — can haunt families for years and disrupt healthy familial bonds.</p>
<p>But how can we tell the difference between healthy privacy and harmful secret keeping? And if we do choose to open up about tough subjects, how can we preserve our family relationships — if it’s healthy to preserve them at all?</p>
<p>I caught up with Rachel O’Neill, Ph.D., an Ohio-licensed professional clinical counselor and Talkspace therapist, for a conversation about why families keep secrets, and how to talk about the things we’d rather keep secret.</p>
<h2>Why Do Our Loved Ones Keep Secrets?</h2>
<p>“Every family is different, but I think in general families tend to keep secrets around things that they have some sort of shame associated with,” says Dr. O’Neill. Besides shame, family members can be motivated to keep secrets if they fear that revealing something would upset the family equilibrium or have implications in the broader community.</p>
<p>Some common secrets Dr. O’Neill sees in her practice include <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/identity-and-expression-what-does-gender-got-to-do-with-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gender and sexual identity</a>; physical, sexual, or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/addiction-mental-illness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">substance abuse</a>; or even an unpopular political opinion (something Dr. O’Neill says she’s seeing families hide more often in the current political climate). In the wake of the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/10/one-year-after-metoo-movement/" target="”_blank”">#MeToo movement</a>, Dr. O’Neill also says she’s heard from a number of people who have been inspired to open up about sexual violence they previously kept secret.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, secret keeping isn’t motivated by shame but rather, by the desire to protect someone. This often takes the form of a parent or caregiver trying to protect a child from information they think would be too painful. However, says Dr. O’Neill, this desire to protect can sometimes backfire.</p>
<p>“Oftentimes <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/childrens-mental-health-worry-take-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parents and caregivers</a> tend to try to do what they think is in the best interest of a person, of their child, and I think sometimes that is misguided,” she says, citing examples of parents not telling children they were adopted or not being open with children about the death of a loved one.</p>
<p>In these situations, Dr. O’Neill advises that honesty is the best policy. “The more honest we can become in these family relationships the more we can decrease the long-held stigma and the shame associated with these kinds of secrets.”</p>
<h2>Healthy Privacy vs. Harmful Secret Keeping</h2>
<p>Not all secret keeping is unhealthy, however. After all, we all have parts of ourselves that we don’t wish to share with anyone else, or parts of ourselves we reserve for spaces outside the family — whether that be the exact details of our <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/11/voting-mental-health-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting</a> records or of our sexual escapades.</p>
<p>“When I hear ‘keeping a secret,’ to me there’s that aspect of wanting to rid oneself of it, that idea of keeping this as a burden,” Dr. O’Neill says. On the other hand, she defines privacy as an active choice that the person is okay with. With privacy, says Dr. O’Neill, a person feels “a level of comfort with having decided to not share this information.”</p>
<p>Research backs up this distinction. A recent study found that the psychologically stressful part of secret keeping isn’t actual the act of lying about your secret. Instead, it’s the stress of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/05/shhhhh/526581/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">thinking about</a> the secret so much, and therefore feeling inauthentic. It stands to reason, then, that people who feel comfortable with their secret may obsess about it less.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are some secrets that definitely shouldn’t be kept. If your secret could negatively impact someone else’s health and safety, it’s important that you come forward. Pressuring someone else to keep quiet about potentially harmful issues is also a major no-no.</p>
<p>According to Dr. O’Neill, this kind of enforced secret keeping unfortunately often occurs around instances of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/10/types-of-domestic-violence-signs-what-you-can-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">family violence</a> and substance abuse.</p>
<p>“It becomes this network of secret keeping,” she says. “There’s the perpetrator, the person who’s perpetrating the abuse or the substance abuse and there’s those individuals around them who are intent on keeping that information a secret.” This becomes an abusive pattern in which survivors are made to, in Dr. O’Neill’s words, “suffer in silence.”</p>
<p>This is reflected in the statistics about sexual violence. According the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN), 2 out of 3 sexual assaults go unreported to the police. Among survivors who didn’t report, <a href="https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">7% said</a> they didn’t want the perpetrator to get in trouble. And overwhelmingly, perpetrators are close to victims, with <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/sexual-assault-victims/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">33% of rape victims</a> assaulted by an intimate partner and <a href="https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">34% of the people who abuse children</a> are their family members.</p>
<h2>The Courage to Open Up</h2>
<p>“We tend to make changes in our life when we become uncomfortable with something,” says Dr. O’Neill. She says that people often choose to reveal family secrets when an outside event inspires the revelation, or when it simply becomes too burdensome to keep the secret inside.</p>
<p>This makes sense, considering that secrets can feel like an actual, physical burden. One <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22390267" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">2012 study</a> found that people who were preoccupied with secrets perceived hills to be steeper, distances farther, and physical tasks more onerous than those without secrets. The more we think about secrets, the study found, the heavier they seem. That’s why opening up about the secrets that are weighing on us can feel like a literal unburdening.</p>
<h2>The Discomfort of Revealing Family Secrets</h2>
<p>When family secrets are revealed, however, this sense of unburdening can also be accompanied by serious discomfort, as truths we assumed about the people we’re close to change rapidly. In the wake of such revelations, Dr. O’Neill says, the path to healing depends on what the family members’ previous <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relationships</a> were like, as well as the nature of the secret.</p>
<p>In situations where the family members have an otherwise good relationship and the secret, though potentially discomfiting, was kept with the best of intentions — for example, an otherwise loving family keeping the real cause of a family member’s death secret with the intention of protecting a child — there is potential for the family members to work through the issues and heal.</p>
<p>In contrast, when the family relationship was already strained or the secret was harmful, like physical or sexual abuse, healing can be much more fraught.</p>
<p>Dr. O’Neill says that it’s best to tailor responses to what impacted individuals want. In cases of violence and abuse, she says, one of the most important things is to remember that the survivor is never responsible for what happened to them and should not have to take on the burden of coming forward if they don’t want to.</p>
<p>“My goal with working with folks is always to help foster a sense of acceptance around what has happened in the past,” she says. “If you choose never to come forward, you’re not responsible for this person continuing to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/is-it-a-normal-fight-or-verbal-abuse-heres-how-to-tell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abuse</a>, that’s just simply not fair for a survivor to have to bear that burden.”</p>
<p>Sometimes, healing can best occur by taking the person who offended out of the picture entirely, i.e., removing them from your life. In any case, O’Neill says it’s most important to first prioritize the needs of the survivor and then, if they wish, engage with the family unit.</p>
<h2>Healing Relationships</h2>
<p>While it’s definitely possible to heal individually <i>and</i> as a family after the revelation of a disruptive secret, it’s best to establish an atmosphere of healthy honesty in the family from the beginning.</p>
<p>Many issues that were once stigmatized, like adoption, divorce, and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/07/mental-health-problems-bisexual-men-and-women-deal-with/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LGBT sexuality</a>, are becoming increasingly accepted. Talking about these issues with openness and honesty right off the bat helps affirm to all family members that their experiences aren’t shameful, but are normal and valued.</p>
<p>In these situations, honesty is a form of love. When it comes to preventing abuse, experts advise being open about healthy sexuality and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/parenting/wp/2015/02/13/its-never-too-early-to-teach-children-about-consent-and-boundaries/?utm_term=.809b5456ebdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">teaching children healthy boundaries</a> beginning from early childhood.</p>
<p>By cultivating honesty within families, we can prevent issues from happening or deal with them in a healthy manner when they do arise. Of course, if you do still choose to keep some things within the bounds of healthy privacy, we promise we won’t tell grandma about your new boyfriend.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’re bound to get into an argument every once in a while — whether it&#8217;s with your partner a family member, a friend, or a complete stranger. We all possess strong thoughts, aspirations, and opinions that sometimes transform everyday conversations into disputes. But while our tendency to disagree may be shared, did you know that everyone has a different &#8220;fighting style&#8221; that provides a glimpse into their mental health, too?</p>
<p><span id="more-11309"></span></p>
<p>How you respond to an argument and the tactics and strategies you use to confront a verbal altercation says a lot about your emotional and mental state. Since few of us are strangers to the realm of combative discussions, you may be asking yourself, “What does my fighting strategy reveal about my inner thoughts and mental health?”</p>
<p>Below, are outlined a list of the typical fighting styles used by individuals when they get into a heated discussion or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/is-it-a-normal-fight-or-verbal-abuse-heres-how-to-tell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argument</a> — and what these tactics show about your personality and emotional state.</p>
<h2>1. Personal Attacks</h2>
<p>Research studies show that <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ab.21601" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">individuals with low self-esteem were much more likely to show hostility</a> and aggression toward others when compared to their confident and more secure counterparts.</p>
<p>And nothing is more aggressive or unproductive during an argument than ad hominem attacks on the other person’s character, rather than sticking to the topic at hand. If you tend to break down your opponent by using the information you know about their character as a leverage point, you may want to stop and evaluate how you’d feel if you were in their shoes.</p>
<p>When people struggle with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/why-your-self-esteem-is-fake-and-what-to-do-about-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-esteem</a>, they can be their own worst enemy and may pick apart their own character traits and flaws. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s not uncommon for these same individuals to resort to &#8220;below the belt&#8221; tactics in an argument, too.</p>
<h2>2. Accepting Defeat or Faking Indifference</h2>
<p>In many ways, those who accept defeat or feign indifference during a fight are the same. In both instances, the individual doesn’t open up their inner thoughts — regardless of their reasoning.</p>
<p>Whether you fear that your argument is invalid or you can&#8217;t find the strength within you to craft an argument or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/best-way-fight-partner-according-therapist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fight</a>, merely accepting defeat or pretending you don&#8217;t care may indicate that you think others may find it difficult to understand your thoughts.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/11-habits-of-people-with_b_6384062" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">a common symptom of depression</a>, as individuals who grapple with this mental illness often seek love — rather than arguments or disputes, simply because they don’t have the emotional energy. Whenever it appears their opinions don&#8217;t align with those of the opposing party, they may act indifferent or accept defeat in an attempt to feel more loved and accepted.</p>
<h2>3. The Silent Treatment</h2>
<p>Maybe you’re the type of person who applies the silent treatment tactic every time an argument or heated discussion appears to arise. If you’ve found yourself on the receiving end of the proclamation of “Why aren’t you saying anything to me?” then you may be wondering what this says about your mental state.</p>
<p>While you may have been called out on your quiet tendencies in the past, it may actually be a good thing that you become an active listener whenever a fight erupts. There are <a href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/17/09/value-listening" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">many benefits to being quiet</a> during an argument, especially when your rival is emotional or loud.</p>
<p>If your natural tendency is to take the silent approach during a fight, it may serve as an indication of sound mental health and that you acknowledge that proactive discussions and resolution often arise when one speaker remains calm.</p>
<p>Just be sure to evaluate whether you’re <i>choosing</i> to give the silent treatment, as making this calculated choice could indicate you’re acting emotionally distant toward to your “opponent.”</p>
<h2>4. Openness and Honesty</h2>
<p>Perhaps one of the healthiest fighting styles that indicates a positive mental state is adopting a style that promotes both openness and honesty — offering a platform for every party involved in the discussion to speak.</p>
<p>Those who don’t communicate openly and honestly may do well to try to learn and practice. An open and honest fighting style generally <a href="https://www.loveisrespect.org/healthy-relationships/communicate-better/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">sees the most successful results</a> for both parties at the end of an argument.</p>
<h2>Find Your Balance</h2>
<p>When you establish a sense of respect that lets you and your &#8220;opponent&#8221; work through the argument with ease, you&#8217;ll experience an easier time overcoming whatever difficulties or opposing views arise.</p>
<p>Since psychology reveals that <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/conflict-matters/201802/the-benefits-arguing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">getting into healthy arguments can be beneficial</a> to your relationships, it’s crucial to develop a constructive fighting style that not only helps you enjoy deep and proactive communication, but that also enhances a healthy mental state.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You probably think you’re a team player. At least, you’ve white-lied that you are in job interviews. But even the most community-minded of us dig our heels in once in a while (because we’re right, darn it!). From our intimate relationships to our political process, why is it so hard to compromise?</p>
<p><span id="more-11302"></span></p>
<p>From social psychology to neurobiology, researchers have found that social cooperation is a deeply-ingrained aspect of human behavior — so deep, in fact, that it’s wired into the structure of our brains. On top of this, a number of situational and social factors affect how willing we are to compromise, including our own moral compass and the nature of our relationship with the other person.</p>
<p>Whether we’re talking the boardroom or the bedroom, here’s why finding win-win solutions can be so tough — and how to make healthy compromises while staying true to your core values.</p>
<h2>The Science of Cooperation</h2>
<p>Compromise, like other kinds of cooperation, is deeply ingrained in what it means to be human, from our evolutionary past and our neurological makeup.</p>
<p>Our brains are <a href="http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1537/165.short" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">structured to be social</a>, equipped with features like <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/oct05/mirror.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">mirror neurons</a> that allow us to empathize with people around us. The hormones <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0018506X10000188" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Oxytocin</a> (yup, the one that <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/275795.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">helps make sex</a> feel so good) and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432812002938" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">serotonin</a> are associated with prosocial behavior, reflecting what scientists have called our brains’ “bias for cooperation.” In fact, studies have found that exposing people to Oxytocin can increase humans’ willingness to cooperate — but only when we are in a social situation amenable to compromise, like when we’re with a friend or someone we feel socially connected to.</p>
<p>This bias toward collaboration reaches deep into our evolutionary past. Some evolutionary biologists <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519308000970" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">theorize</a> that human societies developed a deep emphasis on cooperation precisely because human beings aren’t shy about resorting to force. Compromise may have developed as a virtue in human societies precisely because the results of refusing to compromise are so dangerous (say, war), and the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3340565/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">benefits</a> so useful (agriculture!).</p>
<p>In our daily lives, social and situational factors make us more or less likely to compromise. Researchers have found that people with strong moral convictions or <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/611974/why-political-compromise-hard" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">more extreme positions</a> are <a href="http://www.isr.umich.edu/cps/events/TRyan%20No%20Compromise.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">less likely</a> to compromise on things directly related to these deeply-held beliefs. This can lead to seemingly nonsensical stubborness, as studies show that people are often more likely to choose inaction over a gain that requires even a little bit of compromise with people they disagree with.</p>
<p>On the other hand, research has found that people with higher emotional intelligence and self-awareness are <a href="https://www.sid.ir/En/Journal/ViewPaper.aspx?ID=250328" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">more likely to compromise</a>. People are also <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-04200-010" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">more likely</a> to cooperate with people they perceive to be part of their group, making empathy key to healthy cooperation.</p>
<h2>When to Compromise — And When to Stick to Your Guns</h2>
<p>There’s one thing the science of compromise can’t teach us: When should we do it? From politics to personal <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relationships</a>, we tend to celebrate compromise as a virtue. But in what situations is compromise truly win-win, and when is it best to stick to our values?</p>
<p>When it comes to interpersonal relationships, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">therapists</a> advise being clear with yourself about what things are negotiable, and what needs or values are so core to who you are you’re unwilling to give them up.</p>
<p>In approaching compromise for the sake of an intimate relationship, Dr. Mark D. White, a therapist writing in <i>Psychology Today</i>, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/maybe-its-just-me/201106/how-much-should-you-compromise-your-relationship" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">recommends</a> asking yourself a simple question: is this relationship serving me, or am I serving this relationship? If you’re making sacrifices to serve a relationship that isn’t serving you, it’s probably time to reevaluate.</p>
<p>And while every relationship requires being flexible and prioritizing someone else’s needs as well as your own, there are <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/10/how-much-should-you-compromise-in-a-relationship_a_23237905/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">certain things</a> that definitely aren’t up for debate: your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/guide-setting-healthy-boundaries-relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexual boundaries</a>, for example, or your personal safety.</p>
<h2>How to be a Team Player</h2>
<p>After you’ve decided that you’re willing to compromise in a situation, how do you do it without making yourself or the other person feel like you’ve come up short?</p>
<h3>Meet in person</h3>
<p>You don’t have to be a PhD in psychology to guess that successful cooperation depends on one all-important factor: communication. Research has found that face-to-face conversations are <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/30909307/_EB_B0_9C_EB_A6_AC_EC_97_A3__EC_82_AC_ED_9A_8C_EC_A0_81__EB_94_9C_EB_A0_88_EB_A7_88_EC_97_90_EC_84_9C__EC_9D_98_EC_82_AC_EC_86_8C_ED_86_.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1541112917&amp;Signature=wqcJ09aP5SdXc7NYru9LWUUysQI%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DCommunication_and_cooperation_in_social.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">more effective</a> at promoting cooperation than written messages, so if you’re experiencing a conflict or trying to compromise, do what us <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2015/07/15/why-millennials-are-texting-more-and-talking-less/#33297fe65975" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">text-loving Millennials</a> won’t: meet in person.</p>
<p>When you do meet the other person, begin with considering where both of you are coming from. Writing in <i>Psychology Today</i>, therapist and attorney David Bedrick <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/is-psychology-making-us-sick/201304/compromise-or-not-compromise" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">suggests</a> taking a “psychological approach” to compromise. While conventional models encourage both parties in a disagreement to give something up equally in a compromise, a psychological approach considers where each person is coming from and <i>why </i>they’re resistant to compromise in the first place.</p>
<h3>Listen intently and understand each party’s needs</h3>
<p>Bedrick suggests that when people are unwilling to compromise, they may have important reasons for that unwillingness. It’s healthier to understand and address those reasons rather than force someone into an agreement they don’t feel comfortable making. By striving to meet any unmet needs both parties have, rather than just pushing them to compromise without examining where they’re coming from, we can achieve solutions that are actually better for both people.</p>
<p>Direct, empathic listening can also go a long way. Writing in the <i>Harvard Review of Business</i>, executive coach John Baldoni <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/10/compromising-when-compromise-i" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">advises</a> working toward compromise by asking open questions to make the other person feel heard. Asking questions like “Why do you feel that way?” or “Help me understand this issue more clearly” can encourage you to understand the perspective of someone you may at first view as an opponent, making you better able to reach a truly win-win resolution.</p>
<h2>Learn to Embrace the Win-Win Scenario</h2>
<p>While compromise may mean giving something up, you can make healthy compromises without neglecting your core values and needs. And by communicating clearly and empathetically considering another person’s perspective, you’ll find that by giving something up, compromising gives you something essential in return: stronger, healthier relationships.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nobody is immune to rejection. Even the most beautiful and talented people have been rejected in one way or another. When you take risks in life, you face the possibility that you might be shut down or might not make the cut.</p>
<p><span id="more-11294"></span></p>
<p>Different phases of life bring different opportunities and situations where we’ve got to put ourselves out there and be vulnerable. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/6-quick-tips-to-maintain-your-mental-health-while-dating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dating</a>, high school sports tryouts, college applications, and job interviews are a few prime examples. There’s a reason you probably shudder at the thought of these experiences — they all come with a reasonable chance of rejection, and the odds are pretty good that you’ve experienced rejection already in one of these contexts<i>. </i></p>
<p>As much as we’d like for everything to always go our way, that’s not the way the universe works. While rejection is pretty much inevitable in some capacity, it still hurts. It’s painful to get shut down for something you want, whether it’s a date with a crush or a job at your dream company. We all want to be loved, cherished, and accepted — be it by a romantic partner, friend group, or boss.</p>
<p>Rejection can cause us to feel a slew of emotions, ranging from confusion to sadness to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/anger-emotions-run-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rage</a>. Oftentimes, people don’t understand exactly why they’ve been rejected, which can lead to a downward spiral of negative introspection and an overall sense of not feeling “good enough.”</p>
<p>Social and romantic rejection can be especially traumatic and negative for our self esteem. “Humans are inherently social creatures. We crave connection and meaning to others. When faced with rejection, or lack of acceptance, it&#8217;s hard of us to not internalize negative thoughts about our own self-worth. Rejection brings up the existential crisis of ‘alone-ness,’ which is quite painful and hard to ignore,” <a href="https://twitter.com/jorelcaraballo?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Jor-El Caraballo</a>, LMHC and Talkspace therapist, explains.</p>
<h2>The Science of Rejection</h2>
<p>On top of being hard to ignore, instances of rejection can also be pretty hard to forget.</p>
<p>Personally, I remember moments of rejection even as far back as elementary school. I had a huge crush on a boy in my class, and during lunch time I asked him who he thought was prettier, me or this other girl in class. He chose — you guessed it — the other girl. It hurt! I remember that day, and how it felt to hear those words, vividly. I’ve wondered, why is this memory and the feelings around it still so clear to me?</p>
<p>“Memories are complex processes that occur in the brain. Highly emotional experiences, like rejection, get stored in the brain and remain there thanks to the amygdala [a part of the brain] that attaches meaning to experience,” Caraballo says. “If you&#8217;re someone who has struggled with rejection, and that gets reinforced in various scenarios so that it gains meaning and importance — even in small ways — that rejection turns into our pervading emotional story.”</p>
<p>Besides the fact that being rejected straight up <i>sucks</i>, there’s actually scientific data and evolutionary research that helps us better understand the pain of rejection, and why the pain is so distinct.</p>
<p><a href="https://sanlab.psych.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2015/05/Eisenberger2012PsychosamaticMed.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Studies using MRI brain scans</a> have shown that the same region of the brain that is activated while experiencing physical pain is also activated while experiencing emotional pain, like rejection. However, there’s an interesting difference to be noted when it comes to re-living emotional pain.</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0128294&amp;type=printable" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Another study showed</a> that re-living emotional pain is more unpleasant, and results in more brain activity, than re-living physical pain. The study also confirmed that it’s easier for us to recount details and feelings from occurrences of emotional pain than physical pain. This explains why it hurts more to reflect on the time you got dumped than to the time you broke your arm.</p>
<p>Continuing with the “broken arm” example, we get patched up and are typically as good as new in a few months. Emotional pain, however, can linger for decades if we don’t learn ways to heal its lasting wounds.</p>
<h2>How to Recover from Rejection</h2>
<p>So, how do you pick yourself back up after facing rejection? There are a few things you can do to make yourself feel better about the situation&#8230;and prepare yourself better for the next time you may face rejection.</p>
<h3>Allow yourself to feel</h3>
<p>Rather than suppressing all the emotions that come with rejection, allow yourself to feel and process them. Holding in your negative emotions and bottling up all the feelings is no good for you.</p>
<p>“I think that like many other experiences we often tell people that their feelings don&#8217;t matter and they should ‘just get over it.’ We could really stand to focus more on creating space for people to feel their feelings, even rejection, and find ways to feel it and cope rather than just ignoring the pain and making it all better,” Caraballo says.</p>
<h3>Spend time with people who accept you</h3>
<p>Surround yourself with people who love you and accept you. While it may be tempting to isolate yourself further when you&#8217;re feeling upset over rejection, it’s important to be at least a little social with loved ones.</p>
<p>Remember that you <i>are </i>loved and appreciated, and don’t let an act of rejection make you believe otherwise. You can’t always be accepted for every opportunity or by every person — and that’s okay! The people around you will remind you that you’re loved and valued.</p>
<h3>Practice self love and self care</h3>
<p>It’s <i>so </i>important to love and have a positive relationship with yourself. Doing so will help you be more resilient with future instances of rejection.</p>
<p>Make a list of the positive traits you have that you’re proud of, inside and out. Appreciate the parts of yourself that you love, and work on cultivating good self esteem. You can also make a list of your accomplishments, both big and small.</p>
<p>Be sure to carve some time out for <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/self-care-stop-stress-secrets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self care</a>. You can journal or create art to express your emotions, take a hot bath to zone out, or head to a fitness class like kickboxing to burn off some anger.</p>
<h2>Rejection is a Natural Part of Our Lives, Embrace it!</h2>
<p>So, next time you’re facing rejection (which hopefully won’t be soon) remember that your feelings are totally valid, and it’s okay to feel sad when you’re going through it.</p>
<p>It’s a part of this crazy ride we call life, and if you want to live it to the fullest, you’ve gotta pick yourself back up when you get knocked down.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The anxiety starts in my chest and then blooms, smothering my lungs and filling my belly: a guy has just asked me out. <i>Oh no</i>, I think, panicked. <i>Am I interested? How do I turn him down?</i></p>
<p><span id="more-11289"></span></p>
<p>I’m not a character in a preteen novel, with butterflies in her stomach because she’s never been asked on a date. It’s definitely not my first rodeo. I have, however, had bad experiences of being asked out by men who couldn’t take no for an answer — including one guy who harassed me online for two years after I declined a date with him. With <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/21/587671849/a-new-survey-finds-eighty-percent-of-women-have-experienced-sexual-harassment" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">81 percent</a> of women having experienced some kind of sexual harassment, I’m definitely not alone in this anxiety.</p>
<p>But even for people who haven’t experienced <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/sexual-harassment-is-about-mental-health-not-only-the-workplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harassment</a>, turning someone down can be pretty, well, awkward. Walking the line between clarity and tact can feel like a serious high-wire act. This can be especially true for women, who are often trained to prioritize other people’s feelings over our own boundaries.</p>
<p>So what’s a person to do? To find out, I consulted the experts: Rachel O’Neill, Ph.D., an Ohio-licensed professional clinical counselor and Talkspace therapist, and Olivia Harris, a consent educator and Incoming Executive Director of <a href="http://speakaboutitonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Speak About It,</a> a nonprofit group that uses performance to educate high school and college students about consent.</p>
<p>Here’s what they had to say about why turning down someone’s romantic attention can be so darn tricky, and how you can learn to assert your boundaries with grace and aplomb.</p>
<h2>Saying “No” Can Be Difficult</h2>
<p>Whether we’re asking someone out or turning someone down, most of us want to be kind. “The vast majority of people don’t want to be jerks or hurt somebody,” says Olivia Harris.</p>
<p>However, harmful cultural messages about gender and consent, like the idea that a woman’s “no” is sometimes a coquettish “yes,” can make turning down a date particularly difficult for women, whose “no’s” often aren’t listened to or respected. These cultural messages often result in the expectation that women should be responsible for making other people feel good, even at the expense of our own boundaries.</p>
<p>“Feminine people are taught to read the room and do the emotional caretaking of everyone’s feelings,” Harris says.</p>
<p>Dr. Rachel O’Neill agrees. “Often times, people, and women in particular, are socialized to put others’ feelings above their own,” she says.</p>
<h2>Practice Articulating Your Boundaries</h2>
<p>In the face of these cultural messages, saying “no” can take some practice.</p>
<p>It may feel uncomfortable at first, but according to Dr. O’Neill, a little discomfort is worth it. “I’m a big fan of embracing the awkwardness,” she says.</p>
<p>When it comes to turning someone down, Dr. O’Neill advises embracing the awkward by simply being direct. “First and foremost, your primary responsibility is to firmly establish that you’re not interested,” she says. O’Neill also suggests simply saying that you appreciate their interest, but don’t feel the same way.</p>
<p>Like everything else in life, practice makes perfect. Dr. O’Neill suggests practicing saying no in lower-stakes situations: <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/working-hard-burning-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not answering a non-urgent work email after hours</a>, for example, or asking to reschedule when you don’t feel like going out to dinner with friends. That way, when faced with a more high-pressure situation, you’ll feel more comfortable expressing exactly what you’re comfortable with.</p>
<p>Consent isn’t just about saying “yes” or “no” to someone else’s suggestions, it’s also about knowing yourself and what you want. From <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/11/the-complete-online-dating-guide-for-women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dating</a> to sex, “you have to learn how to drive your own car,” Olivia Harris says.</p>
<p>You can reflect on your own desires and boundaries by journaling, talking with friends or a therapist, or using a “Yes, No, Maybe” checklist like <a href="http://www.scarleteen.com/article/advice/yes_no_maybe_so_a_sexual_inventory_stocklist" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">this one</a> from sexual health website Scarleteen. Knowing what you want out of dating and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/sex/">sex</a>, before you find yourself in a flirty situation, can help you figure out whether you <i>really </i>want to go on a date with that cutie at the bar.</p>
<p>Finally, no matter the romantic situation, you <i>always </i>have the right to say no, and to have that “no” respected.</p>
<h2>Learn to Accept Rejection</h2>
<p>Learning how to reject someone is just one half of the equation. What about the person who’s getting rejected?</p>
<p>Dealing with rejection is an important part of consent. By shifting the onus of respectful behavior from the person being asked out to the person doing the asking, Harris says, we can establish interactions based on healthy consent. This can help take the pressure of navigating boundaries off of women.</p>
<p>Because of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/how-men-can-confront-toxic-masculinity-why-its-important-for-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cultural stereotypes</a> around masculinity and consent, this can be a particular challenge for men. “The first step is teaching folks to listen and respect other people’s boundaries,” says Harris, “I think particularly what we’re seeing over and over again is men and masculine folks are not recognizing when they’re hitting boundaries — they’re not taught to.”</p>
<p>To change these attitudes, Harris advocates flipping the script from understanding someone’s “no” as a challenge to viewing it as a boundary that needs to be respected. That requires viewing the other person as a complete human being, rather than viewing them through the lens of our desires. It also requires learning not to take rejection too personally.</p>
<p>Quoting a line from <a href="http://speakaboutitonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Speak About It’s</a> performance, Harris says, “If you’re the person who’s asking and gets rejected, we can guarantee you it might hurt, but you won’t burst into flame.”</p>
<h2>Better Communication Leads to Better Relationships</h2>
<p>Learning how to articulate and respect boundaries isn’t just important in turning someone down, it’s fundamental to healthy relationships.</p>
<p>After all, if someone asking you out won’t take no for an answer, they probably won’t be a very respectful partner. Conversely, being able to communicate your own boundaries isn’t just helpful with people you <i>don’t </i>want to date, it’s a fundamental skill in building healthy relationships with the people you <i>do </i>want to date.</p>
<p>For Dr. Rachel O’Neill, learning to embrace the awkward and express our boundaries clearly, even when that means navigating rejection, is key to romantic happiness. “After all,” she says, “aren’t all great <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relationships</a> built on communication?”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cohabitation is the practice of living with another person while in a relationship, typically of a romantic or sexual nature.</p>
<p>Cohabitation is relatively common these days, with some past estimates (<a href="https://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/p20-570.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">from 2012</a>) indicating that as many as 7.8 million couples were living together, unmarried. This number has dramatically increased in the past few decades as our culture has shifted from a more religious and conservative stance to a more progressive and practical (though anxious) one.</p>
<p>It’s almost more uncommon to meet a couple who hasn’t taken the proverbial “test drive” in cohabiting before marriage. It’s a relatively practical solution to difficult emotional problem — how two people can coexist peacefully and happily under the same roof.</p>
<p><span id="more-11048"></span></p>
<p>Living together can be complicated, but when you are practiced and prepared, it can be an incredibly fulfilling experience.</p>
<h2>First, Embrace Collaboration</h2>
<p>If you’re moving in with your partner, in order to be successful it’s going to require the spirit of collaboration and compromise for both of you. From residence size, price, location, etc., there is a lot to figure out!</p>
<p>Start these conversations with the spirit of collaboration so that you can begin your cohabitation journey on the right foot.</p>
<h2>Take Advice From Friends or Family With a Grain of Salt</h2>
<p>If you tell your friends and family that you plan on moving in with your significant other, there is a high probability that you’re going to get a lot of feedback. Chances are, if it’s your first time moving in with someone, the people around you may have a lot of thoughts and input to share, in hopes of preparing you for success. They are likely to share their own challenges and maybe even the pitfalls they imagine their advice can help you avoid. Some may even think they know your situation better than you. Be cautious but considerate of this feedback, which is typically well-intentioned</p>
<p>No two <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relationships</a> are the same, therefore no cohabitation is exactly the same. Stereotypes are lazy, and gross generalizations about your partner (or men and women in general) are unhelpful when considering this next big step in a relationship.</p>
<p>As you plan to move in with your loved one, take all (unsolicited) advice with a grain of salt. Talk through your concerns with your partner, and try to let the other noise and chatter fall into the background.</p>
<p>On the other hand, don’t forget to do some research of your own, and identify the most important things to consider when moving in together. Input from professionals can help reassure you that you’re making the right decision.</p>
<h2>Take Time to Reflect and Prepare</h2>
<p>Moving in with another person is a big step. If you haven’t lived with a significant other before you may not know what’s most important to you in a shared space.</p>
<p>While you’re still “riding solo,” take a bit of time to do a walk through of your residence (physically and/or mentally). Think of the ordinary things you do that seem benign and natural to you, and take note of them. While these things may seem “right” to you, your partner might have a completely different approach to living. Some things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>How and where you store your grooming products (how many do you have)?</li>
<li>Where and how you store laundry</li>
<li>How you deal with garbage &amp; recycling (where is it located in the home &amp; how often do you dispose of it)?</li>
<li>How often do you clean? Are there must haves for cleaning products, etc.?</li>
</ul>
<p>These may sound silly in the grand scheme of living with someone, but in my experience it’s the little things that really grind your gears on a day-to-day basis. By walking into the shared home with an idea of your pet peeves or related personality clashes, you can preempt these conflicts by proposing solutions or compromises. This will enable you and your partner to focus on the greater emotional impact and changes associated with living together.</p>
<h2>Some Serious Things to Consider in Cohabitation</h2>
<p>There are some not-so-pleasant realities of living together. There will be challenges simply in sharing common space, and as with any relationship, there will also be <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/best-way-fight-partner-according-therapist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conflict</a> to work through.</p>
<p>In addition, there are legal and financial concerns in cohabitating. Partners do well by talking about these issues beforehand and <a href="https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/dos-and-donts-for-cohabitation.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">making some sort of agreement</a> about how finances will be managed.</p>
<p>In research on heterosexual couples, scientists found that those who lived together before marriage tend to have a higher rate of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/200507/the-perils-playing-house?collection=94907" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">marital dissatisfaction, including poorer communication</a>. It should be of note that this study didn’t include a sample of queer or LGBTQ-identified pairings.</p>
<p>And of course, there is the issue of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/07/what-happens-if-your-relationship-expires-every-7-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-term commitment</a>. The research on cohabitation indicates that those who don’t discuss the idea of commitment explicitly beforehand tend to end up in less fulfilling relationships.</p>
<p>Whether or not cohabitation or a permanent (legal) partnership is the end goal, it’s necessary for partners to explore these ideas and possibilities beforehand, rather than wait on having those conversations down the road.</p>
<h2>Choose Your Battles</h2>
<p>Moving in with your partner should not be match of tug-o-war or a battle of wills. There are likely to be plenty of lifestyle choices that you disagree on — from how the toilet paper should be on the holder to who should pay the utility bills monthly.</p>
<p>There are going to be <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/de-escalate-fight-with-partner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">battles that aren’t worth fighting</a> for any discernible amount of time. Sometimes it’s best to let some battles go to keep the relationship healthy and balanced. If you don’t feel strongly about whether you have a paper towel holder on the counter versus mounted, then perhaps defer to your partner who feels much more strongly about one of those options.</p>
<p>Knowing when to fold a bad hand is an important part of any relationship, especially when you’re going to be sharing your home with the one that you love. A <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/02/everything-you-need-to-know-about-couples-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couple&#8217;s counselor</a> can be very helpful in deciding how to mediate disputes.</p>
<h2>What to Consider if the Relationship or Cohabitation Doesn’t Work</h2>
<p>There are certain laws and precedents that dictate what might happen should you later end your relationship, and with it, cohabitation. Issues related to <a href="https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/dos-and-donts-for-cohabitation.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">marriage and domestic partnerships, property ownerships, finances, assets and child care may be important factors</a> in a separation down the line.</p>
<p>To protect yourself and your family, it may be wise to consult with a attorney about the local laws in your area concerning these topics.</p>
<h2>Finally&#8230;Expect the Unexpected</h2>
<p>Inevitably, there are going to be some unknowns you run into when moving in with another person. While there is certainly a lot you can talk through and plan for, we are human and you likely won’t address every little thing.</p>
<p>Sometimes we don’t know what matters most in our living space until we have someone else within it. The best thing we can do in those situations is make sure that we are communicating openly and honestly as much as possible.</p>
