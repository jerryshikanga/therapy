				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Almost all of us have had experiences so uncomfortable or traumatizing that we do everything in our power to push the memories or feelings aside. Or maybe there is an everyday reality we live with that feels too impossible to cope with, so we pretend it doesn’t exist, and that dealing with it is not our responsibility. <i>That is denial</i>.</p>
<p>The state of denial usually feels much more comfortable than confronting difficult feelings or circumstances. But anyone in the mental health field will tell you that living in denial for too long will only backfire. Denial may feel easier, but it actually only intensifies whatever challenging feelings you are dealing with, making them more difficult to move on from.</p>
<p><span id="more-11266"></span></p>
<h2>Can Denial Ever Be Helpful?</h2>
<p>Is there ever an amount of denial that is acceptable? Could it, in some circumstances, be protective and possibly useful as you navigate troubled times in your life?</p>
<p>Rachel O’Neill, Ph.D., professional clinical counselor and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/3-therapists-open-work-talkspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Talkspace therapist</a>, says that there <i>may </i>be circumstances where this is the case, but denial is only every helpful in very limited quantities and lengths of time.</p>
<p>“Denial is a defense mechanism and it exists to help us cope with difficult situations,” O’Neill explains. “It’s never really helpful per se, because, eventually, an individual will need to face the reality of their situation.”</p>
<p>However, in some particular instances like <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/ptsd-traumas-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traumatizing events</a>, denial may allow someone to keep a distance from the trauma until they are able to tackle it. Even then, denial is only helpful for very brief periods. “Eventually, it becomes necessary to work on finding the space to accept the circumstances of the situation,” says O’Neill.</p>
<h2>The Problem With Living in Denial</h2>
<p>So what’s so problematic about denial, and why should we all learn how to confront and accept the most difficult feelings and events we experience?</p>
<p>Avoiding the reality of a situation can be more harmful than whatever painful feelings are wrapped up in it, says O’Neill. It may feel more comfortable to pull away from the hard things, but what happens in reality is that the more you distance yourself, the deeper you plunge — usually without even knowing it.</p>
<p>“In other words, the more entrenched you get in denial, the harder it can be to pull yourself from it,” says O’Neill.</p>
<p>People who live in a state of denial will experience short-term consequences like feelings of isolation, anxiety, and sadness. Long-term consequences can include the feeling that you have never worked through your experience, and you may end up feeling perpetually “stuck” in it, O’Neill explains.</p>
<h2>How To Conquer Denial</h2>
<p>It’s pretty clear that denial is not a good place to remain, and that it should be avoided whenever possible. The problem is, because of the nature of denial and how prevalent it is, you may not even be aware that you are experiencing it!</p>
<p>It’s the ultimate Catch-22. How can you stop being in denial if you don’t know that you are in denial in the first place?</p>
<p>Usually it’s someone outside your life who can point out that you are in a place of denial. “It might be a friend or a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">therapist</a> who points out the ways in which you’re using denial to cope with a situation,” says O’Neill.</p>
<p>It goes without saying, if you are unable to cope with your feelings about an experience, finding a therapist you can trust is an excellent place for you to start. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/therapists-guide-talking-friends-family-about-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Confiding in close friends or family members</a> is helpful as well.</p>
<h3>Denial self-checks</h3>
<p>Additionally, O’Neill suggests that you can do a periodic “self-checks” with yourself to see if denial is getting the better of you. This can include asking yourself questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you spend a lot of time wishing the situation hadn’t happened or had turned out differently?</li>
<li>Do you find yourself refusing to accept a circumstance even through the circumstance is in fact a reality?</li>
</ul>
<p>If the answer to either or both of these questions is affirmative, O’Neill suggest that this is a time where you should consider exploring the ways that your state of denial may be impacting your life or ability to recover.</p>
<h2>Living in Denial Doesn’t Have to be Permanent</h2>
<p>If the circumstances that led you to denial are particularly traumatizing, you should certainly consider seeking professional help. However you work through this, be gentle with yourself.</p>
<p>Remember that as hard as it will be, it will be freeing and healing to unearth the buried feelings. And you will end up feeling better and stronger in the long-run.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So many times, we feel like we are stuck in a rut with no clear direction forward. This can happen in a range of areas, including relationships, friendships, work, self-development, or education.</p>
<p>Often, when you have been traveling down the same path for months or even years, it starts to feel like there is only one way to do things. Even if that path makes you unhappy, it feels to you like there is no other option. Here are some examples that may seem familiar.</p>
<p><span id="more-11261"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Michael is unhappy with his primary partner. They fight and don’t have much physical intimacy. Unfortunately, when he thinks about leaving, it feels like a gray cloud descends in his mind, and he feels incapable of taking action one way or the other.</li>
<li>Elizabeth has stopped exercising even though she knows it has a positive impact on her depression. Every morning, when she used to run, instead she scrolls through her phone thinking that maybe in the summer she will start again.</li>
<li>Lauren wishes that her kids listened to her more. She can’t imagine that anything would change the dynamic in her home, and doesn’t try to effect any change even after reading parenting books with ideas on how to manage kids’ behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>What all of these people have in common is that they don’t truly believe in their capacity to cause change in their lives. They are waiting for an external variable to change, because they feel such minimal agency in their own lives. This is called an external locus of control, and it means that you attribute events to external variables, rather than variables that you can control.</p>
<h2>How to Escape Stagnation</h2>
<p>To get yourself out of a rut, you need to change your locus of control to an internal one. People with an internal locus of control feel like they have the power to change their environment. They feel like they have agency in their own lives, and are making things happen versus waiting for them to happen. Here is how that would look in each of our examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael decides to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/10/how-to-find-a-therapist-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find a therapist</a> and explore why he feels so powerless and stuck in his relationship. He determines that he is scared of change and hates the idea of breaking up with someone, even if he is unhappy, because it triggers feelings of his parents’ <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/talkspace-online-therapy-1-tool-divorced-men/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">divorce</a>. Working with his therapist, he decides to offer couples counseling to his partner, and to leave if she refuses to work on things.</li>
<li>Elizabeth confides in a friend about her issues with motivation. They promise to hold one another accountable for <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/5-ways-exercise-is-great-for-your-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exercising at least 5 times a week</a>. Elizabeth also talks to her coworker and they decide to set up a walking group at lunchtime.</li>
<li>Lauren thinks deeply about why she has never tried any of the behavioral management techniques that she so diligently reads about in her parenting books. She recognizes that since her own mother acted so overwhelmed by parenting her and her brothers, she subconsciously expects parenting to be stressful and out-of-control. She resolves to try to implement a sticker chart to help her 5 year old with better listening.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that in order to feel more in control of your own life, paradoxically, you may need to reach out to others and open yourself up to accepting support and feedback. Also, introspection is necessary to figure out <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/11/therapists-guide-getting-unstuck/">why you feel so paralyzed</a>. Often, when you feel completely stuck and paralyzed in one sphere of your life, it is because childhood issues are being triggered.</p>
<p>Working with a therapist is one excellent way to explore why you feel stuck in a rut, but reading, introspection, and discussion with others can help you move forward and life the live that you want.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feeling “stuck” is an awful feeling. Stuck can quickly turn to feeling hopeless and helpless. When you can’t achieve the things that you want, the internal dialogue can quickly turn to criticism and self-blame. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to make some important changes in your life, here are some thoughts to get you unstuck.</p>
<p><span id="more-11255"></span></p>
<h2>It All Starts With Self-Reflection</h2>
<p>Getting your life unstuck can be a big challenge, and it always starts with a bit of self-reflection and exploration. In order to move forward you’re going to have to slow down and take stock of your life first. This means that you should set aside some time for quiet reflection without input and feedback from others. This can be hard to do with competing priorities and responsibilities, but it’s a necessary step.</p>
<p>When you sit down to reflect, ask yourself the following:“</p>
<ul>
<li>Where am I now?</li>
<li>What is my life like?</li>
<li>Am I doing the work that I hoped that I would do?</li>
<li>Are my relationships succeeding?</li>
<li>How would I want them to be better?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s imperative that you be as specific as possible, and to explore with a curious, non-judgemental mind. There are no right or wrong answers here! Being vague and broad with what you want will not only leave you feeling worse, but also make it difficult for you to take concrete action later on. It’s hard to problem-solve when you don’t know the actual problem, isn’t it?</p>
<h2>Reconnect Your Purpose</h2>
<p>Often when we can’t move forward, it means that we’re <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/08/dear-therapist-how-do-i-find-my-purpose-in-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">missing purpose</a> and inspiration. From an existential perspective, we need purpose as humans. That purpose could be quite broad (working to reduce instances of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/10/breast-cancer-diagnosis-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancer</a>) but could also be smaller (to help support my team at work). Each purpose is valuable and valid, no matter what it is.</p>
<p>Take some time to explore what you have been most passionate about in the past. Ask yourself, “What motivates me?” or “What has driven some of my decisions so far?” Those questions might help you identify a purpose that you’ve long been disconnected from.</p>
<h2>Take a Peek into the Future</h2>
<p>As a therapist, I’ve worked with many clients who have come into the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">therapy</a> space feeling stuck or confused about their path in life. One of the exercises that I find most helpful is an envisioning exercise. For some, looking into the ideal future can be very informative.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling stuck, try to imagine your life 10 years from now. Think about where you will be living, who you will be with, what you’ll be doing, etc. Create a mental picture of what that ideal life could look like. Maybe that’s what your heart desires!</p>
<p>Once you take a peek into the future then you might be able to start crafting a rough outline to get there. And remember, even if you pivot or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/fear-of-change-why-life-adjustments-are-difficult/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change directions</a> several times (most people do!) you still have made some progress.</p>
<h2>Try Something New</h2>
<p>Often, when we feel like we are in a rut, it’s an indication that something needs to change. Sometimes we don’t even know what that change is. When you don’t have insight into what needs to change, it can be helpful to try something new. Anything out of the ordinary, or that breaks your current routine, might give you some helpful guidance toward your next steps.</p>
<p>This could mean reading a new book for pleasure (which maybe you haven’t done in a while) or attending an event you wouldn’t normally attend. Taking a moment to step outside of yourself can jostle your system into feeling something new. Reacting to new stimuli might also leave you feeling inspired, and able to connect to a part of yourself that has long been forgotten.</p>
<p>Sometimes trying something new can be the catalyst for other changes in your life.</p>
<h2>Work With a Therapist</h2>
<p>If you’ve tried out some of the suggestions in this article and still can’t find your way out of the rut, it may be helpful to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/08/why-working-with-a-therapist-is-different-than-talking-to-a-friend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work with a therapist</a> to help you examine what’s holding you back. Seeking support isn’t an indictment of weakness or incapability. Having an outside, professional perspective might help you get to the bottom of your “stuck-ness” and help you craft a plan to move forward.</p>
<p>In my work, I’ve often met with clients who have tried many things on their own but found themselves frustrated with their change process. Change is quite difficult! Sometimes this can lead to feelings of self-doubt and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/negative-thinking-got-you-down-heres-how-to-shift-your-thoughts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative self-talk</a> which may exacerbate ongoing mental health issues. If you have any doubt about your ability to move forward, consulting with a therapist will be insightful and help you identify and work through the barriers without judgement and self-criticism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If these past few years of political turmoil and divisiveness in America have significantly increased your stress levels, you are far from alone. Whatever your political beliefs, the current political climate in America is so divided — and downright terrifying at times — it is completely understandable to have strong feelings about it.</p>
<p>Add in the effects of a 24-hour news cycle, and the never-ending onslaught of social media, and you have a recipe for increased mental health risk.</p>
<p><span id="more-11217"></span></p>
<h2>Statistics Related to Mental Health and Politics</h2>
<p>Those who work in the mental health field can attest to this. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Therapists</a> have seen a huge spike in mental health disorders related to politics, as well as an increase in patients looking for help. In 2017, The American Psychological Association (APA), which conducts an annual “<a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stress poll</a>” saw the largest 10 year spike in stress among Americans. Of those surveyed, 57% reported stress about the political climate; 66% about our nation’s future; and 49% about the previous presidential election.</p>
<p>Americans are losing sleep, too, according to <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/personal-finance/smart-money/money-worries-survey-august-2018/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">a poll</a> from this past summer. One in seven — or 34 million of us — are suffering from politics-related insomnia. And it’s no wonder. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/05/11/hate-crime-rates-are-still-on-the-rise/?utm_term=.7fc540dce0be" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Hate crimes </a> are at a 10 year high. Many of us are worried about being able to afford health insurance now, and for the long haul. We are terrified that our basic civil rights might be stripped at any time, that we’ll be banned or deported, and that democracy as we know it might be in the toilet.</p>
<h2>Politics Are Personal</h2>
<p>Politics is deeply personal these days. Many of us have lost friendships and or had to distance ourselves or cut ties with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/when-does-family-drama-become-toxic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">family members</a> whose beliefs offend us. Racism and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/history-hysteria-sexism-diagnosis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexism</a> — even among our loved ones — feels more out in the open now. Or, we have become more aware of it. Old and new wounds have been opened, many that feel irreparable.</p>
<p>If you, like me, already had a mental health disorder (<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/anxiety-attack-vs-panic-attack-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety and panic disorder</a> in my case), you have likely needed to practice an unduly amount of self-care just to keep everything in check. Perhaps you started therapy again. Or maybe you have needed to stay out of the political arena just to make it through your days (no shame in doing what needs to be done to stay healthy and well!).</p>
<p>First of all, let’s all let out a big, cleansing, well-deserved <i>sigh</i>. It is not your imagination: Things really have been this stressful. I have never in my lifetime felt this uncertain and terrified about my country. I know so many of you are feeling that way too. <i>Group hugs all around</i>.</p>
<h2>How Voting Supports Our Mental Health</h2>
<p>But do you know what is the antidote to feeling this desperate and beaten down? VOTING! Doing something — anything — to make your feelings about what is happening in this country known is vital. It’s not only good for the future of this country, but for your mental health.</p>
<p>Part of what feels so difficult about the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/how-we-can-heal-after-this-horrible-election-cycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political times</a> is we find ourselves disempowered and helpless. Although voting won’t necessarily fix all the problems we have, it is a chance for us to make our voices heard, and to tap into a feeling of empowerment and choice.</p>
<h2>How You Can Get Involved in Political Change</h2>
<p>Besides making sure that you get yourself to the polls or get your mail-in ballot into the mailbox ASAP, there are so many other ways you can get involved this political season.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participate in a <a href="https://postcardstovoters.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">postcard mailing campaign</a>, encouraging all your fellow Americans to vote.</li>
<li>Donate what you can to political candidates whose views align with yours. Every little bit counts.</li>
<li>Ask your friends and neighbors if they are voting.</li>
<li>Offer to drive people to the polls who have no way of getting there (or alert them to the generous folks at Lyft and Uber who are offering free rides to the election).</li>
<li>Phone bank for political candidates. You can do so for candidates outside your state.</li>
<li>Sign up to do some political canvassing in your neighborhood.</li>
</ul>
<p>If that list sounds daunting to you, remember that you don’t have to do all, or any of these. But you might find that just doing one or two items spread out over the next week will feel really good.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If a friend suffers from mental illness, wanting to help or offer supportive words is understandable. Seeing someone you love in pain hurts your heart, too. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with reaching out about a friend&#8217;s mental health — but respect and delicacy is paramount. A callous or poorly thought-out comment can cause a spiral or depressive episode for someone with mental health challenges.</p>
<p>Pay attention to your words. These 12 comments might actively damage someone&#8217;s mental health — and at a minimum, they won&#8217;t help improve their well-being.</p>
<p><span id="more-11214"></span></p>
<h3>“Someone else has it worse off than you.”</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/why-successful-people-struggle-with-mental-illness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mental illness</a> doesn&#8217;t stop just because someone out there suffers more than you. We wish we could tell our brain, &#8220;Things aren&#8217;t so bad, comparatively!&#8221; Mental illness often doesn’t listen to reason. The world is dark and full of terrors, so don&#8217;t make us feel guilty about our own struggles.</p>
<h3>“You can do it! You&#8217;re so strong.”</h3>
<p>Thanks? But strength doesn&#8217;t help. Mental illness is a life-long battle, and just because we&#8217;ve knocked out the anxiety demon for the day doesn&#8217;t mean it won&#8217;t come back next week. Praising our strength now may lead to worse lows later, when our mental illness returns and we struggle to loosen its grip.</p>
<h3>“Snap out of it.”</h3>
<p>Believe us: we would if we could. But if mental illnesses disappeared with a snap of our fingers, why would <i>anyone</i> suffer? Telling us to &#8220;snap out of it&#8221; can even make our problems worse. When our mental illness doesn&#8217;t magically evaporate, we worry we&#8217;re disappointing you.</p>
<h3>“Everyone gets stressed out!”</h3>
<p>Sure, this is accurate. Everyone <i>does</i> get stressed out! But being &#8220;stressed out&#8221; is not equivalent to &#8220;having an <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/different-types-anxiety-disorders-classified/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety disorder</a>.&#8221; Mental illnesses don&#8217;t go away when midterms are over — this is something we deal with our entire life.</p>
<h3>“You&#8217;re making excuses.”</h3>
<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/">depression</a> can cause avoidance or tardiness. An anxiety attack might mean leaving a party early. We might miss a date. But the mental illness isn&#8217;t an excuse — it&#8217;s the cause, and our behavior is the symptom. Saying our anxiety or depression is an &#8220;excuse&#8221; is like saying the flu is an &#8220;excuse&#8221; for a nasty cough.</p>
<h3>“Why are you still stressed out? It happened so long ago!”</h3>
<p>Don&#8217;t dismiss the concerns of someone suffering from diagnoses like post-traumatic stress disorder by reminding them that the event in question happened &#8220;a long time ago.&#8221; Events in the distant past can loom large in our memory, meaning they don&#8217;t feel &#8220;long ago&#8221; to us.</p>
<h3>“Face your fears! You can do it!”</h3>
<p>No, we literally can&#8217;t — and frankly, it&#8217;s not that easy. We&#8217;re <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/how-irrational-fears-different/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facing our fears</a> every day. Acrophobia (or a fear of heights) won&#8217;t be miraculously cured because we decide to jump out of a plane. And <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/01/what-causes-social-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social anxiety</a> doesn&#8217;t disappear because we attended our best friend&#8217;s birthday party. If we <i>do</i> face our fears, it will be on our own terms, or with a therapist&#8217;s care and guidance.</p>
<h3>“You&#8217;re just looking for attention.”</h3>
<p>Actually, the opposite. If our mental illnesses could <i>stop</i> attracting so much attention, that would be great! Please don&#8217;t look at a friend suffering from depression and think their tears are just for show.</p>
<h3>“Chill out.”</h3>
<p>A mental illness is not a refrigerator. Believe us: We would love to relax. We&#8217;d be thrilled if we could tap our heels together three times and suddenly be less high-strung. But requesting we &#8220;chill out&#8221; might just exacerbate our spiral and lead to more stress — for everyone — in the long run.</p>
<h3>“Do you really need meds? <i>Or</i>: Maybe you need meds?”</h3>
<p>Are you a doctor? Are you <i>my</i> doctor? Clearly not, because no doctor would suggest we suddenly dump our medication. And if we&#8217;re not <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/am-i-going-to-be-on-meds-forever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taking medication</a>, please trust that we&#8217;ve fully considered the slate of options, and determined med-free is the best strategy for our specific illness. We want your support, not your unqualified medical opinions.</p>
<h3>“Have you thought about what you&#8217;re putting your family through?”</h3>
<p>All the time. Literally every day. Most people with mental illness struggle with the belief they&#8217;re <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/12/how-to-deal-with-a-family-members-mental-illness-during-the-holidays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hurting their family</a>, making this guilt trip highly effective. But if you&#8217;re hoping to help us overcome our mental illness by invoking our loved ones, think again. All you&#8217;re doing is adding weight to our burden.</p>
<h3><b>“</b>Think positively!”</h3>
<p>Yes, practicing positive thought patterns is a valuable treatment for some mental illnesses. But it&#8217;s a long process, typically undergone with a therapist&#8217;s guidance. If we could &#8220;<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/7-secrets-of-highly-resilient-people/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">think positively</a>!&#8221; on a whim, we wouldn&#8217;t have a mental illness, or could at least lessen it’s symptoms. So while your positivity may be appreciated, please keep these thoughts to yourself. Otherwise, you&#8217;re adding to the weight that mentally ill people carry every day.</p>
<h2>We’re All Working Through Something</h2>
<p>The best way to support someone working through mental health challenges is to listen, not talk. We all want what’s best for each other, and are eager to provide any solution to help ease someone’s pain. But suggesting random solutions isn’t always the answer. Sometimes all we need is to know someone cares enough about us to stand by us and understand our issues without judgement.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My husband and I spent last weekend with our families. On our way out the door from my parents’ house my mom complimented my new blazer.</p>
<p>“This thing?” I said about a blazer I had been eyeing for months, saved for, and finally splurged on after refreshing the retailer’s site 722 times over Labor Day weekend in hopes of my size restocking.</p>
<p>“It’s not that nice. It’s too heavy. And shorter than I thought it would be. And it was on sale,” I said, listing its flaws.</p>
<p><span id="more-11135"></span></p>
<p>We left and went to spend time with my in-laws, who, upon seeing me, were exceptionally congratulatory and overjoyed to chat about a new job I’ve recently started — doing exactly what I want to do, exactly where I wanted to be doing it — and wanted to know all the details.</p>
<p>“It’s not that cool, really. A job’s a job,” I bashfully said.</p>
<p>When we got in the car my husband — who has called me out on this numerous times — recounted the events and asked: “Why can’t you just take a compliment?”</p>
<h2>Why We Reactive Negatively to Compliments</h2>
<p>See, if you’re like me, a compliment induces two reactions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Option A</b>, the more likely option in my mind, is instant humiliation followed by fear that the complimenter will soon see that I am a fraud and he or she is wrong about me. I will be exposed, and <i>everything</i> will unravel from there.</li>
<li><b>Option B</b>, definitely also a viable option, stems from my distrust in the complimenter. He or she wants something from me, so I have to keep my guard up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Either way, the issue is the same. We’ve stopped seeing ourselves as worthy of admiration. We spend so much time putting ourselves down that when someone suddenly expresses an opinion that differs from our own, we’re vulnerable and suspicious.</p>
<p>This may seem strange in an era where everyone is oversharing, seemingly begging for likes and to be liked. But contrary to what <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/managing-social-media-intake-without-quitting/">social media </a>may show, many people don’t want to be acknowledged in a major way or at all. Feeling like the bright lights are shining directly on them makes some people feel like hiding.</p>
<h2><b>The Three Response Types</b></h2>
<p>Suzann and James Pawelski, authors of <a href="https://www.buildhappytogether.com/">“Happy Together: Using the Science of Positive Psychology to Build Love That Lasts”</a> seem to agree that my reaction is hardly unique. There are three distinct types of reactions to compliments.</p>
<h3>Deflection</h3>
<p>“We have found this to be a common experience of many people when receiving <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/good-mental-health-12-therapist-approved-tips/">gratitude</a>. We think part of the reason has to be cultural. We are often taught to be modest and not focus on ourselves. So that when we are given compliments we often deflect them, brushing them off like you might a crumb from your shirt or even a pesky fly,” Suzann Pawelski said.</p>
<h3>Reciprocation</h3>
<p>Suzann said that while deflection is a popular response, so is unnecessary reciprocation. “Often, before the compliment even has time to land, the other person immediately launches into his or her own expression of gratitude,” she said. Suzann and James call this the “hot potato” phenomenon.</p>
<p>“This type of response feels very transactional. It’s like we feel that if someone pays us a compliment we have to pay them back for it right away,” they say. “Again, vulnerability comes into play here. It’s natural to feel vulnerable if we find ourselves in someone’s debt. If we aren’t comfortable with it, we may try to repay — or ‘hot potato’ — the debt back as quickly as possible.”</p>
<h3>Discounting</h3>
<p>Suzann said the third type of response is discounting — this is where we give all the reasons why the compliment can’t be received.</p>
<p>For example, one time, James complimented Suzann on a great meal she had cooked. Suzann then went into a litany of all the reasons and problems why the meal wasn’t as good as it could have been — like me with my blazer. She gave a laundry list of reasons how she ran out of a certain spice, overcooked the potatoes, etc. You can imagine how James felt by the time she was done spewing her negativity! Suzann says this is an unhealthy <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/5-daily-habits-that-are-actually-hurting-your-mental-health/">habit</a> among people.</p>
<p>“It’s as if the person receiving the compliment needs to come clean and mention all the problems first before they are pointed out,” she said.</p>
<h2>Learn to Accept and Appreciate Compliments</h2>
<p>The bottom line is that while compliments should bring joy and serve as a gracious gift, they can often feel heavier to a recipient. Give thought to the recipient when you voice your compliment and consider your reaction next time you receive one. There are reasons it might not feel as good as you think it should, but you’re not alone, and noticing how you feel can help you change that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is <b>World Mental Health Day</b>, an opportunity for organizations and individuals around the globe to bring awareness to mental health and surrounding challenges.</p>
<p>Each year, the <a href="https://wfmh.global/">World Federation For Mental Health</a> (WFMH) selects a theme that facilitates discussion around a growing mental health epidemic or challenge. This year’s theme is “<strong>Young People and Mental Health in a Changing World</strong>.”</p>
<p><span id="more-11092"></span></p>
<p>As youth worldwide find themselves increasingly exposed to new methods of communication, unreal expectations from social networks, and unhealthy societal pressures as they approach full adulthood, it’s important we examine the problems new generations face.</p>
<p>Below are a few mental health challenges youth are facing around the globe, and how we all can help.</p>
<h2>Mental Illness Begins Young</h2>
<p>According to WHO, <a href="http://www.who.int/mental_health/world-mental-health-day/2018/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">half of all mental illness begins by the age of fourteen</a>. Recognizing the age at which mental illness begins is an important first step, but currently, mental illness often goes undiagnosed or untreated in this age range.</p>
<p>Youth are also susceptible to an increased suicide risk. Among 15-29-year-olds, it’s the second leading cause of death. Bullying or harassment online is increasingly common, with <a href="https://www.stopbullying.gov/cyberbullying/what-is-it/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">15% of high school students reporting they were bullied electronically</a> in 2017. Bullying leads to feelings of exclusion and rejection, which in turn lead to depression and anxiety. It’s this path that puts youth at greater risk for suicidal behavior.</p>
<p>An inability to cope with pressures from high academic expectations, entry into the workforce and its related stresses, and unstable political climates can all lead to situational substance abuse by youth. Thankfully, substance abuse overall has <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/facts-and-stats/national-and-state-data-sheets/adolescents-and-substance-abuse/united-states/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">decreased in high school students</a>.</p>
<p>Increased use of social media among younger generations leads to negative self and body image issues. These issues manifest themselves in depression and eating disorders. Instances of eating disorders among youth are <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/eating-disorders.shtml#part_155059" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">double that of adults</a>.</p>
<p>While psychotherapy and/or medication are effective solutions for working through mental illness, it’s important we also promote healthy coping behaviors in younger generations.</p>
<h2>Teaching Youth How to Cope with Tough Issues</h2>
<p>Teaching young people <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/5-therapist-approved-ways-de-stress-day/">how to combat stress</a>, and effectively manage symptoms of mental illness, leads them toward healthier, more productive lives. This has wide-ranging benefits for our societies, such as creating a happier workforce and more community-oriented individuals.</p>
<p>Concepts such as <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/self-care-stop-stress-secrets/">self-care</a> and other coping strategies are often practiced by adults, who have resources and support networks to seek help outside of traditional medical solutions. It’s important we pass these practices onto younger generations through open discussion and by sharing resources that will help them manage their <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/stress/">stress</a> and health.</p>
<p>Common examples of effective self-treatment are <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/5-ways-exercise-is-great-for-your-mental-health/">regular exercise</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/meditation-science-eases-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meditation and mindfulness practice</a>, taking <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/12-best-ways-spend-mental-health-day-according-therapist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health days</a>, and journaling. Tools like these mitigate the effects of stress and illness, and should be practiced in conjunction with therapeutic and medical solutions, if necessary.</p>
<h2>Prevention Starts at a Societal Level</h2>
<p>As global and local societies, we should do our best to stay in front of mental health risks. <a href="https://adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statistics" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Depression and anxiety disorders are reaching epidemic proportions</a>, and the effects these diagnoses have on adults trickle down to younger generations.</p>
<p>The earlier youth are exposed to healthy conversation around mental health, and provided with outlets to manage their own, the better they’ll be able to cope with issues going forward. Knowing <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/how-to-ask-for-help-mental-health-care/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">where to seek help</a>, and how to manage symptoms and stresses after diagnosis is critical to personal growth and recovery.</p>
<p>This means more resources and stigma-fighting conversations in schools. Workplaces should be prepared to help a younger workforce manage inevitable stresses. Governments should continue to provide funding to critical mental health advocacy programs and affordable health-care solutions.</p>
<p>When it comes to therapeutic options, we should teach younger generations <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/10/how-to-find-a-therapist-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to select a therapist</a> who is right for their needs, how to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/10/what-i-wish-someone-had-told-me-about-how-therapy-actually-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">communicate their issues</a> effectively, and to ensure they’re not alone in their desire to seek therapy.</p>
<h2>World Mental Health Day Is Every Day at Talkspace</h2>
<p>Treat every day as if it’s World Mental Health Day. While we’ve done incredible work to break down stigma around mental health as a society, there’s still much work to be done.</p>
<p>We should stand together each and every day to support those who are working through mental health challenges. Be there for someone if they’re struggling. Have a frank conversation with a younger person about what they’re feeling, and how you can help them. If you’re <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/09/suicide-risk-worried-about-friends-help/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concerned someone is a suicidal risk</a>, approach that person with strength but compassion.</p>
<p>Often, a simple conversation with someone you care about can save their life. Let’s continue to have those conversations together every day.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever overheard a friend or coworker declare “I’m an INFJ!” or another seemingly random four-letter combination? It’s likely they’re talking about their Myers-Briggs test results.</p>
<p>This personality-related test was developed in the 1940&#8217;s, yet continues to be discussed and applied in modern instances. Why has it become so popular over the years, and how can you take the test yourself? Answers below!</p>
<h2>What is the Myers-Briggs Test?</h2>
<p>The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a personality test, typically based on psychological attributes and is used to determine differing strengths and types of personalities in a workplace or other setting. The questionnaire’s battery of tests can provide insight into the subject’s perception, decision making, leadership skills, and other attributes may contribute to personal or professional success.</p>

<p>Myers-Briggs tests borrow from psychologist Carl Jung’s theory of dominant psychological functions: sensation, intuition, feeling, and thinking. The theory suggests that these functions color how we approach solving problems and interacting with others. Despite its origin in psychological theory, MBTI is traditionally used in business settings, but has been questioned due to its lack of scientific validity and rigor.</p>
<p>That said, Myers-Briggs continues to be used by organizations across the globe to help individuals understand and apply their personal strengths.</p>
<h2>How the Myers-Briggs Test Works</h2>
<p>The Myers-Briggs test consists of 90-plus “forced choice” questions, meaning there is only one choice when selecting between two options. The MBTI then segments subjects into 16 distinct personality types, using combinations of the following personality designations.</p>
<h3>Introvert (I) vs. Extrovert (E)</h3>
<p><b>Introverts</b> tend to consider the world from an internal perspective, allowing their ideas and creativity to flow from within themselves. Introverts tends to attach more emotional value to their thoughts and decisions.</p>
<p><b>Extroverts</b> gain their inspiration through interactions and ideation with others. This external view tends to make extroverts more collaborative.</p>
<h3>Intuitive (N) vs. Sensory (S)</h3>
<p><b>Intuitive</b> types focus more on the future by recognizing patterns and processes in order to have a greater understanding of potential results.</p>
<p><b>Sensory</b> types tend to live more in the moment and rely on holistic views through their use of immediate senses.</p>
<h3>Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F)</h3>
<p><b>Thinking</b> types take an objective approach to situations, and rely more on causal analysis and data to help form their opinions or decisions.</p>
<p><b>Feeling</b> types place considerable weight to external values as part of their decision making, giving more emphasis to the subjective aspects of a situation, and considering personal differences.</p>
<h3>Perceiving (P) vs. Judging (J)</h3>
<p><b>Perceiving</b> types go with the flow, and enjoy flexibility and spontaneity when it comes to agendas or decisions.</p>
<p><b>Judging </b>types take an organized approach to life, and prefer that events be planned out or scheduled in order to go as smoothly as possible.</p>
<h3>Example Test Outcomes</h3>
<p>After the questionnaire is completed, the testee is assigned a four-letter code to help explain their personality type.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re an “INFJ” type, this means you’re highest on the scales for introversion, intuition, feeling, and judging. In combination these qualities mean you’re likely a private, organized, and process-driven person who considers the emotions of others as part of your decision making.</p>
<h2>How to take the Myers-Briggs Test</h2>
<p>There are a few ways to take the Myers-Briggs test, both officially and unofficially.</p>
<h3>The official test</h3>
<p>The official Myers-Briggs personality assessment test is available on the MBTI website here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mbtionline.com/TaketheMBTI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Take the MBTI Test</a></p>
<p>The test requires a one-time fee of $49.95 and includes a downloadable report, an interactive learning session, and other tips and tools related to your results.</p>
<h3>Alternative tests</h3>
<p>There are other unofficial tests that mirror the Myers-Briggs’s intent, but provide results using their own terminology or qualifications. They often refer to themselves as “type-finders” or “personality tests.” Here are some options that may give you similar results to MBTI:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">16Personalities NERIS Type Explorer®</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.truity.com/test/type-finder-research-edition" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Truity’s TypeFinder®</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Humanmetrics Jung Typology Test<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></p>
<p>These tests are free, but their results may vary from the official MBTI designations. If you’re looking for a by the books Myers-Briggs assessment, you may want to consider the official test.</p>
<h2>Should I Trust Myers-Briggs as a Personality Test?</h2>
<p>There are many in both camps who can speak to the positive and negative attributes of the Myers-Briggs test. Quite simply, it’s an assessment to help us understand our personalities at a high level. Its results, however, have no scientific basis and are entirely open to personal interpretation.</p>
<p>If anything, the Myers-Briggs test gives us a surface-level understanding of our strengths and weaknesses. When compared to other’s results, it can reveal potential conflicts, or explain personality clashes. Again this isn’t based on rigorous scientific understanding and methods, but rather a theory of personality differences.</p>
<p>The Myers-Briggs test shouldn’t necessarily be taken to gain insight into the state of our mental health. Nor is it meant to serve as proof of our flaws. For this reason, therapists don’t administer the test as part of psychotherapy, nor does the therapist community give much credence to its results.</p>
<h2>Looking to Truly Learn More About Yourself?</h2>
<p>One way to understand and discuss personality traits is to talk with a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">therapist</a>. While personality tests shed light on how we respond to different situations, therapists can give you concrete tools and exercises to apply to your life and help improve traits you feel may be holding you back.</p>
<p>Most importantly, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">therapy</a> teaches you not to judge yourself on the surface, or tie who you truly are to the results of a 90 question test. We’re humans, not four-letter acronyms, and we deserve to be considered in the full context of our uniqueness.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bloating. Headaches. Moodiness. These symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) are well known, likely because more than<a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/menstrual-cycle/premenstrual-syndrome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> 90 percent of women</a> experience at least one symptom before their monthly cycle. But for some women, the symptoms go beyond minor discomfort and a feeling of being off.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell everybody, &#8216;I&#8217;m not myself right now. I&#8217;ll call you back when I&#8217;m Ronna again,&#8221; one woman was quoted as saying on<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/10/22/223805027/should-disabling-premenstrual-symptoms-be-a-mental-disorder" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> National Public Radio</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-10790"></span></p>
<p>Ronna, like<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/9132-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder-pmdd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> three to five percent</a> of menstruating women, suffers from premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a severe, often disabling extension of PMS. How is it different?<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/premenstrual-syndrome/expert-answers/pmdd/faq-20058315" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> According to the Mayo Clinic</a>, women with PMDD usually battle at least one prominent emotional and behavioral symptom:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sadness or hopelessness</li>
<li><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">Anxiety</a> or tension</li>
<li>Extreme moodiness</li>
<li>Marked irritability or anger</li>
</ul>
<p>While often viewed as a primarily physical experience, PMS and the more severe PMDD prove that your periods each month can have an impact on your mental health. Here’s why.</p>
<h2>The Hormonal Link Between PMS, PMDD, and Mental Health</h2>
<p>For both PMS and PMDD, the exact cause is unknown, but most researchers agree that PMDD is related to the hormonal changes that correspond with the menstrual cycle. According to the<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/9132-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder-pmdd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Cleveland Clinic</a>, studies have shown a connection between PMDD and low levels of serotonin, a chemical in the brain that helps transmit nerve signals. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/ways-stomach-microbiome-impacts-mental-health/" target="_blank">Changes in serotonin levels</a> can contribute to PMDD systems since serotonin helps control mood, sleep, and pain.</p>
<p>While underlying depression and anxiety are common in both PMS and PMDD, the hormonal changes that trigger a menstrual period can worsen the symptoms of mood disorders. Relationships can suffer from the emotional symptoms of depression, anxiety, and irritability, leading to additional stressors on mental and emotional health.</p>
<h2>How These Symptoms Mimic Depression</h2>
<p>Intricately woven into the current state of your mental health, PMDD symptoms mimic those of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/what-is-crippling-depression/">major depression</a>. This means that women suffering from PMDD also take on the risks of major depression, like an increased risk of suicide during the two weeks they are affected. For women who have a personal or family history of mood disorders — including major depression or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/postpartum-depression-a-quick-guide-for-tired-new-moms/" target="_blank">postpartum depression</a> — they’re at a greater risk for developing PMDD to begin with. Unlike major depression, however, PMDD symptoms lessen or go away at the start of your period.</p>
<p>The reverse effect is also true. Mental health conditions in general<a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health/living-mental-health-condition/reproductive-health-and-mental-health" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> can cause period problems</a> or make some period problems worse. Studies show that women with anxiety disorder or substance use disorder are more likely to have shorter menstrual cycles. Irregular cycles are also linked to eating disorders and depression, and women with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/knew-bipolar-disorder-not-depression/" target="_blank">bipolar disorder</a> are twice as likely to have irregular periods.</p>
<h2>Genetic and Environmental Risk Factors</h2>
<p>Some women may be more at risk than others, with physicians considering both environmental and genetic<a href="https://psychcentral.com/blog/pmdd-is-not-just-normal-moodiness/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> risk factors</a> during the diagnostic process. Stress, a history of interpersonal trauma, seasonal changes, and socio-cultural aspects can impact the development of PMDD. It’s unknown if PMDD is hereditary, but PMS symptoms are: 30 to 80 percent of women who suffer from PMS indicate that other women in their family suffer, as well.</p>
<p>A<a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/psych/wmd/mood-disorders/menstrually-related" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> large percentage of women</a> seeking treatment for PMDD — 40 percent — actually have an underlying mood disorder, so it’s important to undergo a careful evaluation to ensure you receive the best treatment.</p>
<h2>A Recognized Disorder</h2>
<p>Just like other mental health disorders,<a href="https://womensmentalhealth.org/specialty-clinics/pms-and-pmdd/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> there’s hope for women</a> experiencing PMDD. Lifestyle modifications like eliminating caffeine and sugar, decreasing alcohol use, and getting enough sleep can help address the symptoms.</p>
<p><a href="https://womensmentalhealth.org/posts/nutritional-supplements-for-premenstrual-syndrome-do-they-work/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nutritional supplements</a> like Vitamin B6 can help women with PMS, while some evidence points to the effectiveness of magnesium and Vitamin E. Herbal therapies and light therapy represent two other options with psychotherapy and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-how-is-it-conducted-online/" target="_blank">Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</a> also offering a non-pharmacologic approach to treatment.</p>
<p>Medications ranging from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to benzodiazepines and hormonal interventions may also be effective options.</p>
<p>There’s more good news for these women. After<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/millennial-media/201202/the-inclusion-pmdd-in-dsm-5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> years of petitioning</a> by researchers and advocates, PMDD is now included in the latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). As a<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3462360/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> new category</a>, this provide greater legitimacy for the disorder, which will hopefully lead to new research and treatments based on a recognized connection between periods and mental health.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even if you haven’t heard the term “energy vampire” before, you’ve surely experienced the phenomenon. You know that exhausted, worn out feeling you get after being with someone who just emotionally drains you? Yep, that’s an energy vampire in action, sucking out all your good vibes, leaving you frustrated and tired.</p>
<p><span id="more-10457"></span></p>
<p>The bad news is that keeping garlic around isn’t going to be enough to ward off this type of vampire. Instead, you will have to be proactive in protecting yourself, which begins with identifying the perpetrator. Energy vampires and their soul-sucking behaviors come in many different forms. Some examples are those who <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/why-gossip-seductive-how-to-avoid-it/">love to gossip</a> and start drama, who are extremely self-deprecating, or those who simply never have anything positive to say.</p>
<p>Energy vampires aren’t necessarily bad people, and we’ve probably all been in their shoes at one point. Some people simply don’t know how to cope with their own problems, and a lot of the time, they might not have a clue that their behavior is impacting you negatively. This is why it’s crucial to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/guide-setting-healthy-boundaries-relationships/" target="_blank">set boundaries</a> with energy vampires, so their negative impact on you is minimal.</p>
<h2>6 Tips for Setting Boundaries with Energy Vampires</h2>
<h3>1. Listen to your body</h3>
<p>After spending time with an energy vampire, your body may give you clues, like feeling fatigued. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">Talkspace therapist</a> Cynthia Catchings, LCSW-S, shares, “My top tip for setting boundaries with energy vampires is to educate ourselves to recognize the signs; our body is usually trying to tell us something and we have to learn to listen.”</p>
<p>This way, the next time you come in contact with someone with energy-sucking tendencies, you’ll know what’s going on and you’ll be prepared to take the next steps.</p>
<h3>2. Remember that you are in control</h3>
<p>While it may not feel like it, you are, in fact, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/control-emotions-cognitive-behavioral-therapy/" target="_blank">the one in control</a> in these situations. The power to feel better is in your hands.</p>
<p>“Keeping these vampires in your life will be more detrimental to your physical and mental health,” Catchings says, “You have the power to let them go and live a happy life.”</p>
<p>It’s up to you whether or not you want to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/signs-youre-in-a-toxic-relationship/" target="_blank">continue a relationship</a> with an energy vampire. You aren’t doomed to having your energy drained forever if you’re willing to make a change.</p>
<h3>3. Be straightforward and non-confrontational</h3>
<p>Being straightforward is the best way to speak to an energy vampire, according to Talkspace therapist Rachel O’Neil, Ph.D.</p>
<p>“Work on being straightforward. Explain how their behavior has impacted your well-being,” O’Neill says, “At the same time, reinforce that you value your relationship with them and are committed to maintaining a relationship. These conversations tend to work best when you’re not at a high emotional level and can express your feelings in a non-confrontational way.”</p>
<p>You can write out some talking points, or practice with someone you trust beforehand, so you’ll feel more prepared and less emotional.</p>
<h3>4. Take a break</h3>
<p>“Breaks” aren’t just for <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/guide-setting-healthy-boundaries-relationships/" target="_blank">romantic relationships</a>. You might need to take a step away from someone to assess your relationship and to notice how different you feel when you’ve distanced yourself.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, a simple break from the person can help you to feel better equipped to deal with them,” O’Neil advises, “If that still doesn’t work and they don’t seem committed to changing their behavior, then you may have to make some long term adjustments.”</p>
<h3>5. Know when to cut someone out completely</h3>
<p>For better or worse, we can’t change people. However, we can change the way we interact with them. You have to weigh the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/types-friends-bad-mental-health/" target="_blank">pros and cons of the relationship</a>, and be ready to walk away if necessary. If your situation isn’t improving even after some straightforward communication, you might need to take some more drastic steps.</p>
<p>“If you’ve tried to talk with them about their behavior and they aren’t receptive to feedback or lapse back into their old ways, then perhaps it’s time to re-evaluate your relationship with them,” O’Neil states.</p>
<h3>6. Don’t feel guilty for setting boundaries</h3>
<p>Don’t confuse setting boundaries for being cruel. Setting boundaries doesn’t make you a mean person! Remember, you ultimately need to do what is best for you and your mental health, and that’s nothing to feel guilty about.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, people can feel guilty or upset about having to set boundaries. It’s okay to feel this way but it’s important to still be firm in the boundaries you set,” O’Neil urges.</p>
<h2>Remember, You’re In Control</h2>
<p>In the end, you control how much energy that energy vampires suck out of you. You need positive energy and strength to be your best self and get through life — so don’t give others the power to take it away from you.</p>
<p>Learning to say no and set boundaries will ultimately make you a much stronger person, and there’s no better time to start than now.</p>
