				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When someone has wronged you in some way, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/why-feeling-anger-is-good-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anger</a> is a natural reaction. If what happened is especially painful — or if the person who hurt you is unwilling to take responsibility — you may start to form a grudge against that person.</p>
<p>Many of us hold grudges for a limited time, and are able to let them go after some healthy processing. Others hold onto them for years, and may even have grudges stemming from their childhood. Most of us will only hold grudges against a few select people; others seem to collect grudges readily and with vigor.<span id="more-11418"></span></p>
<p>However they play out for you — and even if you don’t think of yourself as a “grudge-holding person” — almost all of us have held a grudge at some point or another. Holding grudges is a very common human behavior, but it can be unhealthy in the long-term. Here’s why.</p>
<h2>The Problem With Holding Grudges</h2>
<p>Having a grudge here or there isn’t necessarily abnormal or even problematic. The problem is that, sometimes, grudges can take on a life of their own.</p>
<p>Grudge holding can be a cyclical pattern — and once we get sucked in, it can be hard to find out way out.</p>
<p>“People often get stuck in the cycle of holding grudges because they expect something from someone and that expectation hasn’t been fulfilled,” says Rachel O’Neill, Ph.D., a licensed professional clinical <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/mental-health-counselor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">counselor</a> in Ohio and a Talkspace provider.</p>
<p>For example, you might feel that someone has wronged you in some way. Let’s say the person has attempted an apology or taken responsibility in some way, but you don’t find this acceptable or sufficient. When something like this happens, says O’Neill, “grudges can deepen and individuals can feel more entrenched in feelings of resentment or bitterness toward the person.”</p>
<p>Of course, the more angry and bitter you are toward someone, the harder it becomes to work through any issues you have with them. Grudges can easily spiral into a never-ending cycle of blame and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/anger-emotions-run-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rage</a>, which is why it’s important to work toward resolution internally, or with the other party..</p>
<h2>Are There Any Benefits To Holding Grudges?</h2>
<p>Clearly, holding grudges isn’t beneficial for anyone in the long run. But are there situations where holding a grudge is justified?</p>
<p>There’s no denying there are people in our lives who act in toxic ways. Often there is no good way to remedy these situations without <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/11/fighting-style-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conflict</a>; and some of the people who have hurt us seem incapable of authentic apologies.</p>
<p>So perhaps there are ways that grudges can act as a healthy coping mechanism. Maybe holding a grudge against someone who has behaved in a harmful way could serve as a wake-up call to them that their behavior will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>There may be some truth to that, but it can only go so far, says O’Neill. “I think grudges can be healthy in the sense that they can represent an invitation to examine your feelings toward someone,” she says.</p>
<p>However, even if holding a grudge against someone can be enlightening and even empowering at times, dwelling in a place of anger and resentment doesn’t help you grow or live a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/what-is-happiness-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happier</a> life.</p>
<h2>How Do Grudges Affect Our Mental Health?</h2>
<p>Holding grudges can be just as damaging to the grudge-holder as the person who the grudge is being held against.</p>
<p>Holding a grudge means that you are living with a feeling of anger almost constantly, even if it’s below the surface. Sure, you may not be thinking about the grudge 24 hours a day, but this sort of resentment can find its way into all aspects of your life. It can be easy to start seeing everyone you meet as someone who has the potential to wrong you.</p>
<p>There are psychological conditions that can result from excessive grudge-holding, according to O’Neill. When you can end up “stuck” in a grudge, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a>, heightened <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/stress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stress</a>, or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depression</a> are common conditions that can manifest, she explains.</p>
<h2>What Are Some Ways To Let Grudges Go?</h2>
<p>Letting go of grudges doesn’t necessarily mean resolving a particular problem you have with a person. Obviously, having constructive conversations with someone who has upset you — and hopefully coming up with a resolution that feels good for both parties involved — is a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/how-setting-micro-goals-can-increase-happiness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goal</a>. But sometimes things will remain unresolved, and that hurt can linger.</p>
<p>In this case, rather than getting stuck with anger about what happened, we need to learn to take responsibility for our own feelings about the situation. Grudges can be seen as an opportunity to learn that “instead of being dependent on someone else to fix your feelings for you, you’re able to fulfill that need for yourself,” O’Neill says.</p>
<p>Perhaps then there is a positive to holding grudges.</p>
<p>If we can get past the feeling of resentment, maybe there is a real chance for self-growth. It’s an opportunity for us to to accept things for what they are, live more completely in the present, practice some serious self-love — and most of all, learn the fine art of letting go.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being the friend or loved one of someone with a mental illness can be emotionally difficult. While you wish to remain open, objective and compassionate, sometimes your reserves of patience become too drained and make it difficult to maintain a reciprocal relationship. You may even begin to feel taken advantage of.</p>
<p>You may feel guilty for being angry at someone who is suffering. But, if you’re wondering if you can feel both compassion and anger at someone suffering from a mental illness, the answer is yes. Here are some steps to help you through these difficult and conflicting feelings.</p>
<p><span id="more-11150"></span></p>
<h2><b>Work Through Emotions</b></h2>
<p>Understand that you’re a human being experiencing human reactions. Do what you need in order to remember who you are as an individual, and channel your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/control-emotions-cognitive-behavioral-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emotions</a> in healthy ways, such as by finding a new hobby.</p>
<p>Try to remember that, normally, a person with a mental illness doesn&#8217;t <i>intend</i> to direct inappropriate behavior or statements at you. They <a href="https://ie.reachout.com/mental-health-problems/supporting-someone-with-a-mental-illness/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">may not correctly interpret how you’re feeling</a>, either.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/anger-emotions-run-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anger</a> build up inside of you and result in resentment or outbursts. You need to find firm ground inside and outside of yourself. If you decide to stay in this person’s life, it is important to take things in stride and establish your own methods of handling any dysfunctional behavioral patterns.</p>
<h2><b>Establish a Plan</b></h2>
<p>Feeling stuck? Make a plan for how you will assist, cope and stay balanced. Set clear directives for how you&#8217;re willing to help and when. Define how you take care of yourself, and schedule that time. Your job is not to fix a person — but you can help them along. Offer compassion through <a href="https://hside.org/6-ways-to-support-a-friend-with-a-mental-illness/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">space and active listening and learning</a>, but also establish clear boundaries.</p>
<p>You want to be there for your loved one, but sometimes for your health and safety, you can reach a point where you have to weigh how they’re affecting your life. Ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are they making efforts to improve their condition?</li>
<li>Does this sufferer’s behavior threaten your health or livelihood?</li>
<li>Can you accept the sufferer as they are, or do you want them to change?</li>
<li>What do you need?</li>
<li>What do they need, and where do you fit in?</li>
</ul>
<p>Mental health conditions ebb and flow, but many possibilities for management and treatment exist. You can&#8217;t change someone. Only they can change themselves. There&#8217;s a limit to what&#8217;s reasonable for a person to handle.</p>
<p>Based on an analysis of 37 research studies, between <a href="http://davidsusman.com/2015/06/11/8-reasons-why-people-dont-get-mental-health-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">30 to 80 percent of people don&#8217;t pursue treatment</a> for their mental illness due to feelings like fear and inadequacy. Mental health conditions can be serious, and someone who doesn&#8217;t make an effort to get better can have a serious impact on your quality of life. You may decide to end a relationship when the person:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is dangerous, stalking or abusing you</li>
<li>Becomes reckless</li>
<li>Projects blame onto you for their problems</li>
<li>Neglects and avoids treatment consciously</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have other reasons beyond these, and those reasons might be valid too. If you feel unsafe, take the steps you need to feel safe again. <a href="http://victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/stalking-resource-center/help-for-victims" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Contact a victim advocate</a> for guidance escaping from the situation. Trust your instincts, and document your journey.</p>

<h2><b>Build a Support Network</b></h2>
<p>People often forget themselves when their energy and efforts get directed to the health of a loved one. You sleep and breathe their condition, wanting to understand it and them better. You see the person. Do you see yourself?</p>
<p>It is important to make the loved ones in your life feel appreciated. Spend quality time together, and ask for validation, support and even time away when you need it.</p>
<p>Next, build your support network of friends, family, support groups, advocates and counselors. Yes, it&#8217;s okay to get a therapist or counselor for yourself. They can provide you with the tools required for self-growth, emotional regulation, and communication.</p>
<h2><b>Establish Self-Care Routines</b></h2>
<p>How do you support yourself? What are your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/self-care-stop-stress-secrets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-care</a> routines? You need to exercise self-care in your personal routines and maintain these practices every day. Keep a regular schedule. Eat healthy, with multiple colorful food groups represented on your plate. Make your bedroom comfortable so that you can get enough sleep and sleep well.</p>
<p>Exercise at least <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320760.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">30 minutes each day</a> to boost your mood and overall health. Moderate levels of aerobic exercise like jogging, swimming, dance, brisk walking or tennis will do the trick. Find what works for you.</p>
<p>Most sufferers get better over time with treatment as they develop more confidence and coping mechanisms. Anger can come with compassion when you&#8217;re a support person, but you also need to honor yourself and your health. Do what you can to support them, but don’t feel bad about your own feelings — they are valid and are meant to be felt and worked through.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I became self-aware of my anger in my early 20s after I was diagnosed as bipolar. Shortly after my diagnosis, I was at a bar with some friends and an ex-boyfriend showed up with his new girlfriend. Some words were said and instead of walking away to cool off, I threw myself at her and wrapped my fingers around her throat. Two bouncers pulled me off and frog-marched me to the door. Even though I clearly had been drinking, I got into my car and sped off to a friend’s house. I crashed on their couch and drove home sober early the following morning.</p>
<p>I marveled later that I was not pulled over for drunk driving and, had I been, how much my life would have changed. I marveled that assault charges were never filed against me. I also marveled at how my anger may have become my new normal.</p>
<p>It was a wake-up call. Something had to change, but the actual change wouldn’t come until much later.<span id="more-6012"></span></p>
<p>Today, I call it “flipping table syndrome.”</p>
<p>Often, and without warning, I can go from a fairly moderate, stable mood to all out rage. Sometimes there is a trigger, but often that trigger is benign: someone says something I don’t like (typically online); I get frustrated with something I am working on; the list goes on. Other times I wake up in such a rage state, I need to remove myself from most human interactions for that day. Sometimes my anger subsides within a few hours, other times it takes a few days to calm down.</p>
<p>Knowing I am capable of physical anger, I try to keep myself in check, but there have been a few times where I have failed. Past journal entries tell stories of having hit and scratched ex-boyfriends. I once pushed my brother through a door. I have been extremely lucky I’ve never been hit back, though, to be honest, I would have felt — at the time — I deserved it.</p>
<p>I once dated someone who was also mentally ill and also had anger issues. He pushed me into a claw foot tub. I ordered him out of my apartment and I left the relationship that day. But even knowing enough to end an abusive relationship, I secretly felt I had deserved his wrath after a long history of being physical with people when I was angry.</p>
<p>My anger isn’t just about hitting or being physical, sometimes it manifests itself in other ways. There are times when I berate people for what I consider a slight or when I believe they are in the wrong. I always seem to jump to quick conclusions, a method my <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a> calls “crystal balling,” and, not unsurprisingly, I come to understand later that I am almost always wrong.</p>
<p>Sometimes I am frightened and instead of working out what frightens me, I lash out. I have no sense of personal boundaries. There have been times where I have been disruptive because I need attention and not getting it makes me even angrier. I am also very aggressive — so much so it is not unusual for someone to tell me they are scared of me.</p>
<p>When I am angry, my breathing becomes erratic and my teeth hurt from grinding. Being calm and rational takes a back seat. When I eventually calm down there is always remorse and always the huge sense of guilt.</p>
<p>I have worked hard to control my anger. I have gone through anger management classes when I was unmedicated, which helped to an extent. But managing a chemical imbalance without medications can only go so far. When I did eventually get medicated, my anger started to lessen. The physical aspect has subsided almost entirely. I now see the anger coming, whereas before it would flip without notice.</p>
<p>I tell my husband and those I encounter that I feel myself getting angry, that I need to step away so I’m not a jerk. That “stepping away” typically means using <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/finding-inner-peace-mindfulness-5-senses/" target="_blank">soothing techniques</a> such as meditation, reading, knitting, or taking walks. It is true what they say — exercise is a great boost in helping those who are mentally ill and my long daily walks have helped tremendously.</p>
<p>But it’s not always perfect. I have to work hard to repair <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/relationships/" target="_blank">relationships</a> that were damaged by my anger as well as work to prevent myself from creating new problems for myself. I have to remind myself this is not me but my disease. I have to remind myself that I have a support network of people who are aware of my anger, know my outbursts are not personal attacks upon them, and how to work with me if I start to get out of control. I know this is something I will have to manage for the rest of my life. Instead of being frightened of my past behavior, I use it as a tool to help forge a better future.</p>
