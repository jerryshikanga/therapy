				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unfortunate situations are often called setbacks for a good reason: they set you back from your carefully planned life trajectory. For many of us, losing a pet, failing on a work project, or experiencing a harsh rejection can feel like the end of the world.</p>
<p>For some lucky people, these problems don’t seem permanent. Sure, they might feel sad, and yes, even a little disappointment. But they&#8217;re resilient: able to bounce back quickly, even from the most serious setbacks. This ability isn&#8217;t magic — it&#8217;s resiliency, and you can experience it too. Cultivate this life-changing trait by practicing these seven simple habits.</p>
<p><span id="more-9636"></span></p>
<h2>Positive Thoughts Make a Positive Mood</h2>
<p>A bad day can leave you down in the dumps for weeks. But some people just bounce back from a setback — no matter its severity. Here&#8217;s the secret: they&#8217;re thinking positively. Reframing your thoughts might sound like a struggle, but optimism comes easier if you <a href="https://www.berkeleywellbeing.com/positive-reappraisal-activity.html" target="_blank">practice positive reappraisal</a>.</p>
<p>Imagine a frustrating situation, like being laid off from your job. It&#8217;s easy to turn this into a huge negative. You lost your job! &#8220;Upset&#8221; is a natural reaction. Positive reappraisal challenges you to find exciting opportunities, even in a downturn. You lost your job,and now you have time to pursue your dream of running your own Etsy shop. Or you can work on that novel you&#8217;ve been dreaming about.</p>
<p>Science show that positivity breeds positivity: The <a href="https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/broaden-build-theory/" target="_blank">broaden-and-build theory</a> indicates that looking at the world through rose-colored glasses might bring you more joy.</p>
<h2>(But You Need to Think Positively All the Time)</h2>
<p>Positive thinking has to extend to your day-to-day in order to strengthen your ability to rebound. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3132556/" target="_blank">Researchers have found</a> that &#8220;infusing ordinary events with positive meaning&#8221; can directly affect your resiliency.</p>
<p>What does that mean? <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/finding-inner-peace-mindfulness-5-senses/" target="_blank">Be mindful</a>. Take time to be grateful for your circumstances,and not simply when things are going well. Spend part of every day appreciating ordinary moments and you might just find your ability to appreciate the less-than-ordinary (even when it&#8217;s bad) is much-improved.</p>
<h2>Good Friends Improve Sad Days</h2>
<p>Somehow, moping feels better when you&#8217;re alone. Add a glass of wine, an indulgent dinner, and a too-long TV binging session and you&#8217;ve fallen into a classic case of emotional coping. Dealing with your emotions can reduce your stress, but it won&#8217;t improve your resiliency in the long run.</p>
<p>Instead, build up a good support system. Resilient people don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out to family and friends after setbacks — in fact, an extensive social network can actually <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2921311/" target="_blank">increase your ability</a> to fight off stress. Relax by sharing your struggles with your friends, and you might just find yourself bouncing back quicker.</p>
<h2>Self-Awareness Breeds Resiliency</h2>
<p>Falling into a negative black hole is far too easy when you&#8217;re unaware of your own pitfalls. In an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2017/jun/09/how-to-resilient-self-awareness-mindfulness-support-experts" target="_blank">interview with The Guardian</a>, University of Bedfordshire occupational health psychologist Gail Kinman said that her research has found that &#8220;self-awareness is an important aspect of resilience—in fact, it is fundamental.&#8221;</p>
<p>Think about a typical bad day. Your boss yells at you. The coffee maker breaks (and spills all over your shirt). Your presentation goes up in flames. And your dog eats a huge chunk of chocolate… the chocolate you&#8217;ve been saving for a bad day just like this. Before you know it, you&#8217;re skipping the gym, acting rude to your partner, and completely uninterested in playing with your pup.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/02/self-awareness-will-make-your-life-better-heres-how-to-get-it/">Cultivating self-awareness</a> means you can cut off the negative cycle at its root, before it grows into a major problem. You&#8217;ll be able to recognize your poor coping skills immediately — like that desperate urge to skip the gym — and fight back.</p>
<h2>Directly Addressing Problems Makes Things Simpler</h2>
<p>Some setbacks can&#8217;t be solved — the death of a beloved family member or the loss of a job, for example. But these major complications have solutions. Resilient people use problem-focused coping methods, identifying the root cause of the stressor and seeking to solve that problem. This takes active planning: thinking about how the situation could be solved or prevented in the future and developing goals and a plan that can prevent or mediate the hiccup.</p>
<h2>Taking Time to Recharge</h2>
<p>Resiliency isn&#8217;t merely the ability to persevere through endless mud. Resilient people share one important trait: they&#8217;re good at recharging when their emotional battery is low. A continual series of tough days with no break is sure to deplete your energy and willpower.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/how-to-be-resilient-the-art-of-the-bounceback/" target="_blank">A strong reserve of willpower is necessary for bouncing back</a>. Otherwise, you might find yourself cracking like an egg. Remember that bad-day routine? Forcing yourself to go to the gym can feel impossible if your whole life is a slog. Set aside time to relax in order to ensure you&#8217;ll recover from your next major setback.</p>
<h2>Facing Your Fears</h2>
<p>Every disruption might feel like the end of the world unless you start dealing directly with your fears. Perhaps you&#8217;re terrified of looking foolish or incompetent in front of your peers. So, to avoid this horrible feeling, you&#8217;re always avoiding huge projects where you might fail. That might feel fine — as long as it works.</p>
<p>But facing those fears doesn&#8217;t only lead to a better, more exciting and successful life. It can also help you gain resiliency. When you <a href="https://www.emotionallyresilientliving.com/is-fear-causing-you-to-lead-a-smaller-life" target="_blank">already know what it&#8217;s like to be scared</a>, dealing with a setback or problem feels much simpler.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At some point in your life, something bad is bound to happen to you. This isn’t pessimism, this is realism. Take a second to think about all the less than ideal things that can possibly happen in life. You might get laid off. You might experience a natural disaster. You might fall very ill. You’re more than likely to experience a break up, or have someone around you die.</p>
<p>Life is a series of ups and downs, and this is a fact we can’t change. What we can change, though, is how we react to the negative situations which arise, and perhaps even more importantly, how we bounce back. Let’s talk about resilience.</p>
<p><span id="more-9376"></span></p>
<h2>Resilience and Mental Health</h2>
<p>Merriam Webster’s definition of resilience is “an ability to recover from or adjust easily to misfortune or change.” Pretty straightforward, right? For a more psychological definition, I spoke to Jill Daino, LCSW. Her definition of being resilient is, “having the capacity to recover from adversity.” Luckily, she believes this important skill is one that each and every one of us can develop.</p>
<p>“Given that everyone experiences challenges in life that can be overwhelming — natural disasters, interpersonal trauma, significant financial stressors, and a variety of other life events — the ability to recover and move through the pain that is associated with these events is a vital part of life,” Daino said.</p>
<p>Being resilient is absolutely crucial to maintaining good mental health. While it’s totally okay to feel sad sometimes and experience emotional pain, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/negative-thinking-got-you-down-heres-how-to-shift-your-thoughts/" target="_blank">we don’t want to mope and dwell on horrible experiences forever</a>. Daino adds, “Being resilient and tapping into the capacity to ‘bounce back’ after a difficult, painful, possibly overwhelming experience enables us to rebuild our life and emotional reserves — and oftentimes significant growth occurs and strengthens us for the future.”</p>
<p>Here are some tips on how to be resilient as a rubber band.</p>
<h2>Tips to Remain Resilient</h2>
<h3>Be kind to yourself</h3>
<p>Nurture yourself while you find the time to heal and bounce back. It&#8217;s not a one size fits all process. Some people are more resilient than others, and being less resilient doesn’t make you a lesser person. Once you have bounced back from a tragedy, it&#8217;s normal and inevitable to revisit the event and the feelings associated with it.</p>
<p>Don’t beat yourself up for having a bad day, for crying, or for being anxious. Allow yourself to feel. Holding in emotions does the soul no good. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/therapy-start-working/" target="_blank">The healing process is not the same for everyone</a>, and we should avoid comparing our own healing process to somebody else’s. Show yourself some love!</p>
<h3><b>Ask for help</b></h3>
<p>“If someone is struggling after something bad has happened the first thing they should know is they are not alone,” Daino advises, “Help is readily available, and they can get the support they need to recover. Many people think they need to figure things out on their own.”</p>
<p>“They don’t want to burden family or friends,” she said, “yet reaching out for support at these difficult times can make a significant difference in life. It is a sign of strength to know when we need help and be able to ask for it.”</p>
<h3>Don’t isolate yourself</h3>
<p>Humans are social creatures, and while it&#8217;s all too easy to isolate yourself when you&#8217;re hurting, being around others is a great tool for healing and can make a significant difference. Friends and family can create a nurturing safe space.</p>
<p>“Human beings are amazingly resilient and capable,” Daino explains, “Having a safe space to discuss what has gone on while also being able to strategize how to rebuild and recover is invaluable. While feeling better doesn’t happen overnight, it is possible.”</p>
<h3>Be flexible</h3>
<p>If you’re the type of person who has your whole life planned out in specific detail, you are going to need to be flexible after facing a hardship. You’ll have to realize that life may have just created a new path for you, and you’re going to have to roll with it.</p>
<p>If you’re an optimist (or even if you’re not) you can go with the whole, “everything happens for a reason” belief. Be introspective and be flexible in figuring out what’s next. What door opened after another just closed?</p>
<h3>Practice Self Care</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/7-self-care-tips-for-when-stress-affects-your-body/" target="_blank">Self-care is something you should always do</a>, but definitely kick it up a notch when times are rough. Experiment with different activities to see which make you feel best both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>Take a bath, treat yourself to a massage, go for a run, or meditate. Writing in a journal or creating art can be especially cathartic and help you to release your emotions.</p>
<h2>Practice resilience over inaction</h2>
<p>So next time you’re experiencing a hardship (or maybe you are right now), keep those tips in mind. Even following just one of them can help you bounce back. Soon enough, you’ll be feeling like yourself again, and you’ll be stronger and ready for the next thing life throws at you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re familiar with 1999 pop punk hit “My Own Worst Enemy” by Lit, then you’re familiar with the phenomenon of self-sabotage. If you’re not, allow me to give you a modern rock lesson and an excellent example of a self-sabotaging protagonist&#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-9121"></span></p>
<p>The first verse goes:</p>
<p><em>“It&#8217;s no surprise to me I am my own worst enemy / &#8216;Cause every now and then I kick the living s*** out of me /The smoke alarm is going off, and there&#8217;s a cigarette still burning&#8230;”</em></p>
<p>The singer has made a habit of putting himself down, falling prey to unhealthy habits which destroy his relationship. He keeps up with these behaviors despite warning signs and negative outcomes.</p>
<p>When we don’t get what we want, it’s easy to put the blame on external forces — but if you look back and reflect on your own behaviors, you may realize you played a part in the downfall of one of your plans. You could even say that you <em>sabotaged</em> it!</p>
<p>Here are some ways you might be self-sabotaging (consciously or unconsciously) everyday, and more importantly, how to stop.</p>
<h2>1. You jump ship when a relationship starts to get serious.</h2>
<p>There are loads of ways you can try to ruin your own relationship, but usually one underlying cause: you don’t want to get hurt. Right before you get in deep with your partner, you may find yourself picking fights or being extra nitpicky about them. Why? Perhaps because deep down you’d rather end the relationship then and there than proceed to become more vulnerable and get hurt like you have in past romances.</p>
<h2>How to Stop:</h2>
<p>Remember: While relationships may have similar patterns, no two are exactly the same, and there are <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/7-relationship-myths-debunked-by-a-therapist/" target="_blank">several myths out there about relationships</a> that keep us from experiencing them directly. Not every relationship will go down in flames!</p>
<p>It’s crucial to communicate openly and honestly with your partner. Express your feelings and fears. If you feel yourself picking fights or pushing your partner away, be willing to take a step back and examine the root cause of your behaviors on your own terms. Then, it&#8217;s up to you to take responsibility, apologize and explain the root of the issue.</p>
<h2>2. You procrastinate on important tasks.</h2>
<p>What seemed harmless and inevitable in high school is not-so-harmless in adulthood — and it probably has a deeper meaning now. It’s about more than just being lazy (though that can play a part). Usually, you’re avoiding something else, like change or failure. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/the-imperfection-of-perfectionism/" target="_blank">If you’re a perfectionist</a>, you might be procrastinating to avoid making mistakes, for example.</p>
<h2>How to Stop:</h2>
<p>Take a good look into your psyche. What are you really putting off or avoiding? Think deeper than, “Ugh, I just don’t feel like doing that right now.” For example, if you’re procrastinating applying to a job out of college, maybe you’re actually trying to avoid taking responsibility for your financial independence.</p>
<p>Once you understand what’s holding you back, you can try to challenge those negative beliefs and fears. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/6-helpful-tips-on-how-to-unleash-your-motivation/" target="_blank">Take baby steps towards completing tasks</a> and visualize a great end result — but allow yourself to make mistakes along the way. Making mistakes is natural, and nobody’s perfect!</p>
<h2>3. You attempt to mask your emotions with excessive alcohol or drugs.</h2>
<p>Trust me — I know it’s not fun to feel pain or sadness. With alcohol and drugs readily available all over the place, we often turn to them to lessen the unpleasant feelings or to avoid them at all costs. Getting into the habit of using mind altering substances is dangerous and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/01/11-lessons-for-success-in-addiction-recovery/" target="_blank">can lead to addiction</a> — which many people see as self-sabotaging in and of itself.</p>
<h2>How to Stop:</h2>
<p>Feelings aren’t the enemy! Having feelings is healthy, but running away from them is not. By altering your state of mind to purposefully not think about your problems and the emotional toll they take on you, you’re setting yourself up for a breakdown. Eventually, all the hidden feelings are going to come out and bubble over.</p>
<p>Instead of holding everything in and avoiding your problems, allow yourself to experience emotions — even the negative ones. Find If you feel like your habit has become more of an addiction, seek out the help of a mental health professional.</p>
<h2>4. You have &#8220;Imposter Syndrome.&#8221;</h2>
<p>You may not have heard of this phrase, but you’ve probably felt the phenomenon in one way or another. <a href="https://hbr.org/2008/05/overcoming-imposter-syndrome" target="_blank">An article in <em>The Harvard Business Review</em></a> defines it as “a collection of feelings of inadequacy that persist despite evident success.”</p>
<p>In layman’s terms, feeling like you aren’t good enough or don’t deserve success in your field — and you’re afraid that other people are going to find out and think the same thing. You might feel like a fake or undeserving of praise, all while avoiding failure at all costs.</p>
<h2>How to Stop:</h2>
<p>Be your own cheerleader for a minute. Grab a pen and paper and write down your accomplishments, even the really small ones. Fight the negative voice in your head to prove to yourself that you are capable of doing great work. You are worthy of success. It takes time to break negative thought patterns, but with persistence, you can break out of them!</p>
<p>Now, after reading this, you may realize you’ve been self-sabotaging a little more than you thought you were. While self-sabotaging is definitely an unhealthy behavior, you can rest: it’s very common and <em>very</em> normal. Best of all: the behavior can be stopped!</p>
<p>Challenge your way of thinking and your behaviors while remembering to be kind to yourself. Instead of being your own worst enemy, why not be your own best friend?</p>

Long after the dust has settled, we replay the incident over and over, ruminating on what we could have done differently, analyzing each detail as a reflection of our shortcomings. This pattern of thought is not only counterproductive, it’s bad for our mental health. Excessive self-criticism can contribute to feelings of depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>The good news is there are many methods of moving on and forgiving ourselves. It is difficult to let go of the past, but not impossible.<span id="more-8595"></span></p>
<h2>Practice Mindfulness</h2>
<p>Mindfulness is all about being in the present moment, taking in every sensation of where you are and what you are doing right now. It is the antithesis of recalling painful memories. Every time your mind wanders to that mistake, focus on your current situation.</p>
<p>To aid the process, try therapeutic meditation techniques:</p>

</ul>
<h2>Stay Busy</h2>
<p>If you need more time to practice keeping your mind off mistakes during idle periods, in the meantime try filling up your schedule with productive, fun, or meaningful activities. You will be too busy to spend hours ruminating on perceived failures.</p>
<p>Here are some suggestions that might keep your calendar booked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Join a sports league</li>
<li>Regularly volunteer</li>
<li>Learn a new skill, such as a musical instrument</li>
<li>If you are single, go on lots of fun dates</li>
<li>Spend more time with friends and family</li>
<li>Book networking and professional development events to further your career</li>
</ul>
<h2>Think About Whether Other People Have Moved On</h2>
<p>Sometimes we ruminate on mistakes because they affect people we care about or those we are trying to impress. The collateral damage makes the blunder seem bigger than it actually is.</p>
<p>To more objectively evaluate the impact of your error, think about whether those involved have moved on or forgotten about the issue. Chances are they have. If they can let it go, so can you.</p>
<h2>Remember That Mistakes Are Opportunities to Learn</h2>
<p>Without your mistakes, you might not be nearly as wise as you are today. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/09/5-signs-fear-failure-keeping-best-life/" target="_blank">Failure is inevitable</a>, and it is a valuable way to learn more about yourself and the world. Rather than ruminating on the mistake itself, set aside time to recap the knowledge you gained.</p>
<h2>Make a Date to Dwell</h2>
<p>If you still want to process your feelings regarding the mistake, do so in a structured way. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/meet-therapists-melissa-moreno/" target="_blank">Talkspace therapist Melissa Moreno</a> recommended occasionally reserving an hour to think over the details. A therapy session, for example, is a great place to vent. You can also take an hour to write in a journal. Once that time is up, be vigilant about remaining in the present.</p>
<h2>Work With a Therapist to Dig Past the Mistake</h2>
<p>When we ruminate on a particular mistake, it usually means the incident is connected to deeper mental health issues. There can be several underlying factors, said <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/12/meet-our-therapists-kendra-simpson/" target="_blank">Talkspace therapist Kendra Simpson</a>, including family history, personality type and <a href="https://beckinstitute.org/automatic-thoughts-in-cbt/" target="_blank">automatic thoughts</a>. A <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/mental-health-counselor/" target="_blank">counselor</a> can help you understand why you are having trouble letting go. Mental health professionals can also teach you techniques for coping with guilt.</p>
<p>Mistakes do not define who you are. The fact that you dwelled on them, however, shows you want to become a better version of yourself. Embrace that spirit, and remember that learning to let go is also part of self-improvement.</p>
