				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Often, people think of perfectionism as positive. After all, who doesn’t want to be perfect? Perfection isn’t attainable, though. The search for it can ruin relationships and contribute to extreme levels of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxiety</a> and rigidity. Let’s examine an example of how perfectionism can sabotage an intimate relationship for a mother of two.</p>
<p>Anna (not her real name, a composite based off of several clients I have had in my practice) is a 35-year-old mom of two kids, ages three and five. She has always been a high achiever and currently is a high-performing real estate agent as well as a wife, mother, sister, daughter, homeowner, and pet owner. Anna has prided herself on her appearance, and she likes to keep her house tidy and neat. She also wants to be perceived as thin and fit, which she insists helps her make sales on the job.<span id="more-6864"></span></p>
<p>Anna’s schedule is punishing. She wakes up at 4:45 every morning to go to a “boot camp” class at her gym, showers and returns to feed her kids breakfast at 7 and get them out the door to school, at which point she cleans up the house and gets to work by 9:30.</p>
<p>This seems pretty good, but she is expected to be at work at 9. Her boss isn’t happy with her constant lateness, and her husband is perplexed by her behavior. He asks her why she is risking her job and her boss’s approval by coming in late every day.</p>
<p>Anna finds it impossible to contemplate not going to the gym in the morning, and equally impossible not to clean the house for at least 45 minutes each morning after the kids leave. She insists that she has to leave the house in order before she leaves for the day or else she can’t concentrate.</p>
<p>Anna tells her husband it is his fault she is late every day. If he cleaned the house with her every evening, then she wouldn’t have to clean so much in the morning. She says he may be fine with getting fat and lazy in his middle age, but physical fitness is important to her. There is no way around going to the gym.</p>
<p>Anna’s husband feels extremely irritated and frustrated. Not only is Anna insulting his appearance (which she does out of resentment, and subconsciously to turn the topic away from her exercising), but he does clean up with her every night after dinner. He frequently tells her, “Nothing can ever be good enough for you.” Sadly, he is right.</p>
<p>People often think women and men like my client, Anna, have “perfect lives.” But nobody sees the level of anxiety and the sacrifices that go into making their lives appear so “perfect.”</p>
<p>Anna ended up being reprimanded by her boss and having an <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/anxiety-attack-vs-panic-attack-one/" target="_blank">anxiety attack</a> because she did not know how she could possibly get to work on time and accomplish everything she wanted to do. She started to get up at 3:30 a.m. to clean the house prior to going to boot camp, which led to her feeling highly out of control and exhausted, and to seeking <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a>.</p>
<p>In our work together, Anna and I explored the origins of her perfectionism. They included a perfectionistic and anxious mom whose anxiety progressed to the point of agoraphobia. Anna learned as a child that having a spotless house and looking physically perfect were of paramount importance.</p>
<p>As a younger woman, before she had a family, Anna was able to keep all of the balls in the air, and received a lot of positive feedback from others for how “effortlessly” she kept everything together. But after having kids, some balls started to drop. Her therapy included a strong focus on self-acceptance, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/mindfulness/" target="_blank">mindfulness</a>, and learning to prioritize kindness and compassion (for herself as well as her husband and kids) over a “perfect” life.</p>
<p>If Anna’s story resonates with you, <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_BOTTOM&amp;utr_adgroup=bottom-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=6864" target="_blank">reach out to a therapist</a>. Nobody can be perfect, as Anna’s story indicates. Perfectionism is often an outgrowth of anxiety. It can take down everything in its path, including relationships, career, and happiness.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people strive for some form of perfection. Whether in their work, in their appearance, in their <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/relationships/" target="_blank">relationships</a>, in their expectations of others. There are a number of problems with perfectionism not the least of which is that it is simply not possible. Perfection is an ideal, which, almost by definition, is unattainable. Like trying to stand in the middle of a rainbow; as it’s approached, it recedes.</p>
<p>The other problem is that the criteria used to gauge perfection are suspect. How did we arrive at the criteria? Is the criteria valid? And, even if we were to judge the criteria as valid, will it remain so through time? If our expectations change, then how perfect could the criteria have been in the first place? Perfection suggests no room for improvement. It’s the ultimate, the top of the line, can’t get any better. It’s perfect! The irony of perfectionism is that to hold such a high standard, as an ideal, is an imperfection; it is an irrational and illogical standard by which to gauge and determine success or happiness.<span id="more-5823"></span></p>
<p>Those who strive for perfection often unwittingly make their lives somewhat miserable. There are a number of emotions that accompany the perfectionist attitude. Consider the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you get angry when you or others make mistakes?</li>
<li>Are you unwilling to make compromises?</li>
<li>Do you become easily disappointed?</li>
<li>Are you impatient?</li>
<li>Do you strive to be better than others?</li>
<li>Would you rather do something yourself than delegate it to someone else?</li>
<li>Do you feel that being average is equivalent to failure?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you answered yes to these questions, then there is a good chance you have some strong perfectionistic attitudes about yourself and others. And, you’re setting yourself up for disappointment. It is possible to be less than perfect and be satisfied. Let’s take a closer look at perfectionism and how it can become simple satisfaction with acceptable performance.</p>
<p>Perfectionism is a conditioned belief established in the mind during childhood. There is no absolute guideline or rule that says you must be perfect, or else. But, there may be a thought pattern that says just that. Parents, teachers, coaches and other adults in the life of a child can easily imprint the attitude and belief that anything less than perfection is failure. Exactly what perfection entails is often nebulous and ends up being what the adult says it is. This then teaches the child that perfection is attained only when the adult, the authority, so says.</p>
<p>As an adult, any achievement of perfection would then necessarily need to be confirmed by some authority figure. Often that authority figure is projected on the spouse, supervisor, manager or some adult in a position of perceived superiority. Excessive striving for approval by that authority becomes the means to obtain perfection, which can cause undue <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/stress/" target="_blank">stress</a> and pressure and actually diminish performance.</p>
<p>This results in approval ratings that are less than desired and then causing frustration, anger and depression. This may then cause an increase in striving, along with more stress and anxiety that further diminished truly effective performance, and the sought after approval. It becomes a downward spiral ending in excessive depressive moods, low motivation, decreased self-value and, in some cases, suicidal ideation. Life need not be like this.</p>
<p>The critical factor in perfectionism is what is referred to as “external locus of control,” which simply means that we seek the confirmation of our perfection from outside ourselves. Even if we ourselves hold the standard of perfection, we internalized that standard from adults while growing up. It is not a standard we have consciously, intelligently, and maturely chosen after some deliberate thought. Of course, we may use the word “perfect” in a generic sense referring to acceptable, or even better than acceptable, behavior or performance. That behavior or performance is gauged by realistic and reasonable criteria. This, however, is not perfectionism.</p>
<p>Perfectionism, by definition and by the conditioning in which it was internalized in the mind, suggests a standard both unreachable and only confirmed by an outside source. As such, the first step in overcoming perfectionism is to recognize where our high standards come from and then to adjust that standard according to our own internal framework.</p>
<p>That internal framework ought be based on a clear and rational assessment of individual capacities, interests, and motivations. An understanding of reality-based personal and professional goals, along with a rational understanding of what it means if those goals are not met, is important in re-evaluating exactly what determines success, as opposed to achieving perfection.</p>
<p>There are several beliefs that can run through the mind reinforcing perfectionism and those need to be changed. For example, the simple belief that “if I am not successful, then I am a failure” is perfectionistic. There is no middle ground. It is either success OR failure. There are no gradations.</p>
<p>In fact, it is possible to be 80% successful, and that in no way means failure. Even 30% success is not failure (think baseball batting averages); it simply suggests a need for improvement. In that sense, failure is simply feedback showing what needs to change to achieve a higher rate of success. And, indeed, viewing failure as feedback suggests there really is no such thing as failure, only feedback.</p>
<p>Another common belief is that “If I am not the best, I am no good.” This highly competitive attitude is based on the idea that the best is perfect and anything less than the best is the worst. It is also — like failure and success — devoid of gradations. It is externally oriented as the best is determined by comparison with others rather than internal standards of excellence.</p>
<p>However, even internal standards can be highly unrealistic, having been internalized as a child from overly demanding parents. It’s ironic that striving to be the best can cause increased stress and anxiety that reduces the chances of performing well, let alone at one’s best. And, by taking a more casual approach, there is less tension and pressure, and performance tends to be better. It’s a lot easier to be your best when you don’t have to be your best for fear of being the worst — and perhaps even being punished.</p>
<p>Personal satisfaction and happiness can come from successes and achievements that in turn come from effective performance and intelligent behavior. But, there is no evidence whatsoever that “perfection” equates to real satisfaction or genuine happiness; there is evidence to suggest that striving for perfection causes excessive stress, pressure, and tension that then gives rise to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxiety</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a>, psychosomatic symptoms, and a general dissatisfaction and unhappiness. That is the imperfection of perfection. Why not learn to be less than perfect; you’ll be happier and healthier.</p>
