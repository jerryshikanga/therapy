				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/06/coming-out-in-a-safe-space-a-therapists-experience/">Coming out</a> is the process of acknowledging both internally and socially that you are LGBTQ.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we live in a world in which “coming out” is still demanded of LGBTQ folks, as heterosexuality is seen as the default (read: normal) sexuality. As a result, we often push people to come out, especially publicly.</p>
<p>Let’s explore some of the nuances of coming out, and how this important step in an LGBTQ individual’s life can be both beneficial and challenging.</p>
<p><span id="more-11097"></span></p>
<h2>Benefits of Coming Out as LGBTQ</h2>
<p>There are, of course, many benefits to coming out as <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/lgbtq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LGBTQ</a>. Chief among them is reduced anxious and depressive symptoms exacerbated by the process of hiding — or living — two lives.</p>
<p>To say that coming out is the lifting of a heavy burden is an incredible understatement. This idea of psychological ease and relief after coming out is also been backed by research. <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-01/uom-sdh012513.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">LGBTQ people who are out face lower stress markers</a>, anxiety, and depressive symptoms than their queer counterparts who are not yet out.</p>
<p>Benefits of coming out may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced stress or anxiety</li>
<li>Finding community with others who are similar</li>
<li>Deepening of relationships (friendships, family, etc.)</li>
<li>Ability to find more potential romantic or sexual partners</li>
<li>Increased self-esteem</li>
</ul>
<p>The process of healing doesn’t end there, however, despite what many people think. Coming out is seen as the end of a healing process, when in reality it’s just the beginning of one.</p>
<h2>Coming Out is a Continuous Process</h2>
<p>Telling people that you are LGBTQ is freeing. Stepping out in the light for the first time, when you’ve lived in the shadows for so long, brings about an incredible sense of peace.</p>
<p>It also brings about a lot of responsibility. Coming out is a never-ending process. Often, LGBTQ people have to come out many times throughout their lifetimes as the enter new environments. Given that, you can see why the first declaration is just the beginning of a lifelong process.</p>
<p>Being “out” doesn’t mean that <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a> or fear of negative reactions to you goes away. For many, this continues (albeit with less intensity) over time. While hopefully you are accepted by the main players in your life, as an LGBTQ person you also have to consider how bosses, new coworkers, and new friends — and friends of friends — might react to this piece of your identity. You never know if they’ll hate queer folks or have misinformed views which tend to leak out into everyday conversations.</p>
<p>As an LGBTQ person, this means that you might have to walk into many uncomfortable situations throughout life, not knowing if you will be welcomed with open arms because of your queerness. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/01/what-causes-social-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nervousness when around new people or groups is common</a>, and can be difficult territory even for people who have long made peace with their queer identity. This worry can be extremely difficult, especially if you already deal with anxiety or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depression</a> related issues.</p>
<h2>Institutional Challenges After Coming Out</h2>
<p>While <a href="https://www.shape.com/lifestyle/sex-and-love/how-coming-out-improved-my-health-and-happiness" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">coming out</a> can help a LGBTQ identified person finally feel a sense of relief, it also brings about new potential challenges, most notably for trans or gender non-conforming folks. I’d like to think that we are on the precipice of a cultural shift in which transgender and gender nonconforming people are gaining more mainstream acceptance. However, we still have plenty of work to do.</p>
<p>Many out LGBTQ people face quality of life issues that have little to do with internal acceptance.</p>
<h3>Discriminatory Laws Against the LGBTQ Community Still Exist</h3>
<p>Only about half the states in America have laws that protect against any kind of LGBTQ discrimination in employment. And most of the states that do have some protections, are solely for anti-discrimination against LGB folks, leaving transgender people incredibly vulnerable to employment discrimination.</p>
<p>This contributes greatly to the issues of <a href="https://www.hrc.org/blog/transgender-workers-at-greater-risk-for-unemployment-and-poverty" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">underemployment and poverty in these communities</a>. There are similar trends in other main areas of life such as <a href="http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/non_discrimination_laws" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">housing, public accommodations, access to healthcare</a> and other benefits, etc.</p>
<p>This means that until a culture is completely accepting and celebratory of LGBTQ people there will be not only individual, but institutional challenges to face. Coming out, as a process, is incredibly helpful to the health and well-being of queer folks. However, legal and social circumstances may continue to complicate the picture for queer folks, which can be additionally complicated by their visibility.</p>
<h2>Seeking Support and Comfort as the Antidote to Ongoing Challenges</h2>
<p>LGBTQ folks need ongoing support after coming out to lead healthier lives, both physically and psychologically. Friends, accepting family members, and local community support spaces serve as beacons for the visibly out and not-out alike.</p>
<p>According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, <a href="https://www.nami.org/Find-Support/LGBTQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">LGBTQ people are 3 times more likely than straight counterparts to experience mental health issues like depression or anxiety disorders</a>. Finding and building a community of support can be life-saving. Often that comes with coming out to one’s self first, and then sharing that truth with others around you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When<a href="https://mic.com/articles/121256/meet-marsha-p-johnson-and-sylvia-rivera-transgender-stonewall-veterans#.QgPuYOyOn" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> trans women of color</a> led the way in the <a href="http://yearofwomenshistory.blogspot.com/2016/04/marsha-p-johnson-transgender-and-gay.html" target="_blank">Stonewall Riots</a> of 1969, Pride was born. It was a movement against police harassment and to claim space for a marginalized community. By fighting back, members of New York City’s queer community signaled they would not be pushed into the shadows anymore.</p>
<p>The Stonewall Riots are part of a decades-long campaign for LGBTQ visibility, inspired by the belief that accepting and celebrating ourselves and our community — even when society won’t accept or celebrate us — is a radical act. The courage to come out transformed LGBTQ people’s status in society, and in the face of continued discrimination, it remains a powerful weapon to guard one of our most powerful resources: our mental health.</p>
<p><span id="more-10191"></span></p>
<p>LGBTQ people have long known the political and personal power of self-love, and now mental health research has caught up. <a href="http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5217458" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Social support</a>, <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-32637-001" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">self-acceptance</a>, and an <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-021815-093153?casa_token=EQ_CvpRZGOkAAAAA%3AGf_3M6BLgtVx3ahhwDBjYEh7n2hRD_BQedLK84YaAWmr3ZaR7_BxgAGc_Cenof7lI_0qVG4E6yM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">affirming community</a> have all been shown by researchers to improve <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/ways-to-support-mental-health-lgbt-loved-ones/" target="_blank">LGBTQ people’s mental health</a>. Meanwhile, LGBTQ people, and particularly transgender people who report a <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/trgh.2015.0001" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">lack of acceptance</a> for themselves and their own identities, experience increased depression.</p>
<h2>Inspiring Quotes From LGBTQ Activists and Icons</h2>
<p>How do we love ourselves in a world that frequently continues to send the message that we don’t belong? Let these words of wisdom from <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/lgbtq/" target="_blank">LGBTQ</a> activists and icons lead the way.</p>
<ol>
<li>“I can’t be there for other people unless I’m there for myself. I can’t really work to push our movement without really investing in myself. By investing in yourself you’re also investing in your community. “ —<em><a href="http://diorvargas.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dior Vargas</a>, queer Latina mental health advocate and activist</em></li>
<li>“Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.” —<em><a href="https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/audre-lorde-thought-self-care-act-political-warfare" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Audre Lorde</a>, black feminist lesbian activist and icon</em></li>
<li>“We are all stronger, smarter, talented, beautiful, and more resilient than we were told.” —<em>transgender activist <a href="https://supportcece.wordpress.com/2012/08/02/may-11-2012-go-beyond-our-natural-selves/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CeCe McDonald</a></em></li>
<li>“I believe that telling our stories, first to ourselves and then to one another and the world, is a revolutionary act. It is an act that can be met with hostility, exclusion, and violence. It can also lead to love, understanding, transcendence, and community. I hope that my being real with you will help empower you to step into who you are and encourage you to share yourself with those around you.” —<em><a href="https://www.canadorecollege.ca/about/the-canadore-story/pride-month-janet-mock" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Janet Mock</a>, writer, TV host, and transgender activist</em></li>
<li>“Every person felt like they didn’t belong, or at some point felt like they didn’t need to carry on, they weren’t needed. So I think it’s important to show each other, “Look, we’re all in this together, we all feel this way, let’s work together.” —<em>LGBTQ activist, speaker, and social media influencer <a href="http://www.coleledford.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cole Ledford</a></em></li>
<li>“It is revolutionary for any trans person to choose to be seen and visible in a world that tells us we should not exist.” —<em><a href="https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/laverne-cox-birthday-quotes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Laverne Cox</a>, actress and transgender activist</em></li>
<li>&#8220;Once you&#8217;ve done something that you used to think was impossible, what could ever really scare you again?” —<em><a href="https://www.out.com/out-exclusives/out100-2014/2014/11/11/out100-ellen-page-entertainer-year" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ellen Page</a>, actress and LGBTQ activist, on coming out</em></li>
<li>“To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance.” —<em><a href="http://www.anothermag.com/art-photography/9012/how-oscar-wilde-paved-the-way-for-gay-rights-in-the-arts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oscar Wilde</a>, writer and gay provocateur</em></li>
<li>“No person is your friend who demands your silence, or denies your right to grow.” —<em><a href="http://alicewalkersgarden.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alice Walker</a>, writer and womanist</em></li>
<li>“Hope will never be silent.” —<em><a href="https://www.newhistorian.com/hope-will-never-silent-life-harvey-milk/7213/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Harvey Milk</a>, legendary gay activist</em></li>
</ol>
<p>While a struggle remains to secure full equality for all LGBTQ people, we hope the words of queer leaders who have led the way inspire us to keep moving forward. Wishing you a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/what-does-lgbtq-pride-mean-to-you/" target="_blank">Pride</a> full of joy, community, and self-love!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As rainbow streamers fill the air and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/lgbt/" target="_blank">LGBTQ</a> representation fills the streets, June is a time to celebrate LGBTQ identity and the contributions of the queer movement. Pride is a joyful time for the LGBTQ community and allies alike. It’s also a time to reaffirm our commitment to creating a more equal world. That’s why this <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/what-does-lgbt-pride-mean-to-you/" target="_blank">Pride</a>, we invite allies and supporters of the LGBTQ community — which should be everyone! — to show up for the mental health and wellbeing of their LGBTQ loved ones and the community at large.</p>
<p><span id="more-10166"></span></p>
<p>While in the past, psychologists considered gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer, and trans identity to be a mental illness, today’s professional standards recognize queer identity as normal and healthy. However, the LGBTQ community continues to face devastatingly high rates of mental illness, including elevated rates of <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/gay" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">depression</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/msmhealth/substance-abuse.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">substance abuse</a>, and <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2666491?redirect=true" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">suicide</a>. Harassment is also common, with 65% of LGBTQ people <a href="http://avp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/NCAVP_2016HateViolence_REPORT.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reportedly</a> experiencing some form of anti-LGBTQ harassment or discrimination in 2016.</p>
<p>Transgender people face a particularly heavy burden, with <a href="http://avp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/NCAVP_2016HateViolence_REPORT.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">increased rates</a> of harassment resulting in a staggering <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924933817318357" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">40 percent of transgender people</a> who have reported attempting suicide. These mental health struggles are due in large part to the effects of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5178031/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">discrimination</a>.</p>
<p>These facts are alarming, but they’re not an necessarily indication of what the future holds. As LGBTQ people have become more visible, resources have emerged to encourage and support their mental health. Change doesn’t come by itself, however, and the gains of the LGBTQ community are thanks to the tireless work of LGBTQ activists, and the support of allies. If you’re an ally, you can be part of this movement. Here are some ways allies can support the mental health of LGBTQ people in their lives, both for Pride Month and beyond.</p>
<h2>1. Question your Biases</h2>
<p>While you love your LGBTQ friends and family, and support LGBTQ rights, we all have <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150723083718.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">implicit biases</a> that can cause us to act in a discriminatory manner without being aware of it. To support the LGBTQ people in your life, first work on yourself.</p>
<p>Learn about LGBTQ identities, the LGBTQ movement, and the issues facing the LGBTQ community. Question your own assumptions about love, sex, and what it means to be part of a relationship or a family. It’s okay to have questions or make mistakes as part of the learning process. By educating yourself first, you can acknowledge these mistakes and grow from them to better support your loved ones.</p>
<h2>2. Respect Their Identity</h2>
<p>Research has found that affirming LGBTQ people’s identities can actually save their lives. For example, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/transgender-mental-health-issues-the-challenges-of-a-binary-world/" target="_blank">transgender</a> youth whose community uses their personally chosen names have a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-youth-transgender/using-transgender-youths-chosen-names-may-lower-suicide-risk-idUSKBN1HH2WH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reduced suicide risk</a>.</p>
<p>Respect the identity of LGBTQ people in your life by affirming how they choose to live, love, and identify. Use their chosen gender pronouns, respect how they choose to dress and present themselves physically, accept the gender of their partners, and don’t pressure them to conform to your or society’s idea of self-expression, family, or love.</p>
<h2>3. Don’t “Out” Them Without Their Permission</h2>
<p>Navigating when to be “out” about one’s sexual orientation or gender identity is a highly personal choice. There are lots of reasons an LGBTQ person might choose to be out in some contexts and not as open in others.</p>
<p>While there’s nothing shameful or secret about being LGBTQ, everyone has the right to make choices to facilitate their own comfort and safety. Follow the lead of your LGBTQ loved one in terms of how open they wish to be about their identity, and make sure they know you support them however they choose to express themselves.</p>
<h2>4. Have Their Back</h2>
<p>LGBTQ people face a set of obstacles or barriers in daily life that non-LGBTQ people simply don’t have to deal with. Your job as an ally is to lessen those barriers by making the spaces you’re in more LGBTQ-friendly.</p>
<p>If your relative is queer, you can educate other family members on LGBTQ identity, and support them if they’re faced with discrimination from family members. In the workplace or educational space, you can advocate for diversity trainings and gender neutral bathrooms. And anywhere you go, you can call out anti-LGBTQ words and actions when you see them.</p>
<h2>5. Support Them in Accessing Mental Health Resources</h2>
<p>Everyone needs support, whether it’s a friend whose shoulder we can lean on or a therapist to help us work through trauma from our past. Supporting the mental health of your LGBTQ loved ones requires all the conventional skills of being a good friend: be present, make sure they know you are there for them, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you notice they’re going through a hard time.</p>
<p>There are also extra ways you can support your LGBTQ loved ones. You can <a href="https://www.lighthouse.LGBTQ/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">help them find</a> <a href="https://www.wpath.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LGBTQ-friendly</a> therapists, whether brick and mortar, or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/LGBT/" target="_blank">online therapists</a>, connect them with LGBTQ support groups or mentors, and let them know they can always call you or any of the LGBTQ-friendly mental health hotlines (listed below) if they need help.</p>
<h2>6. Donate, Donate, Donate!</h2>
<p>We can make a big difference in our personal relationships, but movements don’t run on friendship alone — they also need monetary support. This Pride Month, support LGBTQ mental health by donating to LGBTQ-friendly mental health and anti-discrimination organizations like <a href="https://avp.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fenway Health</a>, the <a href="https://avp.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anti-Violence Project</a>, and <a href="https://www.translifeline.org/donate" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Trans Lifeline</a>.</p>
<p>As the bright colors of Pride fill the streets with joy, LGBTQ people and their allies take heart in a sense of community and belonging. When the confetti has cleared and the parade has ended, allies have a big role to play in making sure LGBTQ visibility isn’t just for one day. The more actively you advocate for the mental health and wellbeing of the LGBTQ community by raising awareness and supporting your loved ones, the closer we all come to making sure LGBTQ mental health is a reality every day of the year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was staying at my parents house for a summer internship before my senior year of college. It was an especially hot summer in LA, and I remember when I woke up that morning I couldn’t tell if what I was experiencing was a fever or if I had just forgotten what a real SoCal summer felt like. I remember sitting down on the toilet, looking between my legs and seeing blood. I remember thinking, “You’ve got to be kidding me.”</p>
<p>After one visit to my family doctor and then another to a specialist, I learned the man I had slept with the night before had left me with not one, but two treasures to remember him by: internal hemorrhoids with abrasions (the blood) and herpes (the fever). When I called to tell him, he didn’t answer. When I went to find him on the gay hook-up app where I had met him, his profile had disappeared. When I Googled his name and the hospital where he purported to work as a physician, I found nothing.</p>
<p>That’s the man who raped me. I don’t remember the name he gave me and I’m almost certain it was a lie, so let’s call him John R. Smith. The “R” stands for rapist.</p>
<p><span id="more-10086"></span></p>
<h2>An Assault on Identity</h2>
<p>Looking back I’m almost thankful for the medical trouble Mr. Smith caused in our encounter. In the immediate aftermath, it allowed to me to focus on my physical health, which was approachable and comforting in its capacity to be “fixed.” What he had done to my psyche, however, felt nebulously painful and, at the time, unfixable. So I avoided it.</p>
<p>Back at school, I was involved in an activist movement at my university to reform administrative responses to sexual violence. After seeing the need for reform first hand while working as HIV test-counselors on our campus, some co-workers and I took on leadership roles in the activist group. We were overly familiar with the issue: survivors of sexual violence were turning to our resource for a sense of security and comfort when the administration failed to adequately support them in the wake of an assault.</p>
<p>All of this is to say: I knew what happened to me wasn’t my fault. I knew the violence I encountered should not and did not tarnish my character. But I still felt those feelings. And I told no one.</p>
<p>As a gay man, I was caught in both the cultural expectations of my gender and my sexuality. What kind of man is raped? If he isn’t able to fend off his attacker, is he a man at all? Shouldn’t he have that John Wayne aversion to feeling that would allow him to disregard the incident entirely? I hated these questions, but I found myself asking them nonetheless. In my social life, I regularly derided “‘toxic masculinity” and considered myself free from its clutches. In the wake of my assault, I found myself feeling as if I had somehow lost the license to call myself a man.</p>
<p>My gayness complicated the issue further. Prior to my assault, I had just begun to feel the agency and self confidence required to comfortably explore my sexual desires and in doing so, enjoy the normalization of casual sex within the gay community. So much of gay male culture is about being “out and proud.”</p>
<p>I was supposed to be the fun and free-living gay guy who not only enjoyed casual sex, but navigated its treacherous, tangled roads with aplomb. What did it say about me that I couldn’t? I didn’t want to believe it happened. And for nearly a year, I told myself it didn’t.</p>
<h2>New Semester, New Love, New Problems</h2>
<p>When I returned to school in the fall, I did everything I could to avoid facing the truth. I kept having casual consensual sex, partially because I enjoyed it and partially because I wanted to prove to myself I still could. I became less involved with activism around sexual violence, using a heavy senior year course load as an excuse. I withdrew from friend groups and communities that demanded too much vulnerability from me.</p>
<p>And then I met a wonderfully tender guy, who became my first serious boyfriend.</p>
<p>As our relationship progressed, my assault and its effects on me became increasingly hard to hide. One night, after we had gotten into bed, my boyfriend rolled over to hold me. This was in no way unusual, but suddenly an insidious thought seeped in: “He’s going to rape you.”</p>
<p>I lied there in silence with my heart racing, convinced a man who never showed me anything but love and respect was about to attack me. After about twenty minutes he asked, “Is everything okay, babe?” I burst into tears. Sobbing, I told him I had been assaulted and it “really wasn’t a big deal.” It had just popped into my head, I said, but everything was fine.</p>
<p>He tried to talk about it with me the next morning. I evaded his questions and words of support.</p>
<p>And then came what I call the “night-jumps.” Almost every night, my boyfriend would wake up at around 2 a.m. to go pee. About three months into our relationship, I started shooting out of bed and shouting “Who are you?” upon his return. I would usually come to full consciousness about halfway through the question. He would apologize for startling me, I would apologize for startling him and we’d go back to bed. At first, we both thought it was sort of funny (I still sort of do), but eventually it became indicative of how deeply Mr. Smith had affected me. And my partner and I agreed I needed to seek professional help.</p>
<h2>Help is Waiting When You’re Ready</h2>
<p>I was blessed to grow up in a home and community in which <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a> wasn’t stigmatized. I already had a therapist who I had found after a bout with depression and social anxiety. We checked in when I felt I needed a “tune-up,” but when I returned for counseling on this particular subject, we hadn’t spoken for nearly a year.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a> and I worked on processing what had happened to me. We worked on developing new tools and strengthening my previously established tools to assist me in confronting and healing from the trauma. She encouraged me to tell my friends, particularly the gay male ones, knowing they were truly supportive and kind. Not only did these men welcome me with open arms, they shared their own experiences. From my work, I knew men who have sex with men regularly experience sexual violence. But until I brought it up, we never really talked about it.</p>
<p>I’m still dealing with my assault. I no longer jump out of bed screaming. I do sometimes have nightmares about it, but it’s rare. I’m always surprised by what will bring it back to the forefront of my mind. Certain sexual positions make me nervous and take me out of the moment. I still don’t like to be touched on the back of my neck. I recently re-watched an episode of a favorite TV show featuring what I once viewed as a harmless, though graphic, joke about sexual violence. I had to turn off the TV.</p>
<h2>A Space to Talk</h2>
<p>If anything this experience forced me to confront underlying issues I already had regarding my own masculinity and sexuality. It forced me to work on issues I’ve had with intimacy for as long as I can remember. I’m not thankful this happened to me, but I’ve grown from it. And furthermore, in working through it, I’ve become a better and more compassionate person. By opening up about my experience, by sharing it with my friends and in turn creating a space for them to share their own, I’ve strengthened my relationships and shifted the culture of support within my community. And that is something I am deeply proud of.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beginning your first year of college can inspire several emotions. From the first day of classes to finding your place in a sea of new faces, entering a university can be extremely exciting or exceptionally stressful. This can be an even more difficult transition when you are entering college as someone who openly identifies as LGBTQ+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer) and needs support navigating your academic journey.</p>
<p>Whether it’s finding the right academic club or LGBTQ+ resource that can aid in the transition from high school, being LGBTQ+ and new on a college campus can be fraught with troubles. For some students, the first question that comes to mind might be how inviting the college campus is or how truly accessible these LGBTQ+ resources are. This concern often leads to conversations around the need for queer students to be informed of what programs and services their campus offers when speaking specifically about mental health and wellness.<span id="more-6559"></span></p>
<p>The National Alliance on Mental Illness <a href="https://www.nami.org/Find-Support/LGBTQ" target="_blank">states</a> that LGBTQ+ people are almost three times more likely to experience a mental health condition. For those in the community, many are dealing with issues related to societal bias, systems of fear, and trauma related to both gender and sexuality. Mental health is something that, for many, is hidden because of stigma related to intersectional identities.</p>
<p>Rates of mental illness continue to be higher for those who identify as bisexual/questioning. Those in this population between the ages of 18-24 are three times more likely to attempt suicide. The rates are even higher for transgender students, who are four times more likely to attempt suicide, with 38%-65% experiencing suicidal ideation.</p>
<p>For many incoming LGBTQ+ students, fear becomes the leading reason they refuse to reach out for care. For students to successfully maintain their mental health in the first year of college, here are some tips to help find support and achieve success.</p>
<h2>Be Upfront About Your Needs</h2>
<p>The most common mistake incoming LGBTQ+ students make is not being forthright about their needs. What students often forget is that many of their RAs, professors, and other administrators have expertise around the needs of the LGBTQ+ community. Professionals are not able to assist, however, if they are not aware of the needs LGBTQ+ students have. Not being forthright about your needs can not only be detrimental to academic experience and success, but can have long term affects on your overall academic journey.</p>
<p>Reach out to the health center as soon as possible to learn what mental health resources your institution provides. Most universities provide 5-10 complementary visits to an on-campus counselor before you are referred out for additional care.</p>
<h2>Finding a Quality Mental Health Service Professional</h2>
<p>There have been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2072932/" target="_blank">several studies and articles</a> about students suffering in silence while navigating their early experience of higher education. Many of them have shared that they feel alone or misunderstood when talking about their mental health, leaving them worried about succeeding on their academic journey.</p>
<p>As someone who utilized mental health services for all four years of college, I know how important it is to find people on your campus who can point you toward quality mental health services. Heading into your health center and asking (or demanding) someone to assist you is essential to your health and overall academic success.</p>
<p>Most health centers have someone on staff who specializes in the needs of LGBTQ+ individuals. If a center does not have these resources, you usually can find someone on campus or in partnership with an organization that does. Some small rural colleges may not have these options, but there are several community support services that might be able to assist you as needed.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t find in-person mental health services on campus convenient or affordable enough, consider <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/" target="_blank">online therapy</a>. It can be a great option for students who want to quickly and confidentially connect with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/lgbt/" target="_blank">therapists who specialize in treating LGBTQ+ populations</a>.</p>
<h2>Find Student Support Groups</h2>
<p>One of the best suggestions I have seen so far about maintaining mental health in the first year of college is finding those who may be more tapped into the campus climate. Though putting yourself out there to meet other LGBTQ+ students may seem tough, it can be the one tactic that helps you survive the first year blues.</p>
<p>Pride and LGBTQ+ Centers are often great resources for those who might be looking for a community, but there are usually additional groups and organizations on campus that might serve as auxiliary support systems, depending on your level of comfort. For some, joining a honor society might work, or getting involved with a club that focuses on social justice and action might be a better fit. You may even want to connect with your Gender Studies/Women’s Studies department to find out what clubs and resources on campus can help you navigate your first year journey.</p>
<p>In all, the first year of college is tough and the pressure can increase once you begin focusing on your queer identity. Finding a sense of space and belonging is important to your success, but having quality resources to help you maintain your mental wellness is essential.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that transitioning to college is difficult, but the full burden of maintaining your mental wellness does not have to rest solely on your shoulders. Continue to reach out and ask the important questions about your mental health. It’s your right, not only as a student, but as a valued person of the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.carf.org/SOGIE_Case_Study/" target="_blank">Adam</a> was assigned a female gender at birth, but from an early age he did not feel comfortable identifying as female. Like many transgender people who struggle with mental health issues, the pressure of society’s gender norms caused stress and confusion.</p>
<p>Coming out as transgender is a challenge for anyone, but it was especially difficult for Adam. He grew up in a small, close knit town with one high school. His uncle was also his landlord, an example of how his environment could be suffocating at times.</p>
<p>At the age of 15, Adam came out as transgender and began identifying as a man. With the exception of his father, no one in his family or community supported him. Peers mercilessly bullied and ridiculed him until he dropped out of high school. Then the final blow hit: Because of his decision, his uncle, the landlord, refused to provide him a residence.<span id="more-6226"></span></p>
<p>Adam and his father left town and headed to Los Angeles to start a new life. He had researched a Los Angeles-based <a href="http://www.layn.org/" target="_blank">youth center that supported transgender people</a>. The staff at the youth center connected him with a therapist, and the healing began.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Adam’s story only speaks to a few of the mental health issues transgender people tend to endure. Here are some <a href="http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/Executive%20Summary%20-%20FINAL%201.6.17.pdf" target="_blank">enlightening statistics</a> that allude to other issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>According to a survey of 27,715 respondents from all fifty states, 10% of transgender people who are out experience violence from a family member</li>
<li>People who are out or perceived as transgender in school environments are more likely to be victims of verbal harassment (54% of survey respondents), physical attacks (24%), and sexual assault (13%)</li>
<li>39% of respondents experienced serious psychological distress</li>
<li>40% had attempted suicide</li>
</ul>
<p>This article will help you learn more about transgender mental health issues and become an advocate for the trans community. If you identify as transgender, you might find some useful information and resources.</p>
<h2>Gender Dysphoria</h2>
<p>Many transgender people experience <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria" target="_blank">gender dysphoria</a>, a conflict between their biological or assigned gender and the gender they identify with. Kai, a transgender man, experienced emotionally painful gender dysphoria when he was using testosterone to better transition but still had his period every month.</p>
<p>“It was a monthly reminder of a past part of myself I have walked away from,” he said. “After all this work to look and feel happy in my own body, it felt as though my body was betraying me.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.therapydepartment.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Kristie Overstreet</a>, who specializes in working with transgender clients, offered the example of a transgender man who feels uncomfortable with his high-pitched voice. He wishes he had a lower-pitched voice to make it easier to “pass” as a man.</p>
<p>Gender dysphoria can cause severe anxiety and depression. Transgender people who suffer from it may have anxiety about whether they will ever feel comfortable in their bodies. Perceived failures to transition may lead to depression.</p>
<h2>Workplace Discrimination and High Unemployment</h2>
<p>When transgender people are out about their orientation — or look or behave in a way where people can discern that part of their identity — they are more likely to be unemployed or underemployed. It is also difficult for them to keep a job for as long as cisgender people. Employers are likely to discriminate against transgender employees by making excuses for firing them or denying a promotion.</p>
<p>Likely related to issues of employment, about 30% of respondents in the aforementioned 2015 survey reported experiencing homelessness and extreme poverty. During the time of the survey, the unemployment rate for transgender people was three times the national average.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.intimatehealthconsulting.com/" target="_blank">Bianca Palmisano</a>, who trains behavioral and medical health professionals to treat LGBTQ patients, has worked with transgender clients who have been concerned for their safety in the workplace. To avoid persecution, they have dressed in ways that will not draw attention but also do not align with their transgender identity. They have also avoided being in the bathroom with co-workers by drinking less liquids at work and using off-site bathrooms.</p>
<h2>Media and Legal Vilification Regarding Bathroom Use</h2>
<p>There have been many <a href="https://www.glaad.org/publications/victims-or-villains-examining-ten-years-transgender-images-television" target="_blank">TV shows and films</a> that feature transgender characters who are predatory, psychotic, or unable to function. These portrayals have implied transgender people are inherently disturbed or doomed to be nothing but victims.</p>
<p>Publications and news organizations have <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/04/28/transgender-bathroom-bills-discrimination/32594395/" target="_blank">portrayed transgender people as “perverts”</a> who are trying to harass cisgender people in bathrooms.</p>
<p>“The media is pretending trans men don’t exist and trans women are predators,” Palmisano said.</p>
<p>Despite several surveys and <a href="http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Herman-Gendered-Restrooms-and-Minority-Stress-June-2013.pdf" target="_blank">studies showing transgender people are more likely to be victims of violence</a> — not perpetrators — when using restrooms, this false narrative has continued. Lawmakers in many states have recently proposed legislation to limit transgender rights regarding the use of public bathrooms.</p>
<h2>Discrimination from Behavioral and Medical Health Professionals</h2>
<p>Since the idea of identifying as transgender emerged, many <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/michael-w-chapman/johns-hopkins-psychiatrist-transgender-mental-disorder-sex-change" target="_blank">doctors, therapists, and psychiatrists have tried to pathologize it</a> rather than acknowledging it as an identity. Because of this discrimination, roughly 33% of transgender people have negative experiences with health professionals.</p>
<p>When <a href="http://www.jmaseiii.com/" target="_blank">J Mase III</a>, a trans performance poet and founder of <a href="http://www.awqwardtalent.com/" target="_blank">awQward</a>, consulted a psychiatrist to be approved to donate a kidney to a friend, the psychiatrist assumed something had traumatized him and caused his transgender identity. He saw being transgender as a mental health problem, not an identity someone could be happy about.</p>
<h2>Understanding What It Means to be Transgender</h2>
<p>Now that gay and lesbian people have gained more rights, advocates have turned the spotlight toward the transgender community.</p>
<p>“The trans community is not so invisible anymore,” said John T. Nash, who spent many years marketing to the LGBTQ community and now co-hosts <a href="http://www.focusgroupradio.com/" target="_blank">The Focus Group</a>.</p>
<p>This may be a positive step, but it has also revealed how uneducated most Americans are on what it means to be transgender and how to interact with transgender people.</p>
<p>“How do you navigate [transgender issues] in a binary society?” Nash asked. “Think of the dissonance of having to describe who you are on multiple levels.”</p>
<p>For example, many cisgender people do not know what pronouns to use when referring to transgender people. Mase recommended being safe by starting with “they” pronouns until you know which pronoun the transgender person prefers.</p>
<p>There are also cisgender people who still use the term “transexual” and confuse it with being transgender. “Transexual” is actually an outdated term some people find offensive, according to Palmisano.</p>
<p>The many identities within the umbrella of the transgender experience can be even more difficult for cisgender people to grasp. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Genderqueer: not subscribing to conventional gender distinctions</li>
<li>Gender nonconforming: not following ideas about how they look look or act based on the gender they were assigned at birth</li>
<li>Gender non-binary: some use this term as a synonym for genderqueer and vice versa and prefer it because of the history of heterosexual, cisgender people using “queer” as an insult to put down LGBTQ people</li>
</ul>
<p>Because most of the cisgender people around them are so far from understanding transgender issues, it can be hard for transgender people to feel accepted and comfortable. This issue most likely contributes to feelings of depression and anxiety.</p>
<h2>Lack of Representation in the LGBTQ Community</h2>
<p>Unfortunately transgender people face discrimination within the LGBTQ community as well. There are many LGBTQ people who refuse to acknowledge the existence of transgender people or think they are “gross,” Mase said. The acronym suggests a cohesion that does not actually exist.</p>
<p>Both Mase and Kai noted that white cisgender men, particularly gay men, tend to lead most LGBTQ organizations or communities, even ones that focus on transgender issues. This lack of trans leadership makes it difficult for transgender people — especially those of color — to feel empowered. Transgender people of color need more support and representation, especially because they are more likely to be victims of violence and discrimination compared to white transgender people.</p>
<h2>Resources for Supporting Transgender Mental Health</h2>
<p>If you want to become an advocate for the transgender community, support efforts to improve transgender mental health or look for mental health treatment options, the first step is becoming educated. Here are some resources to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mazzonicenter.org/trans-health" target="_blank">Philadelphia Trans Health Conference</a></li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Mental Health Month may be over, but we are still dedicated to empowering individuals to “light their way” to better mental health, happiness, and improved well-being. As part of this commitment, we are continuing to profile “Mental Health Warriors,” or individuals who have been outspoken in their advocacy and support for mental health issues. This week, we caught up with West Hollywood city councilor, human rights lawyer, and LGBTQ activist, John Duran.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Talkspace:</strong> How did you first get involved in advocating for equal rights and mental health?</p>
<p><strong>John Duran:</strong> I first got involved in June of 1985, when a close friend of mine named Scott Fleener died very suddenly of HIV related pneumonia. I hadn’t been very politically involved up to that point. I couldn’t tell you who my member of Congress was or how he or she voted on issues regarding equal rights or mental health. His unexpected death at 26 years of age rocked my world.<span id="more-6048"></span></p>
<p>I vowed to get involved in changing the systems that seemed incompetent and unresponsive. With a little bit of ADD and lots of caffeine, I began to study the California Assembly and Senate to learn about how every representative voted, who funded their campaigns and what possibly motivated them. This was the early beginnings of the creation of what would become the LIFE AIDS Lobby — a statewide organization that wrote most of the laws around the HIV epidemic here in California.</p>
<p><strong>TS:</strong> What resources have you found to be most effective in supporting a healthy community?</p>
<p><strong>JD:</strong> I think one of the things that I have learned is that neither political party is right or wrong 100% of the time. I happen to lean to the left politically. But working with women and men who leaned right — although I had strong disagreements with them on some issues — on other issues, some of their perspective had merit. One of these issues was the concept of partnering with the private sector in the delivery of health services.</p>
<p>When my city (West Hollywood) was formed in 1984, we didn’t have an economic tax base to fund the wide array of government assistance that was needed around the epidemic. We needed millions of dollars in services for treatment, care, prevention, mental health counseling, testing, and hospice care. We didn’t have the resources to do all those things at once.</p>
<p>A very bright woman named Jody Curley came up with the idea to use the limited tax revenues we had to contract with private sector nonprofit organizations for the basic delivery of government services. We were able to leverage our dollars effectively to meet the high demand for services that existed at that time. It is a model that we still have in place today and seems to be a great way to use limited tax dollars in a manner that strengthens nonprofits and delivers government services to people in great distress and need.</p>
<blockquote><p>Watch John Duran’s keynote speech from Talkspace’s Reshaping Behavioral Health 2017 Conference in San Francisco.</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsszqOXOHcM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>TS:</strong> You started this work in the 80s at the height of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. How did this tragedy impact the mental health of the community and how has it shifted since?</p>
<p><strong>JD:</strong> It was a terrible 10 years. From 1985 — 1995, I lost 104 friends to HIV/AIDS. My city was devastated with a loss of 10,000 residents within a few square miles. It is said that there are three conditions which have the capacity to change everything in a culture: war, famine, and plague. We were witnessing plague in America — and most of the lives cut down where young vibrant men and women.</p>
<p>Initially, many of the mental health issues focused around death and dying, utilizing Elizabeth Kubler Ross’ 5 stages of grief. I think it is hard enough to go through that cycle once when you lose somebody really close to you like a spouse, best friend, or family member. But when you have to go through the cycle dozens of times within one year — I don’t know if it’s possible to experience anything other than anger and depression. The shock wears off quickly. And the concept of bargaining is never initiated. And can there ever be acceptance under those extreme conditions? Which leads me to state where I believe we are today.</p>
<p>There are 1000’s of walking wounded warriors in our society today who were eyewitness to the epidemic. Women and men who responded on the front lines to the loss of 500,000 dead Americans. These individuals are now middle aged and seniors. And I believe we still carry varying degrees of PTSD. How could we not when we buried hundreds of people and only began to experience relief from the deaths in the late 1990’s. Now AIDS deaths are not as common. But I believe we are seeing high levels of alcoholism, depression, and other mental health disorders being exhibited in the generation that responded to the epidemic.</p>
<p><strong>TS:</strong> Who are some of your mental health and activism heroes, i.e., who has inspired you along the way?</p>
<p><strong>JD:</strong> I suppose I could (and should) write a book about these heroines and heroes who responded to plague in our midst during one of the darkest times in American history. Some people may not have been just as impacted without being immersed in the high concentration areas. But the loss of 500,000 Americans in our cities and communities is a great tragedy based on the number of individuals lost alone, without getting into the awful politics and culture wars that took place simultaneously. But if there is one person that stands out in my mind — it is my own therapist Karin Robbins who now lives in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>She was a volunteer therapist at AIDS Project Los Angeles. I was very sick in the middle 1990’s from HIV and the from accompanying mental health break. My spirit was on life support also. She came in and sat with me once a week for many months. She made me take out my list of lost friends with 104 names on it and go name by name telling each of their stories and what the person meant to me. I told her I wouldn’t and couldn’t do it. That it would destroy me to travel that path! She persisted.</p>
<p>Some days we only got through one or two names. Some days I just wept. Some days we shared a laugh. But her persistence, by holding my hand and walking me through darkness, was the beginning of my healing. She also guided me into a 12 step meeting group which I still attend regularly. And because of her patience and persistence, I was able to put Humpty Dumpty back together again. Don’t get me wrong. You can still see the scarring and suture lines. But it enabled me to run for public office and use my experiences for the benefit and assistance of others. I owe my life to her.</p>
<p><strong>TS:</strong> What advice or wisdom would you share with a young person struggling with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/addiction/" target="_blank">addiction</a> or mental illness?</p>
<p><strong>JD:</strong> I would say first of all, recognize that this is an illness and you are not crazy (OK. Maybe a little bit — but it can be addressed!). I had to learn that I had a physical allergy to alcohol and drugs that once I started — I couldn’t stop. I also had to learn that my mind operated in an obsessive way that could disturb my sleep, my eating habits, my daily activities — my entire life! When my heads starts to spin — it did feel crazy and I thought the only way to make it stop was to get high or loaded. And lastly, that I suffered from spiritual maladies — my spirit was gravely ill and completely self-focused.</p>
<p>I had to find a pathway back to my notion of a higher power and to open up and speak with others in the same predicament — even though I ABSOLUTELY did not want to do this. But it saved my soul and has kept me clean and sober for over 20 years. Do I crave alcohol or drugs today? No. Rarely. But do I still hear the nagging chorus of voices in my head from time to time? Yes. And sometimes it can reach the level of heading towards a migraine headache.</p>
<p>So, I know what I have to do. Go to a meeting. Be of service. Call my sponsor. And I pledge this to you — you never have to drink or use again. It can be done. And there are thousands of us doing it. Call your local office of AA for further assistance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>To start a discussion on LGBTQ activism and mental health during Pride Week, we asked two LGBTQ activists of different generations to meet and discuss their views, experiences, and perspectives. <a href="http://thenoker.com/" target="_blank">Michael Noker</a>, a millennial who has written about LGBTQ issues, interviewed Patrick Cleary, a long-time LGBTQ activist who fought for gay rights during the AIDS epidemic and beyond. <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two discuss the grief and mental health implications of losing a generation as well as the critical need for activism.</span></i></em></p>
<p><strong>Noker:</strong> What would you say was the most monumental moment for the LGBTQ movement in your lifetime?</p>
<p><strong>Cleary:</strong> There are a few, so forgive me for not picking only one. The <a href="https://www.fda.gov/forpatients/illness/hivaids/history/ucm151074.htm" target="_blank">1987 FDA approval of AZT</a>, a drug for treating <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/mental-health-issues-people-living-hiv-deal/" target="_blank">HIV/AIDS</a> is the most monumental thing I can think of as a gay man, because it meant that my friends stopped dying so often.</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan hadn&#8217;t even said the word &#8220;AIDS&#8221; until the year before. The honest opinion of most of the country was that AIDS was something that should burn itself out. It only affected gay guys and drug addicts, and we weren&#8217;t worth the trouble.<span id="more-6100"></span></p>
<p>Participating in <a href="http://www.actupny.org/" target="_blank">ACT UP</a> and <a href="http://queernationny.org/history" target="_blank">Queer Nation</a>, holding <a href="http://activehistory.ca/2015/06/the-die-in/" target="_blank">die-ins</a> and marches and literally going into Catholic churches and shouting &#8220;Shame!&#8221; at priests who refused to acknowledge that birth control also saved lives…that&#8217;s what did it.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/supremecourt/future/landmark_lawrence.html" target="_blank">Lawrence v. Texas</a> is another one. I don&#8217;t know if a lot of the younger, even fairly socially aware adults these days knows that it took until 2003 to strike down sodomy laws in the country. Until then there were states where you didn&#8217;t check into hotel rooms together if you didn&#8217;t want to get raided, where gay clubs were still targeted by the police, and where you could be arrested and imprisoned for gay sex.</p>
<p>And of course it was during my lifetime — although I was a baby at the time — but the S<a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-stonewall-riot" target="_blank">tonewall Riots</a> got it all started. Because I wasn&#8217;t old enough to appreciate the difference from before then, I can&#8217;t really speak to it. It was within my lifetime, though.</p>
<p><strong>Noker:</strong> I’ve noticed a lot of emphasis on getting “woke” lately. There’s a sort of backlash against anyone who doesn’t care enough about the right things. People tend to call out would-be “slacktivists” as effective apologists. Is this new? How do you feel about it?</p>
<p><strong>Cleary:</strong> These days everything is sped up because the dissemination of information and ideas is sped up. Issues that may have taken years to spread can become memes within days, and that&#8217;s when the backlash begins.</p>
<p>Humans are not great with nuance. Small differences in approach toward the same goals escalate into unbridgeable rifts in groups that would make tremendous allies, if only everyone would sit down and figure out what we have in common and how the strengths of one group can help the others.</p>
<p>In a way, the backlash is also coming from people my age who got exhausted through the process of fighting for a certain set of rights and get offended when we&#8217;re told we&#8217;re part of the problem. As an older, not-quite-so-active activist, I struggle to resist the urge to dismiss issues I haven&#8217;t experienced personally, and not to elevate the experiences I had into a mythos meaning I can be forgiven for any further transgressions.</p>
<p>I know a lot of older white gay men who believe the AIDS crisis gives them immunity from ever being criticized for their way of thinking. It&#8217;s really hard not to say, &#8220;Do you understand that every friend I had in 1988 is now dead?&#8221; That doesn&#8217;t help anything, though.</p>
<p><strong>Noker:</strong> I think that’s something really important to point out. It’s also something I would not have thought about. The gay community isn’t short on misogyny and sexism (and a hundred other issues), but I don’t know if anyone’s taken the time to appreciate exactly how much HIV/AIDS took out of the previous generation. A lot of the gay men taking criticism for abandoning transgender issues (or even feminist issues), for example, were already exhausted and resigned several years before gay marriage was legalized. I hadn’t considered the other side.</p>
<p><strong>Cleary:</strong> And I forget that most of the younger crowd have no idea how bad it was, even if you know intellectually how bad it was. In one year, I remember keeping track and I&#8217;d gone to 53 funerals. That&#8217;s more than one a week. I was on the tail end of this. I was only in my early 20s. Guys in their 30s and 40s were basically wiped out. A lot of the groups scolding us were nowhere to be found back then. But holding that anger doesn&#8217;t help me at all, and it doesn&#8217;t help the conversation at all either.</p>
<p><strong>Noker:</strong> What was the most important issue the LGBTQ movement focused on? What do you think the most important issue facing our community is today?</p>
<p><strong>Cleary:</strong> I think it is extremely dangerous to &#8220;rank&#8221; issues based on importance, because each and every issue migrates in terms of importance, depending upon the circumstances of the day. Today I think the main thing we need to battle is within our own communities, and that&#8217;s inclusion and intersectionality. I believe there&#8217;s a terrible rift that&#8217;s grown between those who are experiencing a level of comfort and those who are still in desperate circumstances. To rest on the laurels of battles we think we&#8217;ve won won&#8217;t keep things moving in the right direction, and most likely will result in our falling backward.</p>
<p><strong>Noker:</strong> I did notice that once gay marriage was legal across the United States, everybody kind of cracked the metaphorical beer. Does that worry you, too?</p>
<p><strong>Cleary:</strong> We&#8217;re already seeing the country line up toward removing such things as marriage equality and they&#8217;re taking up new battles like bathroom segregation as a way of attacking transgender rights. If you&#8217;re not willing to fight for the rights of all oppressed people (and all people in general, but minorities particularly), then you have no right to complain when your rights are eroded alongside theirs.</p>
<p><strong>Noker:</strong> Do you feel that <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/what-does-lgbtq-pride-mean-to-you/" target="_blank">Pride</a> still holds significance in today&#8217;s community? If so, do you believe it&#8217;s become less significant over the last couple decades?</p>
<p><strong>Cleary:</strong> Lost significance? No. Changed focus? Yes.</p>
<p>I recall there was a hugely political atmosphere to my first Pride event in 1984. Stonewall was only 15 years before, so imagine if Stonewall had happened in 2002, and you&#8217;ll get a bit of the vibe of it. I looked to see if I could find any images of the Boston Pride event from that year, and one of the first results is &#8220;Black and White Men Together.&#8221; I totally remember this because that was a hot-button issue for a lot of gay people: the idea of not only gay couples, but interracial couples at the same time.</p>
<p>We were also marching for AIDS research and funding, against sodomy laws, anti-discrimination laws, etc. So there were different stakes for a lot of the people in my demographic that have been lessened today.</p>
<p><strong>Noker:</strong> So the tone has undergone a major shift.</p>
<p><strong>Cleary:</strong> There&#8217;s also been quite a bit of what I&#8217;d consider &#8220;pink washing,&#8221; where corporations have caught on that a lot of gay and lesbian couples have disposable income (this was a discovery made in around the mid-1990s, from what I recall). Sponsorship has gone beyond the local gay bars providing water bottles and floats to large-scale celebrations. This can be terrific but changes the dynamic a lot.</p>
<p>Also, we don&#8217;t focus on Pride as a political act so much anymore. &#8220;We&#8217;re here, we&#8217;re queer, get used to it&#8221; sounds incredibly trite these days. Nonetheless, it was a battle cry that was super-dangerous to say when I was at my first few Pride events. I&#8217;ve been hit by bottles thrown by the crowd in Boston and in Washington, and the police at that time didn’t think of doing anything about it.</p>
<p>But because the police give lip service to Pride events, does that mean they&#8217;ll give their full attention to a homicide of a trans woman of color in their precinct? It&#8217;s something to think about.</p>
<p><strong>Noker:</strong> I’ve also noticed that a lot of Pride events are starting to charge admission now.</p>
<p><strong>Cleary:</strong> I don&#8217;t attend Pride that much anymore, because it seems more like a big block party than anything, and I&#8217;ve never been one for block parties.</p>
<p><strong>Noker:</strong> What could the upcoming generation and its LGBTQ community be doing to make the most difference?</p>
<p><strong>Cleary:</strong> Drop cynicism. I feel so old for saying this, but I&#8217;ve now been involved in activism in one form or another for more than 30 years. Every new generation of activists thinks they are the only generation who has ever fought for a cause, and that they are the only generation who are facing hopeless circumstances.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so tempting to believe the odds are stacked so much against us that there&#8217;s no sense in fighting at all, or that the people who aren&#8217;t expressing your exact opinion will not be useful to your cause. But that&#8217;s exactly what the people who would silence us count on to get us out of the way.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s because we are exposed to so many voices every single day via the media available to us, but I see so many younger people deriding one another for issues they essentially agree upon. That doesn&#8217;t help anyone at all. Listening to those who have it harder than you and using whatever social or economic clout you have to assist them is so very important.</p>
<p>So work toward the things you think will make the most difference for the people who need it the most, and don&#8217;t always assume everyone&#8217;s motivations are suspect. If you do suspect the motivations, know enough to use what you can from those individuals and groups and then discard the rest.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every June, communities across the world celebrate Pride, also known as “Gay Pride” or “LGBTQ Pride.” For many it’s a celebration of identity, representing freedom of expression and freedom from social oppression. For others Pride represents a time in which they can watch from afar those who have been able to live their lives in an “out and proud” way. For people not in the LGBTQ communities, the month’s events may represent something different.</p>
<p>Pride began as a movement to solidify the rights and existence of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people. The Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s-1960s — in which Black communities fought for the same legal and civil rights of their white counterparts — spawned its creation.</p>
<p>There are differing stories as to how Pride actually began, yet <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/06/10/pride-parade-evolution/#AmTw4QRHIZqX" target="_blank">people commonly think it originated in New York City</a>. Like other activist movements, the modern gay liberation or civil rights movement included violent interactions with police. Most people think of the Stonewall Rebellion (also referred to as riots) as the catalyst for the modern march for civil rights for LGBTQ folks.<span id="more-6045"></span></p>
<p>Back in the 1960s, the Stonewall Inn, a now historic site thanks to former President Obama, was a popular hangout for LGBTQ folks in New York City. It represented that safe space in which people with varying sexual and gender identities could come together, celebrate themselves, and live boldly. While New York City has long been a mecca for the “others,” the misfits, and all else, it was still difficult to be an LGBTQ person then.</p>
<p>Riots broke out at the Stonewall Inn when police raided the bar in an effort to accost or arrest its patrons. Violence ensued. After that day, people gathered and marched through the streets of New York City demanding equal rights and treatment from the government and police. The dam of oppression against LGBTQ peoples had been broken for the first time in American history. Those marches served as the precursor to the marches around the world that now typically include lots of dancing, fun, love, and celebration of self and community.</p>
<p>June is a time in which I think it’s helpful to ask, what does Pride actually mean? When I think of Pride and the modern movement for LGBTQ acceptance, I think of:</p>
<p>P: Perseverance — progressing forward in the face of difficulty or oppression<br />
R: Resilience — toughness, bouncing back from pain, and continuing to press on<br />
I: Inclusion — embracing the human desire to be a part of something greater than one’s self<br />
D: Determination — continuing to fight unwaveringly for rights and dignity in the face of continual hatred, judgment, ignorance, and bigotry<br />
E: Expression — allowing one’s self to be free to live and exist as one wants</p>
<p>As LGBTQ folks around the world continue to fight for livelihood and equal rights under the law this June, ask yourself this: What does Pride mean to you?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1965, TIME magazine published an article titled “<a href="http://time.com/vault/issue/1965-02-12/page/50/" target="_blank">Homosexuals Can Be Cured</a>.” The article focused on the “triumphant” results of group therapy work led by psychiatrist Samuel Hadden, who was also a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School at the time. Hadden had been leading long-term (four to eight year) therapy sessions for men who identified as homosexual in the hopes of “curing” them of their sexual “perversions.”</p>
<p>TIME’s article celebrated Hadden’s ability to help men work through their “symptoms” of “illness”—whether that was wearing inappropriately feminine clothing or being sexually interested in men instead of women. Hadden was only one of many esteemed psychiatrists and psychologists to consider — and treat — homosexuality as a sickness during the 1960s. In fact, homosexuality was not removed from the “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders” [DSM] until 1973.</p>
<p>The pathologizing of homosexuality was not, however, contextually specific to 20th century America. Many of the earliest writings condemning homosexual acts as “unnatural” caught on in 12th century Europe, when religious leaders like Saint Thomas Aquinas denounced homosexuality as a sin in their early writings. Popular disdain against homosexuality, began in the realm of religion, but it quickly moved into the legal arena in centuries to come.<span id="more-5633"></span></p>
<p>For example, in the New Haven colony in 17th century colonial America, homosexuality was not only an illegal crime, but one punishable by death. Into the 19th century, however, “[M]edicine and psychiatry were effectively competing with religion and the law for jurisdiction over sexuality,” as noted in UC Davis’ resources on <a href="http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_mental_health.html" target="_blank">Homosexuality and Mental Health</a>.</p>
<p>Although the cultural shift to regarding homosexuality as an issue of mental health seems anachronistic today, it was, at the time, perceived as progressive. Homosexuality went from being denounced as a sin punishable by death (according to both religious and legal frameworks), to a diagnosis of a mental illness one could not control — but that could be “cured,” as TIME put it in 1965.</p>
<p>Mental illness as an umbrella term was still highly stigmatized at the time — <a href="https://ijmhs.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13033-015-0002-1" target="_blank">and continues to be today, to a lesser extent</a>. It’s only through <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/the-pain-of-anti-lgbtq-bullying-ending-the-silence/" target="_blank">people sharing their stories</a> that there is more visibility— and less stigma —around mental health issues and corresponding treatments. Though in culturally hostile contexts (whether that means 20 years ago or in parts of the world where social stigma related to historically abject identities pervades), sharing is not an option.</p>
<p>But let’s rewind for a second: not all experts in the 1950s and 60s drank the homosexuality-as-illness kool aid. As early as 1905, Sigmund Freud had actually proposed a foundational theory about human sexuality that is now referred to as “inherent bisexuality.” Despite what his predecessors said and did to those they perceived as “sick” with homosexuality, Freud believed all humans were born bisexual, and that their later preferences were simply results of life experiences and conditioning from parents and other loved ones.</p>
<p>In a 1935 letter he wrote to a distraught mother, Freud explicitly discouraged psychiatrists from diagnosing homosexuality as an illness worthy of treatment: &#8220;Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it cannot be classified as an illness.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, when Zoology-trained Alfred Kinsey entered the conversation in 1948, he destabilized the status quo from the vantage point of another discipline, gathering empirical findings about human sexuality. Homosexuality is, if not common in animals, at least present. By developing a groundbreaking study of sexual behavior among American adults (men and women), Kinsey was ultimately able to prove that homosexual behavior was far more common and complex than was previously assumed.</p>
<p>By the 1950s, Freud and Kinsey’s perspectives on homosexuality had been either ignored or disputed by conservative psychiatrists who sought to uphold the predominance of heteronormativity. For many, after the upheavals of the Second World War, the conservative social ideals of the 1950s provided a welcome respite. As behavioral therapy popularized in the subsequent two decades, so too did forms of “conversion therapy” (such as Hadden’s) that sought to “reverse” the effects of homosexuality , including <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jamie-scot/shock-the-gay-away-secrets-of-early-gay-aversion-therapy-revealed_b_3497435.html" target="_blank">more aggressive treatments</a> like electroshock therapy and ice-pick lobotomies.</p>
<p>Change was still happening, though. Kinsey’s empirical studies had prompted other social scientists to research homosexuality in a variety of ways: reviewing published studies and archival data, examining patterns of sexual behavior among non-human species, and comparatively analyzing the social mores around homosexuality across different cultures and societies.</p>
<p>It was in 1957 that psychologist Evelyn Hooker published one of the first and most famous studies that refuted the notion that homosexuality was a psychopathology. It was in the aftermath of Hooker’s findings — and the efficient and powerful political organizing of the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/lgbt/" target="_blank">gay community</a>— that the American Psychiatric Association voted to remove homosexuality from the DSM in 1973. It’s been 44 years since that decision, and certainly, progress has been made to destigmatize homosexuality, and of other mental health diagnoses, too, for that matter. (For clarity, we don’t mean to imply that homosexuality is a mental health diagnosis.)</p>
<p>Nonetheless, let us take note of the fact that there is extreme variation in the acceptance of gay rights across America. Conversion therapy is still happening, though it has been recently banned for minors in California, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington D.C. Critics of conversion therapy highlight that it often relies on abusive practices, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/26/nyregion/new-jersey-jury-says-group-selling-gay-cure-committed-fraud.html?_r=0" target="_blank">both physical and psychological</a>.</p>
<p>In his 2000 congressional campaign, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/30/us/politics/mike-pence-and-conversion-therapy-a-history.html" target="_blank">Vice President Mike Pence famously voiced his desire for the government to defund organizations that “celebrate and encourage” activities that spread HIV</a>. Many gay and transgender folks interpreted this as an affront to their communities. And during President Trump’s campaign, the Republican Party expressed their commitment to the “right of parents to determine the proper medical treatment and therapy for their minor children,” which many believed to be an indirect endorsement of conversion therapy.</p>
<p>Regardless of what government spokespeople say, it is clear that our country’s leadership is seeking to reformulate its social values publicly, through gestures such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/us/politics/devos-sessions-transgender-students-rights.html" target="_blank">rescinding rules on bathrooms for transgender students</a>. As citizens, it’s up to us to continue normalizing all forms of self-expression and markers of identity. As Audre Lorde said, “Your silence will not protect you,” and so it is up to each and every one of us to speak.</p>
