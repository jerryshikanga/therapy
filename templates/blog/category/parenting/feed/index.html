				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever been on the receiving end of the following conversations?</p>
<p>It’s Mother’s Day brunch, Thanksgiving, or the Fourth of July picnic, and a well-meaning person sidles up to ask, “When are you having kids?”</p>
<p>Or worse yet, you’re at a networking event and an acquaintance asks the same. As if inquiring about personal reproductive issues is appropriate small talk, let alone in a professional environment where choices about children are complicated (for women especially).</p>
<p>Discussion about having children is a charged issue that has no place in unsolicited conversation. Not only that, whether they’re child-free by choice, haven’t made up their mind yet, or have experienced heartbreaking issues while trying to have children, asking a person or couple if they’re having kids can be damaging to their mental health.</p>
<p><span id="more-9813"></span></p>
<p>“I wish people knew how hurtful this question is for so many people who obsess over this question themselves,” says Andrea Syrtash, a relationship expert and the founder of <a href="http://pregnantish.com/" target="_blank">Pregnantish.com</a>. “I also wish more people respected the fact that personal news should generally be initiated and shared by the person going through the experience, not by an outsider asking about it.”</p>
<h2>Child-Free By Choice</h2>
<p>For women, “motherhood” isn’t always the end goal of adult life. Thanks to increasing equality — though we still have a long way to go — women can make different decisions about their lives. This may not include children, even within a committed relationship. This is a legitimate life choice, but one that still carries a stigma.</p>
<p>When child-free people are confronted with the “having children” discussion, they may get follow-up questions that imply their choice is invalid. It’s a blow to the self-esteem and mental well-being of the person on the receiving end.</p>
<p>“Being child-free by choice can definitely be a drain on my mental and emotional well-being,” <a href="https://www.angiefsutton.com/being-childfree-by-choice/" target="_blank">Angie Fiedler Sutton</a>, a Los Angeles-based writer, tells Talkspace. “It&#8217;s bad enough that there&#8217;s this constant message in media that &#8216;having children completes you as a person&#8217; — especially for women. But when family members are consistently questioning such a major life choice, it made my own self-worth issues even more shaky.…It also implies that they know my situation better than I do.”</p>
<h2>Still Deciding</h2>
<p>While some folks are resolute in their decisions about having children, it’s not so clear-cut for others. Kids require an 18-year minimum commitment that can, yes, have many blessings and benefits, but also a lot of risk and self-sacrifice. Whether or not to have children can call into question everything from the strength of a couple’s relationship to financial means, responsibilities, personal stability, and life and career goals.</p>
<p>“Can we please stop treating questions about other people’s reproductive plans as a part of polite conversation?” writes Alicia Thompson for <a href="https://themighty.com/2017/06/why-you-shouldnt-ask-people-if-they-plan-to-have-kids/" target="_blank">The Mighty</a>, revealing originally she didn’t want kids and later experienced medical complications when she changed her mind. “You don’t know that I have cried many times about how I feel that I am letting everyone down… You don’t know the conversations, the self-doubt, the confusion I have waded through.”</p>
<h2>Pregnancy Problems</h2>
<p>For others who want children, medical barriers — including infertility, its requisite treatment, and miscarriages — make this option difficult and sometimes even impossible. It’s devastating physically and emotionally for all genders (more on that later). When unknowing bystanders casually ask these people about having children, the result can trigger anxiety, depression, and other difficult emotional experiences.</p>
<p>“It’s very normal to feel upset or anxious when people probe with this question,” Syrtash says. “Infertility is a medical issue for many people who want nothing more than to be parents! Being asked this not only reminds some people of what they don’t have, but may make them feel extra vulnerable or ashamed.”</p>
<p>“When you are having difficulty conceiving, it seems everyone around you is falling pregnant,” Adele Barbaro shared on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheRealMumma/posts/493725484337391" target="_blank">Facebook</a> in 2017. “It’s easy to be happy for them at first but that brave face wears thin after a while. I even started to decline going to certain get togethers and attending baby birthdays were just painful. I became quite bitter, desperate, and depressed.”</p>
<p>“As a woman, having a miscarriage is a devastating experience,” Pamela Granoff Simon shared on <a href="https://medium.com/@pamelagranoffsimon/8-reasons-why-you-should-never-ask-a-woman-if-she-is-planning-on-having-kids-9be38c6695d0" target="_blank">Medium</a>. “Your joyful question with a hopeful expression on your face feels like a knife to the gut; thank you for making me feel even worse about it!”</p>
<p>There can be <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/infertility-mental-health-costs/" target="_blank">many painful reasons</a> that people do not currently have children (or additional children), and asking about it doesn’t help the situation.</p>
<p>Dr. Paul Turek, a male fertility expert and founder of <a href="http://www.theturekclinic.com/" target="_blank">The Turek Clinics</a> in California, tells Talkspace “the impact of infertility… is as profound as having cancer.” Further, the experience can elicit many of the same emotions as such a devastating illness, including “denial, anger, remorse, regret, and guilt.”</p>
<h2>Mental Health for Men</h2>
<p>More often than not, family planning gets framed as a woman’s issue. However, questions about having children for men, especially those who have fertility and reproductive issues, is also harmful to their mental health.</p>
<p>One fertility client revealed on Turek’s <a href="http://www.theturekclinic.com/that-azoospermia-feeling-vasectomy-blogs-high-testosterone-level-men-with-azoospermia-hydrocele-free-testosterone-pe-treatment/" target="_blank">blog</a> that after learning he had infertility issues, “I was in shock and then got really depressed.” Turek recalls that another <a href="http://www.theturekclinic.com/a-year-without-answers-male-infertility-azoospermia-stertility-mapping/" target="_blank">shared</a>, “I ended up as low as you could possibly go, and I almost lost my marriage and my life for that matter.”</p>
<p>“He was just broken,” Turek adds. “It’s not like the pain from a punch, or a pain from losing a job. This is incredibly different because it’s so fundamental to their psyche.”</p>
<p>For men who are faced with the question about having children, they may hide their pain or doubt their entire identity, which can manifest in mental health issues as well as substance abuse problems.</p>
<p>Turek also emphasized that a service like Talkspace, which offers online-based therapy tailored to the needs of clients, may be exactly what can help men find the support they need. “I think the hardest thing for them to do is find a therapist to reach out to,” Turek says, urging the addition of an easy call to action for resources. (<a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_POST_INLINE&amp;utr_adgroup=asking-are-you-having-kids-can-damage-mental-health-heres-why?utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/asking-about-having-kids-can-damage-mental-health" target="_blank">Click here for help, seriously</a>.)</p>
<h2>What You Can Do</h2>
<p>If you’re on the receiving end of the dreaded question about having children, protect your mental health.</p>
<p>Syrtash has personally dealt with these questions by opening up about her struggles with infertility, because “sometimes it feels better to be honest so people understand that it’s complicated.” If that’s uncomfortable, she also recommends responding with a generic line like, “‘We hope to one day and will share news when it’s relevant.’ And then? Change the topic!”</p>
<p>It’s also perfectly acceptable to say things like, “I’m not sure” or even “I’d rather not talk about it.” There’s even nothing wrong with ducking out of events where the question about children is likely to come up. Protecting your well-being and mental health should be the first priority, which can be supported with professional help, for you and your partner, if you are in a relationship.</p>
<p>Most importantly, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/7-self-care-tips-for-when-stress-affects-your-body/" target="_blank">don’t forget regular self-care</a> and to “build a support system or support network for yourself,” Turek advises, with “people you can trust and count on.”</p>
<p>This way the next time the question about having children comes up, you’ll be able to vent frustrations, talk about any emotions that come up, and get validation for all the decisions you make about having children in your life — no matter what they are.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“I’m sorry to say that your test results were negative.”</p>
<p>Moments before the answer, I knew the nurse was about to deliver another bout of crushing news. The tone in her voice and subtle hesitation quietly revealed that despite our best efforts with a <a href="https://www.verywell.com/superovulation-defined-1960103" target="_blank">superovulation cycle</a>, I was still not pregnant.</p>
<p>After the call, I brushed a stray tear aside and went back to my desk to finish the work day, only to release buckets of emotion the moment I slid into the driver’s seat of my SUV to head home.</p>
<p><span id="more-9699"></span></p>
<p>Infertility, like many physical health conditions that have mental health implications, often goes unnoticed by well-intentioned friends, family, and co-workers, yet thousands of couples ride the roller coaster of hope and disappointment each month in an emotional quest to start a family. The<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/infertility/" target="_blank"> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> estimates that one in eight couples have trouble getting pregnant or sustaining a pregnancy. Approximately 7.4 million women – about 12 percent – have received infertility services in their lifetime.</p>
<p>It’s a common problem with far-reaching implications for mental and emotional health.</p>
<h2>Infertility and Relationship Strain</h2>
<p>The infertility journey can wreak havoc on even the strongest relationships. When partners are inundated with appointments, research, and disappointment, frustration can build and bubble over. One partner may blame the other for their physical issues contributing to the infertility, even though infertility issues are split equally between men and women according to the<a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/infertility/conditioninfo/common" target="_blank"> National Institutes of Health</a>. One partner may also feel like he or she is handling the brunt of the work.</p>
<p>And let’s face it, scheduling sex for an ultra-specific window of time to maximize the chance of conception is anything but romantic and exciting. Couples may feel pressured to perform and lose focus of the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/7-truths-about-love-to-remember-this-valentines-day/" target="_blank">unconditional love that serves as the foundation</a> of the act.</p>
<h2>Financial Stresses of Infertility</h2>
<p>Medical diagnoses can come with staggering financial commitments, which can quickly drain your savings. With infertility, insurance coverage varies by state and by plan. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) does not require coverage for infertility treatments, and many couples spend thousands of dollars on specialist consults, medications, and<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/art/whatis.html" target="_blank"> assisted reproductive technology</a>.</p>
<p>With finances noted as one of the<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/insight-is-2020/201212/how-financial-problems-stress-cause-divorce" target="_blank"> leading causes of divorce</a>, financial stress should not be overlooked when navigating infertility. The stress of funding a long medical journey to have a baby is more than dollars and cents – it’s rooted in a deep frustration that new life requires a financial commitment before you even buy your first pack of diapers, while other couples simply enjoy the process and a heftier safety net.</p>
<h2>Loss of a Support Network</h2>
<p>Facing any <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/why-arent-we-talking-about-postoperative-depression/" target="_blank">life-changing challenge or diagnosis</a> can lead you to reassess your surroundings and the people in it. In the case of infertility, living from cycle to cycle and appointment to appointment can quickly separate you from peers who are blessed with normal, healthy pregnancies. Even the closest friends may struggle to relate to your experience and offer unwelcomed platitudes like “it will just happen.”</p>
<p>A changing support network can leave couples feeling isolated and alone. This makes infertility and loss support groups and accessible therapy options like Talkspace more important than ever.</p>
<h2>Infertility’s Anxiety and Depression Risks</h2>
<p>The long road of infertility is marked with daily worries that can drastically impact a couple’s overall mental health. A<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/when-youre-not-expecting/201008/new-research-stress-and-infertility" target="_blank"> study</a> published in the journal <i>Fertility and Sterility</i> noted that the emotional stresses women with infertility face are similar to cancer and cardiac patients.</p>
<p>“I worried I’d never be a mother. I worried I would have a bad reaction to the medication. I worried I’d be unable to keep myself from spending all our savings, gambling for a chance to become pregnant every month. I worried about the size of my follicles or whether I was eating enough protein to make quality eggs,” an anonymous writer admitted in a <a href="https://verilymag.com/2015/11/supporting-a-friend-through-infertility-polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-reproductive-health" target="_blank">Verily blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Without <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/04/infertility-everything-you-need-to-know-to-cope/" target="_blank">proper coping tactics or support</a>, this worry can escalate to anxiety and depression. And women with a past history of mental health concerns like depression are more likely than other infertile women to become depressed during treatment, according to<a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/The-psychological-impact-of-infertility-and-its-treatment" target="_blank"> Harvard Health Publishing</a>. With millions of people already suffering from anxiety disorders and clinical depression, infertility serves as another risk factor.</p>
<h2>Hope for the Future</h2>
<p>As one of the thousands of women who yearn to hold a healthy newborn in my arms, or tend to a restless baby in the shadows of a carefully constructed nursery, I’ve felt both the despair and the cautious optimism.</p>
<p>Infertility is a life-altering journey that requires strength and resilience to address the mental health concerns that arise along the way. But armed with the right tools — a strong mental health foundation — you should be well prepared to weather the emotional turmoil that can accompany infertility and its treatment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Giving birth can be one of the biggest events in a person’s life, and it’s a loaded experience. Everyone has expectations about what a “good birth” looks like, but birth doesn’t always go as planned. For some parents feelings of disappointment, fear, or stress about the events surrounding the birth of a beloved child can transition into something more serious: birth trauma, also known as perinatal PTSD. This condition is a lot more common than you might think.</p>
<p>Our expanding understanding of psychological trauma has highlighted the fact that PTSD is an issue much broader than the emotional aftermath of experiencing combat. Any intense traumatic experience can have psychological ramifications, whether someone has a history of mental health conditions or not, and no matter how well-prepared someone might be. Birth, accompanied with intense physical and emotional experiences, is no exception. But the myths surrounding pregnancy and childbirth can make people uncomfortable when it comes to speaking out, or uncertain about whether what they’re experiencing is normal.<span id="more-8682"></span></p>
<p>“I just kept replaying every moment from when I first started getting contractions to when I gave birth,” Rebekah Sanderlin told Talkspace.</p>
<p>When she gave birth to her second child, she was living far apart from her family while her husband was on deployment. Nearly everything that could have gone wrong did. She went into labor in the middle of a hurricane, had trouble reaching the hospital, and was treated dismissively by hospital staff at intake. While the actual process of labor and delivery went as smoothly as it ever can, and her child was born happy and healthy, the experience haunted her.</p>
<p>Like many people who develop PTSD, Sanderlin became obsessed with ruminating on the series of events surrounding her delivery, feeling “stuck, like a broken record.” When she compared notes with other new parents, she found that they didn’t share her experiences. Nonetheless, it didn’t occur to her to identify the issue as PTSD until much later.</p>
<p>Doctor Mary Kimmel, the medical director of UNC’s Perinatal Psychiatry Inpatient Unit, has considerable experience working with patients who are struggling with complex and unexpected emotions both before and after birth. Flashbacks, like those Sanderlin experienced, are not uncommon, but her patients also have nightmares, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/different-types-anxiety-disorders-classified/" target="_blank">anxiety</a>, hypervigilance, and feelings of being on edge. Sometimes patients arrive with a mix of mental health conditions, including perinatal mood disorders like <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/dealing-depression-need-know/" target="_blank">depression</a> and anxiety. At other times the PTSD presents on its own.</p>
<p>Limited <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1348/014466500163095/abstract" target="_blank">research on this subject</a> indicates it is a very real problem, but the precise number of birth parents who experience it is unclear. Kimmel, however, says it may be as high as 5% of pregnancies. While “trauma” often seems to imply an unplanned, unexpected, scary situation — like an emergency C-section — it can happen in births that are fairly ordinary, too. Kimmel notes that people who feel a loss of control, as though the situation is being rushed and they don&#8217;t have an opportunity to actively participate in making choices, can be at higher risk, especially if a sense of helplessness accompanies that emotion.</p>
<p>That observation is echoed by Katherine Clover, who entered a hospital as a home birth transfer after several frustrating days of painful labor. She ultimately needed a C-section, saying: “It was this very scary sense of having no power or control.” Even as she was supported by hospital staff, the rapid transition in her birth plan left her feeling unmoored.</p>
<p>Clover didn’t identify what she was experiencing until months after the birth, when she sought counseling to help her sift through the complicated emotions that followed her son’s weaning. Coincidentally, she reached a therapist who specialized in postpartum care, something Kimmel says is important.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">Therapy</a> allows you to tell your story and have a place to process that story,” says Kimmel, who adds that she loves her job working with parents and families. In some cases, medication can also help patients get stable so they can take their time with clinical treatments.</p>
<p>Sanderlin and Clover are open about their experiences, with Sanderlin reaching out to new parents to let them know they might experience a mix of complicated emotions. The decision to share stories is somewhat unusual, though. Kimmel says it can be “hard to talk about your birth experience,” especially when you “feel you have all these negative emotions.” In a world where birth is supposed to be a beautiful, spiritual, affirming event, people with perinatal PTSD may feel slightly out of step.</p>
<p>In pregnancy there can be a sense that planning for unfortunate circumstances puts a jinx on the experience. Despite this concern, Kimmel notes that there are some steps people can take to mitigate the risks of birth trauma, and Clover says having a specific mental health plan in advance can be highly beneficial. But it’s important to remember that, as with other mental health conditions, it’s not possible to prevent birth trauma. Even a meticulously-planned pregnancy and delivery experience can’t account for everything.</p>
<p>Kimmel says it can be helpful for parents to work with the local hospital to tour the labor and delivery area and meet the staff there. This preparatory step can make it seem less scary and overwhelming on the day of. That goes for home births, too: If something goes wrong, the hospital shouldn’t feel like an unknown frontier for someone who is already worried and unhappy that a birth isn’t going as planned. Getting a neonatal intensive care unit [NICU] tour can also be helpful. Hopefully it’s a tour of a place you’ll never see again. Nonetheless, knowing what it looks like, what babies who need intensive care look like, and who works there can be an anchor of familiarity at a scary time.</p>
<p>Birth plans can also help expecting parents think ahead and regain some measure of control in chaotic situations.</p>
<p>“We need to do a better job of discussing birth with people, and talking about the things that can happen,” says Kimmel, who says that during her medical training as an obstetrical intern, the process of communicating often felt rushed or poorly timed.</p>
<p>Making sure everyone on the care team is on the same page is tremendously helpful, but so is a frank conversation about what will happen in an emergency. If a baby goes into distress, parents need to have confidence in a medical team that doesn’t have time to explain what needs to happen and why. Patients should be able to think, “I&#8217;m doing my best, I have a team I trust, they’re doing their best,” says Kimmel.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that pregnancy and childbirth are accompanied by intense emotions is also important. Even people without a history of mental health conditions can benefit from therapy during and after pregnancy to talk about what’s happening in their lives. Those who have a history of PTSD, depression, or other mental health conditions — or traumatic events that might be reopened during birth — should specifically have a mental health plan, argues Clover.</p>
<p>“Have a specific plan,” she said. “Have a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a> already.”</p>
<p>She suggests sourcing local phone numbers to call for help and talking with family members about what to do. “Be kind to yourself,” says Kimmel, something Clover agrees with. Birth trauma “isn’t anybody’s fault, but you can get help and there really is no reason to wait.” It’s better to have this information and not need it than to be in distress and not have it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When my sons were little, I would tell them, “You are my left arm and you are my right arm.” Then with one on each side of me, either walking holding hands or snuggling on the couch, I felt whole. Now, as I literally face an empty nest — as I right now stare at the walls and empty chairs of a nearly empty house — I’m enraged at how quaint and inadequate the term is. Empty Nest. It’s more like no arms syndrome. It’s as if the two things that kept me afloat and alive in this cold world are gone. It’s a deep, physical loss. I feel broken, not whole.</p>
<p>When I was thirty-five I thought, this would be the time to have a third child. My sons were seven and five. We were out to dinner, a favorite restaurant, and I looked at my oldest boy, a very precocious, verbal and sensitive child, who I had somewhat of an intense relationship with: we are very alike. I asked him, “If I had another child, I’d pay less attention to you and that might be a good thing, right?” He looked straight into my eyes and gently answered, “You don’t pay too much attention to me. I like how much attention you pay to me.” And that was that. Two sons. My left arm and right arm. I didn’t need a third arm.<span id="more-6931"></span></p>
<p>I am known and rightly so, as a feminist writer, a feminist in general, and am very proud of that. Fierce about it, frankly. But first and foremost, I always wanted to be a mother and was determined to be one. I don’t see this as antithetical, being a feminist and being a mother. As a child I walked around with baby dolls stuck up my dress, pretending to be pregnant. At the age of twenty-five, after being in a relationship for a year, I told my boyfriend, “I love you, I want to marry you and have babies.“ He balked. I broke up with him. Two years later, I was married and pregnant. After I gave birth to my first son, the midwife held him up at me, we stared into each other’s eyes and I said, “You’re here. I’ve known you my whole life. Now you’re here.”</p>
<p>For a decade or so, every summer I’d take my sons to a house upstate near the Delaware river. I’d drive them to a tennis day camp, then I’d go on a run. Afterward, snug back in our house, I’d write, and they’d read, draw, or build legos. We’d have dinner. My life seemed perfect. I was happy. Everything felt right.</p>
<p>My therapist at the time said, “It’s OK that you’re not very social now, but as your sons get bigger, you’re going to need to be more social.” Like always, he was right. But it hasn’t proven easy for me. And being more social doesn’t make up for the terrible loss of one’s children. I know they’re not dead. I know we still love each other. But they are gone. And I’m lost without them.</p>
<p>During those difficult adolescent years, I’d quote a friend of my parents. Children are like boats, he said. If you build a boat and it’s in your basement, you didn’t build a very good boat. If it’s out on the water, moving along, you built a good boat. This past May, as my son packed up to spend the summer in Los Angeles, I was sitting with him, upset, but also making sure he had enough underwear and socks. It was the first summer since he left for college that he’d be away the entire time. I cried. He said, “You and your boat building, Mom.” I protested. “You’re a great boat! You don’t have to leave for the whole summer! You’re a great boat.” And he is. He thrives in college, travels the world, speaks Spanish fluently. But off to Los Angeles he went.</p>
<p>So what does one do when one loses the people that matter most to them? When the arms that held you up are gone? Like after my father died, you just get up and get going, if possible. Some days, it’s almost impossible. Those days, I don’t go to the gym, I don’t answer my emails, don’t do the dishes. Those days, I allow myself to be lost in grief. But other days, I’ve started to do things I never wanted to do, but it turns out they’re good for me. I got my first job in twenty years.</p>
<p>I’m teaching writing to freshmen at a University. I never wanted to teach. I even had an attitude about it. It’s funny how we become the things we never wanted to become. I find teaching very rewarding. I called my sons. They’re were proud of me, as I am proud of everything about them. Astonished, I said, “I’m good at it. My students love me.” My son said to me, “Of course you are! It’s like mothering.” And my heart cracked. My tears welled. And I missed them both so much, I started to shake.</p>
<p>The next day, I got up, got dressed, and went to work. It’s not the same kind of love, but it is love. In whatever form I can express it, I’ll take. It’s sort of like settling, but it’s all I have. I try to be grateful. Fake it until you make it. But pretending isn’t my strong suit. Loss is real and it hurts. Some people hurt more strongly than others. I am the former, and part of being one of those people, the ones that hurt hard, is accepting it. Acknowledging pain, fear, loss, and sitting with it. Wounds are real. They may turn into scars, heal, but scar tissue isn’t like normal flesh. And even though it’s a kind of healing, it can still hurt, pull taught at moments, a constant reminder. I will always miss my sons. Wherever they sail to.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By the time I was 12 years old, I had moved 10 times — more if you count the separate moves my parents made after they split up. My parents were hippies (or beatniks, if you ask my mother), always up for an adventure, and always hoping that a change of place would fix their problems and make them happy.</p>
<p>In certain ways, I see the moves we made when I was a kid as part of a wild, interesting, beautiful ride. But mostly, I hated moving, and I think of the moves my family made as symptomatic of their impulsive, unstable behavior — and at least one of the triggers of my lifelong anxiety and panic disorder.</p>
<p>Melissa Moreno, LCSW-R, a Talkspace therapist, agrees that frequent childhood moves can contribute to anxiety for some children. “Frequent moves can bring up some uncomfortable feelings such as anxiety and impact one’s ability and desire to build and maintain relationships,” she told me. “Some individuals link frequent moves to lower life satisfaction and poorer psychological well-being.”<span id="more-6836"></span></p>
<p>A 2010 <a href="http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2010/06/moving-well-being.aspx" target="_blank">study</a> published in the <a href="http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/psp/index.aspx" target="_blank"><em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em></a> came to similar conclusions. The study looked specifically at the long-term effects repeated moves had once children reached adulthood. The researchers found that the more frequently a child moved, the more likely they were to report feelings of unhappiness and dissatisfaction, as well as fewer quality social relationships overall — and this was even after controlling for factors such as age, gender, and education level.</p>
<p>Of course, this is not an across-the-board phenomenon, and some children thrive despite frequent childhood moves. One of the most interesting aspects of the 2010 study was the researchers’ finding that it was actually the more introverted children who fared worst during frequent moves, and the more extroverted children that flourished.</p>
<p>“Moving a lot makes it difficult for people to maintain long-term close relationships,” said the study’s lead author, Shigehiro Oishi, PhD. “This might not be a serious problem for outgoing people who can make friends quickly and easily. Less outgoing people have a harder time making new friends.”</p>
<p>I have always thought that my introverted, sensitive personality was one of the reasons I had trouble with moving. This was certainly the case as I entered the school-age years and began to form meaningful friendship. As someone who was generally shy, it took me a while to make friends. And then — to have them yanked away from me when we moved — was painful indeed.</p>
<p>Now, as a mother of two sons, I have taken perhaps the polar opposite approach to moving than my own parents did. We have only moved once since my oldest was born ten years ago, and that was only a few miles away to a bigger home, which didn’t interrupt his schooling or his life. However, we may need to move again in a few years, and I have thought long and hard about how to make that transition easiest for each of my children — especially my oldest, who has many of the same sensitivities that I did growing up.</p>
<p>Melissa Moreno was able to offer some wonderful tips for how to make the stress of moving more manageable for children — and I will certainly be putting them to good use when my family moves again.</p>
<h2>Access Individual Needs</h2>
<p>Above all, Moreno encourages all parents to access their individual child’s needs, and to be sensitive to them as the family makes the transition. “Each child and family has different needs and desires and not all transitions are the same so I encourage you to be patient with yourself and your child during this time,” she told me.</p>
<h2>Emotional Prep</h2>
<p>Besides that, she encourages families to do some emotional preparation for the move. Visit the new area you’ll be moving to. Tour the school as well as the neighborhood. Research exciting new things your family might like to do in the neighborhood, including local landmarks, museums, and amusement parks.</p>
<h2>Celebrate Where You’ve Been</h2>
<p>Then, before the move, make sure to commemorate the place you are moving from in some way. For example, you can make a photo or memory book to take along with you. Additionally, have a plan in place so that you will be able to stay in touch with friends. Moreno suggests making plans to Skype with your friends on a monthly basis, or plan to stay in touch via email, letters, or social media.</p>
<p>Once you’ve settled into the new place, getting involved with community activities can help some children acclimate, says Moreno, and staying in close touch with their new teachers as they transition into the new school environment can be very helpful.</p>
<p>Moreno also suggests you point out the valuable aspects of moving whenever possible. “It may be necessary for a parent to point out to their child that there was a lot of value and life lessons in the move such as meeting a new friend that taught them something.”</p>
<p>However, it is also important to acknowledge any difficult feelings your child may be having. “Talk about the feelings that this time period is bringing up and ask for help when it is needed,” Moreno says. “Transitions can be difficult and understanding and talking about these feelings can help your child understand their thoughts and feelings.”</p>
<p>Of course, if your child needs extra help sorting through these feelings, reaching out to a school counselor or therapist might become necessary, and can really help a sensitive child move gently through the transition.</p>
<p>Although I don’t fault my parents entirely, I do wish that I had received a little more hand-holding, and perhaps some psychological help during those frequent moves I experienced in childhood. The good news is that I did eventually get the help I needed, and I’ve had some incredible therapists who have helped me work through much of my childhood instability.</p>
<p>I see now that although I wouldn’t wish my frequent childhood moves on anyone else, there was a kind of resilience that I build up in response to the adversity I experienced — and that resilience is something I am proud of, and which shapes me in powerful, positive ways to this day.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Miscarriage and stillbirth are emotionally intense and very unique forms of grief and trauma, ones that often occur in privacy and silence. For parents eagerly anticipating the arrival of a new family member, fetal death — whether it occurs early or late in pregnancy — can be devastating. The shroud of secrecy that hangs over these topics may make it challenging to talk about, but it’s critical to bring these conversations into the light.</p>
<p>I talked with two experts, Boston-based psychologist Aline Zoldbrod and Doctor Elizabeth Fitelson of Columbia University’s Department of Psychiatry, about the emotional and cultural issues surrounding miscarriage and stillbirth — and how to approach this very distinctive life experience.<span id="more-6821"></span></p>
<p>Fitelson notes that advances in medicine have been a double-edged sword for new parents; neonatal mortality rates are dropping dramatically, and many people think of doctors as able to “fix” whatever crosses their path. The public perception of pregnancy, she says, has changed. It’s no longer a high risk life event for gestational parent and child, but a routine affair, with problems in pregnancy viewed as manageable.</p>
<p>The truth is actually more complicated. More advanced medical care has made it easier to identify and treat problems in pregnancy. But some problems aren’t surmountable. “In a large percentage of pregnancies,” she says, “things simply don’t come together, and miscarriage is the expected outcome.” The silence about miscarriage statistics shapes the way we think about pregnancy and parenting, often to the detriment of expecting parents.</p>
<p>According to the March of Dimes, an organization devoted to neonatal welfare, around <a href="https://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/miscarriage.aspx" target="_blank">10-15 percent</a> of pregnancies end in miscarriage, with pregnancy loss before 20 weeks gestation. The real number may be much higher, as some pregnancies quietly end before people are even aware they’re pregnant. While the relatively common nature of miscarriage doesn’t make it less tragic, it does highlight that this experience is not exceptional, and parents facing miscarriage are far from alone. Stillbirth, death after 20 weeks, is far less common, occurring in less than one percent of pregnancies — but given the number of pregnancies across the United States in any given year, that’s a tremendous number of people facing an intense emotional experience.</p>
<h2>Why Miscarriage Is So Hard to Talk About</h2>
<p>Given that miscarriage is relatively common, I asked Fitelson, why is it so hard to talk about?</p>
<p>Those medical developments, she says, come with added burdens, like extremely accurate pregnancy tests that can identify a pregnancy very early, and advanced diagnostic and medical imaging techniques to go with them. That has many parents identifying closely with a fetus from the start, which makes a loss more intense — and it’s compounded, she says, by the increasing involvement of nongestational parents (ie, the parent non carrying the child) in pregnancy. These aren’t bad things, and parents shouldn’t be afraid to get excited about and connected to a pregnancy, but the feelings can intensify the sense of loss.</p>
<p>She comments that the traditional wisdom of not announcing a pregnancy until after the first trimester — when the risk of miscarriage drops dramatically — can have unintended consequences. If parents never announce a pregnancy, they may have difficulty announcing its loss as well. “It leaves women isolated because they haven’t actually shared,” says Fitelson, making it awkward to announce both a pregnancy and a bad outcome at the same time.</p>
<p>“Because miscarriage isn’t talked about a lot, women’s expectations are that everything’s going to be fine,” she adds, highlighting the danger of viewing pregnancy as routine. Many of her patients don’t just experience grief. They also feel guilt and shame, wondering if they did something wrong or somehow caused the pregnancy loss. “It’s a very difficult feeling to have, when it’s completely not the truth.”</p>
<p>For some expecting parents, a miscarriage can feel like a loss of a child, but that child occupies a strange liminal space outside the family. While parents may be anticipating a baby, thinking about what they might look like and what kind of person they’ll grow up to be, outsiders to the relationship never meet a baby, and never form an attachment. Outside of scattered ultrasound photos, the child is an abstraction, which can lead to harsh comments, even if they’re well meaning.</p>
<p>Parents may hear: “Well at least you know you can get pregnant,” “it just wasn’t meant to be,” “they’re in a better place now,” or “you can always try again” instead of an expression of sympathy and shared grief. “Many people minimize it,” Zoldbrod comments. “It’s incredibly traumatic.” That lack of validation can make parents hesitant to reach out and be frank about their experience.</p>
<p>It’s hard for nongestational parents, too. While they don’t experience the physical and hormonal changes of pregnancy, and the sensation that another human being is growing inside them, they also form an attachment. Many nongestational parents are highly involved in pregnancies as active participants, but when it comes to pregnancy loss, friends and even family may not understand how emotional the experience can be. Fearing lack of compassion, people may grieve silently and in private.</p>
<h2>Coping With the Emotional Aftermath of Miscarriage</h2>
<p>Fitelson comments that anxiety, depression, and stress can all accompany miscarriage, and for gestational parents, these emotional responses may be intensified by the rapid hormonal change that accompanies pregnancy loss. Their bodies have been preparing physically and hormonally for an event that doesn’t happen, and for people who are “extremely sensitive to hormones,” she says, that can result in an emotional crash.</p>
<p>These feelings, she stresses, are valid: A miscarriage is a loss, whether parents view it as the loss of a baby or the loss of potential. For parents who have been struggling to get pregnant, it can be accompanied by more complex feelings, including, potentially, grief for prior lost pregnancies. Grief may spill over from other aspects of life — people may be processing the deaths of loved ones, or major life changes, and the grief can start to feel overwhelming.</p>
<p>“There are no rules,” Fitelson says, for grief and recovery from miscarriage and stillbirth. Every person responds to trauma in their own way and at their own pace. For friends and family members, respecting and validating that grief is very important. Acknowledging the grief and treating miscarriage and stillbirth as real losses create a safe space for people to talk about their experience.</p>
<p>Taking time to grieve is also important, including, if possible, time off from work. Some people find it helpful to travel — or to throw themselves into projects — while others like to spend some private time. For those experiencing stillbirth, the opportunity to hold the baby, take photographs, and keep mementos like footprints or hair clippings, can be incredibly valuable. Organizations like Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep offer volunteer photographers to memorialize a stillbirth, and even if parents aren’t ready to look at those photos right away, they may be treasured in the future.</p>
<p>Among her patients, she notes, once people start talking about miscarriage and stillbirth, it’s common for friends and family to come out of the woodwork with stories of their own. Hearing that others have gone through the experience can help people work through grief and find commonality — and attending a miscarriage or stillbirth support group can be very beneficial. Community organizations, birthing centers, hospitals, and mental health professionals often offer pregnancy loss groups and may divide by gestational age so people can connect with parents who know how they feel.</p>
<p>“The most important thing for women who miscarried,” says Zoldbrod, “is to join a miscarriage support group. In a miscarriage support group, people understand your pain. Another really terrible thing about miscarriage — or being infertile — is the unbelievable envy one feels when one sees pregnant women&#8230;in a miscarriage support group, no one will tell you you’re going to hell for having those feelings.”</p>
<p>Sometimes, support of friends and family isn’t enough. There’s cause to worry when grief starts to interfere with people’s lives, and when they have trouble going about their day. If someone appears to be suicidal, or is contemplating self-harm, it’s especially critical to get outside help. But therapy can be helpful even when people aren’t feeling like their grief is out of control — talking to a professional in a safe setting can help people unpack and process grief, with or without a partner. And it’s not about “getting over it,” but moving forward.</p>
<p>Miscarriage doesn’t have to be the subject of silent stigma and shame, but that’s a process that begins one person at a time. Being frank about pregnancy loss can reduce the sense of feeling alone, while affirming the validity of grief can help parents feel more comfortable grieving with their community, rather than doing so in isolation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting out of an abusive relationship is one of the most difficult obstacles single moms can face. Summoning the courage and tenacity to walk away when they have no clue what the future will hold takes gall and serious faith.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is hope on the other side. Leaving an abusive relationship is only the beginning. Here are five ways to begin the journey of healing to help you not only survive, but thrive.</p>
<h2>1.Talk to Someone</h2>
<p><a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_BOTTOM&amp;utr_adgroup=bottom-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=6721" target="_blank">Get professional help</a>. Sharing your story is one of the most crucial ways to heal productively after surviving relationship violence. Although the hurt and shame of it may continue to feel like a dark cloud over your head, one way to lessen the pain is to regain control and own your own story.</p>
<p>Sharing with close friends and family members is a start, but going to a licensed professional is much better. A <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">psychotherapist</a> trained in relationship trauma is prepared to offer a safe space as well as an objective disposition. His or her job is to guide people through pain while they are on the road to becoming their whole, healed selves. It is powerful to work with someone whose primary duty is to listen and help dissect the truth. Communicating with a person capable of supporting you in the <a href="https://esme.com/resources/content/domestic-violence/overcoming-self-doubt-after-abuse" target="_blank">journey of healing</a> while sharing tools of empowerment can make a world of difference.<span id="more-6721"></span></p>
<h2>2. Invest In Yourself</h2>
<p>Choose a creative hobby or learn something new. Chances are that in the midst of a toxic relationship <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jenni-bevill/five-signs-that-youve-los_b_8271000.html" target="_blank">you lost touch with yourself</a>. Who were you before this relationship took you out of your element? What did you do for fun? What were you passionate about? It’s possible you may not remember. If that’s the case, this is a great time to get to know yourself.</p>
<p>To fully know your worth, try spending some time figuring out who you are and why you’re here. Coming into a strong sense of purpose and self-worth creates a standard that makes it nearly impossible for anyone to treat you poorly or without respect.</p>
<p>How do you get in touch with yourself? A great way to start is by journaling. See what words and feelings come to mind when nobody’s around. What do you care about? What makes you happy/sad/angry? What kind of life do you envision for yourself and your children?</p>
<p>Next, maybe create a vision board. Choose images that resonate with you. It doesn’t matter what they are, as long as they speak to you. Add some affirmations: “I am enough.” “I deserve happiness.” “I will create a life I love.” Read some personal-development and self-help books to spark inspiration or motivation. Develop a personal library to return to time and again when you need a little pick-me-up.</p>
<h2>3. Create Distance from the Abuse by Changing Your Environment</h2>
<p>A change of scenery invites a breath of fresh air, psychologically speaking. It’s possible that flashbacks of horrific incidents show up at the most inconvenient times.</p>
<p>If moving is not an option for you, try making some small changes in the form of DIY projects. Maybe paint the walls a color you love. Perhaps a slipcover for your sofa, fresh linens, or maybe even a few potted plants would do wonders to lift your spirits. Grab a bundle of sage to burn and clear out negative energy, if you’re into that sort of thing. If moving is an option, it’s a great chance to create a loving and welcoming space for you and your children to dwell in.</p>
<h2>4. Join a Community of Survivors</h2>
<p>If there is ever a time to connect with other women, it’s now. Sometimes those we love and feel closest to aren’t able to relate to our situation.</p>
<p>Family and friends who know you can sometimes be a hindrance to your healing. They usually mean well, but they have a history with you. It can be second nature for them to offer unwelcome advice. Because they likely know and have spent time with the partner who abused you, their feedback might include the all-too-familiar, “I told you so.”</p>
<p>Someone who has walked in your shoes can most likely offer a safe, judgment-free space, and a fresh perspective. Recovering emotionally from trauma can create feelings of intense shame and isolation, and combating those feelings alone could prove extremely difficult. Meeting new people who might be empathetic could do wonders for your heart. This gives you a chance to make new friends without having to explain everything you’ve gone through.</p>
<p>Even if making new friends isn’t on your agenda, consider meeting regularly with a support group. Listening to other people’s stories can provide clarity and validation for what can be a very muddled haze of feelings about your past. The act of gathering gives you a reason to get out of the house regularly and can be empowering.</p>
<h2>5. When You’re Ready, Give Back</h2>
<p>Giving back can take many forms. Providing hospitality to someone else in need could be a wonderful experience if you’re up for it. Be mindful of your own needs first, though. Create healthy boundaries, and know that doing something like this is always optional.</p>
<p>Sharing your story is another way to give back. If you want to help another woman overcome similar obstacles, opening up about your struggles could be a wonderful way to do it.</p>
<p>By the time you feel ready to step up to the challenge of supporting others, you will have learned how resilient you are and how much you have to offer the world. Your voice will start to emerge. By empowering others, you will feel empowered. Keep in mind that you must first be healed enough to share the story and insight without feeling triggered.</p>
<p>Nothing about the journey of recovering from abuse is easy, and it won’t happen overnight. Allow time to heal. Be willing to do the emotional work of uncovering the pain that’s been buried deep.</p>
<p>You deserve the chance to heal and know what it’s like to be fully free. Moving past old habits to learn new ones is highly important.</p>
<p>Above all, be kind to yourself. Being a victim of abuse does not define you. That part of your past is only a small chapter in the big book that is your life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I remember the transition to college as one of the most emotionally challenging times of my life. I wanted all the freedom and intrigue I knew college could offer me, yet I still felt very much like a child. Suddenly being out on my own felt jarring.</p>
<p>I was not alone, according to Amanda Rausch, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT). Rausch says the transition from home life to college life isn’t easy for most college kids. In fact, explains Rausch, the transition can be experienced like a series of losses for your college-bound child.</p>
<p>“They leave their home, regular schedule, high school relationships, and even pets they have grown up with…it is a lot to process!” Rausch also mentioned the huge decisions young people are responsible for during college. “They experience the adjustment of being on their own, figuring out finances, new classes, new people, new places and, oh yeah, the decision of what to study, which determines their career and the rest of their lives!”<span id="more-6553"></span></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this amount of upheaval can lead to mental health issues for college students — especially because, as Rausch points out, college is not exactly a place where self-care is practiced on a regular basis. “It can be hard to eat right, work out, and get enough sleep,” she says. “Also, relationships in college are quick to form and become intense very fast&#8230;and relationships that begin quickly, can end quickly. So there are many factors that exacerbate or even cause mental health issues.”</p>
<p>As Melissa Fenton, writer and mother of four rightly points out, the model for dealing with new and difficult emotions in college isn’t often the healthiest one. “Typically young adults this age, especially if they&#8217;ve never experienced feelings like that before, will ‘treat’ it with alcohol or other illegal substances,” says Fenton. “Their knee jerk reaction is NOT to go to the student counseling center, but to numb them in a way that is not only easily accessible, but for the most part, totally acceptable — because everyone drinks in college, right?”</p>
<p>All of this can be extremely stressful for parents, and it is normal to feel like you want to do everything in your power to help your children. The goal, of course, is to help your child learn how to be independent, and not rely too heavily on parental involvement to solve problems. But on the other hand, you don’t want to leave your child in the dark, especially if you become concerned your child might be facing a mental health issue.</p>
<h2>Tips For Supportive Parents</h2>
<p>So what’s a parent to do, and how can a parent strike a good balance of letting go, but also being appropriately involved?</p>
<p>Rausch has some helpful pointers.</p>
<p><strong>1. Ask questions, but keep them simple</strong></p>
<p>Parents can ask questions to access their child’s mental health without being too “nosy.” Ask how their classes are going. Ask if they are making friends, and if they are eating well. Look for personality and mood changes. You know your child well, and even surface-level phone calls usually help you glean whether something is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>2. Be available, but let our child call the shots in terms of how frequently to communicate</strong></p>
<p>Parents might want to maintain daily contact and communication with their kids, but it’s important to remember that college life is different than life back home, and you might need to give your child more space than you are accustomed to. You can make it clear to your child that you are available, but it is probably best to let your child decide how often to communicate. And remember that most kids these days prefer texting over phone calls. Don’t worry: texting counts too!</p>
<p><strong>3. Follow your child on social media to get a sense of how they are doing</strong></p>
<p>It doesn’t need to be “stalking” per se. But sometimes pictures are worth a thousand words, so checking in on your child’s social media accounts can give you a sense of whether or not they look well and happy.</p>
<p><strong>4. If you suspect your child is dealing with a mental health issue, visit them</strong></p>
<p>If you suspect your child is dealing with a mental health issue, you may need to visit them to get the full picture. So do it if you can. It is always better to be safe than sorry, especially if you believe your child may be in the middle of a mental health crisis.</p>
<p><strong>5. Help your child locate mental health care options nearby</strong></p>
<p>Remember that your child is a relatively “new” adult, and may need intervention to get necessary help. If your child is dealing with something like anxiety or depression, the mental health issue itself might be enough to stop them from being able to locate a mental health professional. Your child’s college should have mental health facilities, but if there is a long wait list, for example, you might need to help find your child outside professional help. It’s always good to present your child with more than one option so they feel like they have some say in the matter.</p>
<p>More than anything, you want to make it clear to your child that you are there to help. It can be hard not to get too emotionally bent out of shape if your child is suffering, but as much as possible, you want to be clear that you are not judging them for the emotions they are experiencing. Let them know it is normal for college students to find the adjustment difficult, and that they are not weak or “crazy” for feeling the way they do.</p>
<p>“The key is prevention, rather than crisis intervention whenever possible,” says Rausch. And while you can’t guard your child against every mental health issue that might crop up, honoring your child’s feelings and offering helpful resources can go a long way in helping to prevent any mental health issues from becoming exacerbated.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my 20’s, I diligently tended to my mental health. I went to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a> weekly, exercised daily, and journaled all my thoughts and feelings. This all did wonders to help me manage my anxiety and panic disorder.</p>
<p>Then, at 28, I had a baby, and to say that things began to slide in terms of my mental health care routine would be a huge understatement.</p>
<p>I think it’s natural and necessary for parents to push their needs aside when they have children. At first, I found motherhood all consuming, the power of the love for my child like nothing I had ever experienced before. That feeling that you would literally lay your life down for your child is real and not an exaggeration for most of us parents.</p>
<p>And beyond those primal feelings of love and protection, parenthood is a 24 hour job, the needs of our children — especially when they are young — endless and unrelenting. And with parents stretched so thin in terms of finances, childcare, and general support, it is understandable that so many of us end up putting our needs at the very bottom of the list.<span id="more-6318"></span></p>
<p>The thing is, neglecting our mental health is a critical misstep, not just for our own sake, but for the sake of our children. For example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2724169/" target="_blank">studies</a> have linked maternal depression (which affects up to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/features/maternal-depression/index.html" target="_blank">1 in 9 women</a>) to developmental and cognitive delays in children. And although many of us might not realize it, a dad’s mental health issues can have a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/swr/article-abstract/41/2/85/3100342/Similarities-and-Differences-in-the-Influence-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank">significant and lasting effect</a> on his children as well.</p>
<p>And yet, mental health care is often not just at the very bottom of most parents’ lists, but often simply nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>All parents know the importance of taking their children to the doctor for check-ups, and even the busiest parents will go to the doctor for themselves if something is bothering them physically. We diligently schedule our “date nights” or “girls’ nights out.” We believe that tending to our physical health, our social lives, our personal grooming, and household chores are still essential, even after we become parents.</p>
<p>But so many of us parents flat-out neglect our mental health. It’s not just the stigma surrounding therapy and other mental health care, or the fact that many of us think we just don’t have the time (although both of these are certainly factors at play).</p>
<p>We think it’s common, acceptable, and even necessary for parents to feel stressed. Normal to feel desperate, harried, and exhausted to the bone. We have normalized (and perhaps even glorified) it to such an extent that many of us don’t even realize it when we are suffering from something like <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxiety</a> or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a>.</p>
<p>Even as a lifelong anxiety sufferer, I spent the first few years of parenting pretty much in denial that my anxiety symptoms had stuck around, and were actually starting to get completely out of control (thanks to those lovely hormonal shifts and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/sleep-deprivation-hurts-mental-health/" target="_blank">sleep deprivation</a>, which are both pretty much recipes for disaster to anxiety sufferers).</p>
<p>I stopped seeing my <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a> soon after my first child was born because I thought I would just tough it out. I thought there was something almost valiant in that. And goodness knows I was certain I didn’t have time to make it to my appointments anymore.</p>
<p>The truth is I wasn’t prioritizing my mental health anymore, and by the time my son was two-and-a-half, I was in the middle of a full blown anxiety breakdown, my panic attacks perhaps worse than they’d ever been. I was lucky that it was fairly easy to work with my old therapist again, and was able to much feel better within a year or so.</p>
<p>But it was at that time that I became painfully aware of how very easy it is for us parents to brush aside our mental health needs. Even those of us who once understood the importance of therapy and other methods of self-care can easily fall prey to the notion that mental health care isn’t necessary for parents.</p>
<p>Now I’m a bit of an advocate for parents to take their mental health seriously—as seriously as they address their physical health, their finances, their careers, and their parenting. We need to take it seriously for ourselves, but also for our children. Even beyond any studies out there that show how profoundly our mental health affects our kids, I think we all know on an instinctual level how quickly children absorb the emotions of everyone around them.</p>
<p>Yes, in ways our children are more resilient than we realize, but they are more vulnerable than we might like to think, especially when it comes to how they are affected by the people who they rely on most.</p>
<p>None of us are perfect parents. But children don’t need perfect parents. They need parents who make an effort to prioritize what is most meaningful and necessary in life, both for their kids, and for themselves. Most importantly, they need parents who can learn from their mistakes, and are able to show their kids what it means to seek help, heal, and feel better.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Parenthood can be difficult whatever your life circumstances are, but these days, parents seem more over-extended than ever, and stressed to their maximum capacities.</p>
<p>As a result, mental health issues among parents are common. We know that about <a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/women/resources/reports/postpartum-depression.aspx" target="_blank">1 in 7 mothers</a> are at risk of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/tag/postpartum-depression/" target="_blank">postpartum depression</a> (and that a growing number of fathers are as well). If untreated, PPD can last for months, or even years. But even beyond the earliest phase of parenthood, mental health disorders abound. Many parents I know battle loneliness, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxiety</a>, and off-the-charts <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/stress/" target="_blank">stress</a> and exhaustion.</p>
<p>Very few, however, seek help for these problems.</p>
<p>For most parents, the idea of going to a therapy session for treatment of something like anxiety or depression feels like an impossibility. I know it did for me, for many years. A lifelong anxiety sufferer, I’d been in <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">therapy</a> for 10 years before I became a parent. My anxiety was relatively under control, and when I experienced a brief bout of postpartum anxiety when my first child was born, I brushed it off, thinking it was the usual “just me being anxious.”<span id="more-6185"></span></p>
<p>So I “sucked it up,” and battled my anxious demons on and off for the first 10 years of parenthood. I was a stay-at-home mom to young children for most of that time. Our budget was shoe-string tight, and we had almost zero outside childcare. It felt like a feat for me to even fit in a shower — how would I ever make it to a therapy appointment?</p>
<p>But when my oldest turned 10, and started showing anxiety symptoms of his own, I realized it was time to take my mental health seriously. How could I be the mother I wanted to be for my children if I was spending so much energy fighting off my own demons?</p>
<p>At this point, I was also a part-time working mom, and so the idea of having to fit in a weekly appointment with a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">therapist</a> felt like even more of an impossibility. That’s when I heard about <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/" target="_blank">online therapy</a>. A friend was singing its praises over <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/social-media-use/" target="_blank">social media</a>, and it seemed to be like maybe I’d found my answer.</p>
<p>Of course, I was skeptical at first. I was a believer in “talk therapy” — it had saved me in more ways than one in my 20s. Would online therapy offer me that same level of intimacy, security, and connection?</p>
<p>I knew I needed to do something — anything — so I dove right in. I picked <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/" target="_blank">Talkspace</a> because it was HIPPA compliant, and employed licensed therapists. I loved that <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/unlimited-messaging-therapy/" target="_blank">therapy could be done via messaging</a>, with the option of live video sessions (that to me, meant that I could have the element of traditional talk therapy if needed).</p>
<p>A few months in, and I would say that online therapy truly is the godsend I hoped it would be. I even recommended it to my husband, so that he could address some of his work-stress. He finds it invaluable as well.</p>
<p>I think it’s an option that all busy parents should consider. It’s therapy that can be done from a smartphone, maybe even while your kids are playing under your feet. It’s therapy that doesn’t care if you’ve rocking a baby in your arms, or if you’ve taken a shower that week. It’s therapy you can do on the train ride home from work, or while eating your lunch.</p>
<p>It’s therapy that fits into your life with kids, rather than takes away from it.</p>
<p>The fact is that many parents tend to ignore their mental health. It’s understandable: after all, they have the next generation of children to nurture and raise, and that’s hard work. And our modern life doesn’t allow much time for self-care: many parents simply don’t feel that something like therapy is feasible, or that they should make it a priority.</p>
<p>But taking care of our mental health is everything; a whole and well parent is maybe the greatest gift we can give to our children. Online therapy is a simple, portable, streamlined way for parents to take care of their mental health “on the go.” And it may be just what the doctor ordered.</p>
