				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>I’m a terrible person.</i></p>
<p><i>My sister is so beautiful and I’m so ugly.</i></p>
<p><i>My boyfriend is the most attractive person I know and I’ll never be as into anyone else again.</i></p>
<p>We all think of the world in black and white terms at times. From refusing to see the flaws in our loved ones, to being overly hard on ourselves, the human brain’s <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/darwins-subterranean-world/201601/black-and-white-thinking-in-our-social-worlds" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">tendency </a>to understand the world in either/or terms has a profound effect on our relationships.</p>
<p><span id="more-10489"></span></p>
<p>The official psychological term for black and white thinking is “splitting.” At its extremes, splitting can be a symptom of mental illness like <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/09/borderline-personality-disorder-impacts-relationships/" target="_blank">Borderline Personality Disorder</a> (BPD). In everyday settings, it can simply hold us back from experiencing some of the richness of our lives and relationships.</p>
<p>Of course, the world is not an either/or place: Our lives are full of shades of gray. By seeing the world in black and white — rather than the complex rainbow it actually is — we may initially make it easier for ourselves to separate out good from bad, right from wrong, and beautiful from ugly. But this kind of thinking can be exhausting, sending us through constant ups and downs. And on a deep level, simplifying things into easy, binary terms robs us of much of the complexity that makes life and relationships so rich.</p>
<h2>Ways Black and White Thinking is Holding Your Back</h2>
<p>Does this line of thinking sound like yours? If it does, here are some ways black and white thinking may be holding you back — and why it’s worth embracing life’s shades of grey.</p>
<h3>1. Black and white thinking can negatively impact your relationships</h3>
<p>Your partner is the most wonderful person in the world — until they’re the worst. This cycle of love/hate, down/up, good/bad can be seriously stressful for any relationship. In some cases, these wild lows and highs can be a sign of something more serious than black and white thinking, like <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/abusive-partner-promises-change/" target="_blank">abuse</a>, for which you deserve support. But in the context of otherwise <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/guide-setting-healthy-boundaries-relationships/" target="_blank">healthy relationships</a>, black and white thinking can impact your comfort with each other and prevent a deeper bond based on acceptance.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/when-does-family-drama-become-toxic/" target="_blank">family relationships</a> and friendships too, quickly changing from thinking a loved one is perfect to feeling they’re awful can erode intimacy and trust. By seeing your loved one as either all good or all bad, you’re not letting yourself see them for what they <i>are</i>: a normal, fallible human just like you.</p>
<h3>2. It can hurt your self-image</h3>
<p>All of us have wondered if we’re “bad people” or “<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/good-person-borderline-personality-perspective/" target="_blank">good people</a>.” In reality, most of us are somewhere in between, with both bad and good qualities. When you think in black and white terms, however, you risk being overly self-critical or refusing to see your faults.</p>
<p>Black and white thinking can make you hypersensitive to others’ opinions and make it difficult to accept criticism without deep insecurity. That can prevent you from genuine growth and self-compassion.</p>
<h3>3. It can hold you back from success</h3>
<p>Like all aspects of life, work will have good days and bad days, and many days that are somewhere in between. But if you think in black and white terms, it’s easy to internalize every failure and have an unrealistic expectation of every success. As Tim Chaves <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2018/04/04/how-black-and-white-thinking-can-kill-your-business/#478f6095fe0f" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">writes for <i>Forbes</i></a>, black and white thinking in our professional lives can make us abandon projects as mere bumps in the road, due to a feeling that they are inevitably doomed to fail.</p>
<p>When we acknowledge that our professional lives, like every other aspect of life, are complex and may have pluses and minuses, we enable ourselves to learn and grow toward success.</p>
<p><a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/online-therapy-with-a-licensed-therapist?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_MID&amp;utr_adgroup=midpost-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=10489&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/black-white-thinking-ways-poisons-your-perspective/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4880 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png" alt="affordable blog purchase CTA" width="660" height="240" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png 660w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p></a></p>
<h3>4. It can literally change how you feel</h3>
<p>According to psychological <a href="https://www.pomona.edu/news/2016/10/12-%E2%80%98black-and-white%E2%80%99-thinking-changes-how-you-feel" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">research</a>, thinking in binary terms can actually change the way we perceive the world, effectively conditioning us to miss nuance.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797616661555" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2016 study</a>, Pomona college researchers found that participants’ perceptions of how someone was feeling changed depending on whether they were given black and white, or more fluid categories, to understand emotion. By conditioning you to see things in more binary terms, black and white thinking can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, making it even harder to perceive nuance.</p>
<h3>5. It can signal a deeper problem</h3>
<p>While everyone experiences black and white thinking to some extent, extreme black and white thinking can also be a symptom of mental illness. People with <a href="https://themighty.com/2017/03/borderline-personality-disorder-what-is-black-and-white-thinking/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Borderline Personality Disorder</a>, for example, experience intense black and white thinking, which can in turn <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/30775645/coifman_et_al_2012_-_final.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1532465511&amp;Signature=iKN4fIgsKrCd5Et%2FYUBL9HAq9cg%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DFrom_Negative_to_Positive_and_Back_Again.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">affect their perceptions</a> of their relationships with others and with themselves.</p>
<p>While black and white thinking itself doesn’t mean you have Borderline Personality Disorder or any other mental illness, it’s definitely worth seeking out a therapist if you’re having a difficult time or feel distressed in any way because of it.</p>
<h2>How Can I Leave Black and White Thinking Behind?</h2>
<p>As with many self-defeating thought patterns, the first step beyond black and white thinking is simply to acknowledge that you’re doing it. This can be hard — after all, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/in-practice/201301/50-common-cognitive-distortions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">cognitive distortions</a> can make our thought processes, well, distorted — but taking time to consciously examine your thoughts and question extremes can help.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.practicingmindfulness.com/black-and-white-thinking/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">simple exercise</a> involves thinking of binary or extreme words you might use to describe a person, relationship, or situation (bad/good; ugly/beautiful) and then imagine more nuanced ways to describe situations. It can also help to actively cultivate empathy.</p>
<p>For example, if you think your sister, who just hurt you, is a completely awful person, it may be useful to take a moment, pause, and ask yourself <i>why </i>she might have done what she did. And of course, it’s always <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank">helpful to see a therapist</a>, whether brick-and-mortar or online, who can help you address troubling thought processes or cycles.</p>
<h2>Balanced Thinking Means a Richer Life</h2>
<p>Black and white thinking can give us a measure of security. After all, who doesn’t want to think they have all the answers? But it can also cut us off from the complexity and richness of life.</p>
<p>Allowing ourselves to venture into uncertainty is, paradoxically, a way to see more clearly: not in black and white or even gray, but in complex, dazzling rainbow.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Katie Reed, <a href="https://www.amotherthing.com/">a blogger</a> and mom of four from Salt Lake City, spent many years living with “quiet” borderline personality disorder before getting a proper diagnosis. Before that, she was misdiagnosed repeatedly — with bipolar disorder, Asperger&#8217;s syndrome, and anxiety disorder — none of which ever felt “right.&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more-8894"></span></p>
<p>It was after her third suicide attempt in 2009 that she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD), a diagnosis that thankfully changed her life for the better.</p>
<p>“When I was finally diagnosed with BPD, it was like a light went on, and I suddenly understood what was going on in my brain and why I acted the way I did,” Reed tells <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/talkspace-online-therapy-licensed-ecounseling/id661829386?mt=8" target="_blank">Talkspace</a>.</p>
<h2>What is “Quiet” Borderline Personality Disorder, and How Does It Differ From Classic Borderline Personality Disorder?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/borderline-personality-disorder/index.shtml">The National Institute of Mental Health (NIH)</a> describes borderline personality disorder (referred to most often as BPD) as marked by erratic mood swings, poor self-image, impulsive behavior, extreme “black-and-white” thinking, self-harm, and an inability to maintain stable relationships. Episodes of heightened anger, depression, or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/when-does-normal-anxiety-become-a-mental-illness/" target="_blank">anxiety</a> are another hallmarks of the disorder. These episodes can last for a few hours to a few days.</p>
<p>While there is no known, clear cause for BPD, experts believe a combination of genetics, brain structure and function, as well as environmental and social issues come into play. Many therapists point to a history of childhood trauma or abuse as a root cause of the disorder.</p>
<p>“Quiet” BPD isn’t readily distinguished from &#8220;regular&#8221; BPD—at least not in an official sense (it does not have a special designation in the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> [<i>DSM</i>], for example). And yet, therapists and their patients often see a clear distinction between the “quieter” cases of BPD and its more traditional manifestations.</p>
<p>While “classic” BPD is characterized by episodes of violent outbursts, individuals with “quiet” BPD tend to direct this violence inward.</p>
<p>“[T]hose with ‘quiet’ borderline personality disorder act in,” says Dr. Gerard Lawson, President of the <a href="https://www.counseling.org/">American Counseling Association</a>. “There is less hostility and fewer aggressive outbursts, but there may still be isolation, and self-injurious behaviors or suicide attempts.”</p>
<p>People with “quiet” BPD will still experience the intense emotional roller-coaster than distinguishes the disorder, but will often be working harder to shut these emotions down, or push them aside. Very often, their sense of self is marked by shame or self-hatred.</p>
<p>“People with BPD often feel that their emotions are ‘wrong’ and spend a great deal of energy either pushing their feelings down or trying to justify [them],” explains Jessica Tappana, LCSW, therapist and owner of Aspire Counseling. “Whether you react by withdrawing (&#8220;quiet&#8221;) or acting out, the emotional desperation of BPD&#8230;can feel unbearable.”</p>
<h2>How is “Quiet” Personality Disorder Diagnosed?</h2>
<p>Reed has always experienced BPD as an “inward experience.” There was very little “acting out,” and much of her intense emotions resulted in intense periods of self-harm.</p>
<p>“My rage and sadness are usually internalized, and my frustrations are directed inward. My arms are criss-crossed with scars in various degrees of healing from years of self-harm (cutting),” Reed explains. “I also tend to deal with upset by cutting myself off from those I love, becoming robotic in my interactions, refusing to allow empathy or sympathy in. It has affected every relationship I’ve ever had.”</p>
<p>Because people with the with “quiet” form of BPD don’t exhibit the classic explosive symptoms of the disorder, it can take much longer to get a proper diagnosis, which is particularly troubling when the symptoms of the “quiet” disorder involve self-harm.</p>
<p>“I think people who have more internalized symptoms aren&#8217;t diagnosed at all,” says Dr. Colleen Cira, Licensed Clinical Psychologist and the Founder and Executive Director of <a href="http://ciracenter.org/">Cira Center for Behavioral Health</a>. “Borderline Personality Disorder has such a reputation in the psychological community as presenting as angry, manipulative, explosive.”</p>
<p>Dr. Cira explains that while there are symptoms of the “quiet” form of BPD listed in the <i>DSM</i>, they are often overlooked when evaluating a patient, making it more difficult for patients to get a proper diagnosis. “This is a real problem because not only do these people need treatment to address their BPD symptoms, they also likely has trauma histories and need treatment to address their trauma histories as well,” she says.</p>
<p>Patients who have not been properly diagnosed with “quiet” borderline personality disorder often end up feeling “invisible” and “misunderstood,” says Dr. Cira, which only makes the disorder harder to live with, and leads to more episodes of self-harm and lower self-esteem.</p>
<h2>Treatment (and Hope) For People With “Quiet” Borderline Personality Disorder</h2>
<p>Getting a proper diagnosis for a “quiet” version of BPD tends to be half the battle.  When patients find out the name for what they&#8217;ve been living with, it can be like a huge weight is lifted from their shoulders.</p>
<p>“I have felt far less crazy since getting my diagnosis because now I know what I am dealing with,” says Reed.</p>
<p>The good news is that treatment options for “quiet” BPD have increased over the years, as the disorder becomes better understood. Once patients get a diagnosis, there are several evidence-based treatments out there.</p>
<p>“Not so long ago (15-20 years) some very skilled clinicians believed there was no help for individuals who have a disorder like BPD,” says Dr. Lawson. “Now, there are actually very good treatment options, and they are improving.”</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-Conditions/Borderline-Personality-Disorder" target="_blank">National Alliance of Mental Health (NAMI)</a>, psychotherapy is the recommended treatment, with Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and Mentalization-Based Therapy (MBT) topping the list of treatment methodologies.</p>
<p>DBT is the therapy of choice for therapist Jessica Tappana, who has used it frequently to treat “quiet” borderline personality patients in her practice. It’s an intensive treatment with four components: individual therapy, group DBT skills training, coaching throughout the week, and weekly meetings with your consultation team. But its comprehensive nature is what makes it so successful, according to Tappana.</p>
<p>“DBT does more than treat the symptoms of quiet BPD, it teaches you a new way to interact with the world around you,” she says.</p>
<p>Whatever method you use to treat “quiet” BPD, it is important you find a therapist that you feel comfortable with. “Quiet” BPD is something many will struggle with on and off for the rest of their lives. But treatment can lessen the symptoms significantly, and decrease the number of “episodes” patients experience.</p>
<p>Since getting diagnosed and entering treatment, Reed says she has far fewer episodes “Thankfully, as I’ve gotten older, I’ve been able to manage my illness better,” Reed shares. “It used to be several times a week that I would have ‘episodes’ but nowadays it is far rarer — once a year or so at most.”</p>
<p>Most importantly, Reed is now able to recognize what is happening to her, and work through it with a little more compassion and self-love. Reed openly writes about her experiences with mental illness <a href="https://www.amotherthing.com/depression-suicide-love-and-redemption/" target="_blank">on her blog</a>, and considers herself an advocate for people with the disorder.</p>
<p>Reed’s hope for the future is that more people suffering with “quiet” BPD can get the treatment they need to live life to the fullest. “It&#8217;s a really important subject to share with people and help them understand,” she says.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben learns he is not allowed to take personal calls during business hours at his new job at a strict government agency. His supervisor gives him an emergency number so family members can reach him when absolutely necessary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news immediately fills him with dread. Ben’s daughter, Lisa, has borderline personality disorder. She calls him a few times a week, often while he’s at work. A supportive and understanding father, Ben was happy to chat with her at his old office where there were no limitations on phone calls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now he has to inform his daughter that their mid-week check ins will need to be less frequent and occur only in the evening. With noticeable reluctance, he provides the emergency number to Lisa.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-6766"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day Lisa dials the number during Ben’s lunch break. Before picking up, Ben already knows who it is and what is going on. Lisa is fine. There is no crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben tries to suppress the frustration in his voice, but Lisa can hear how upset he is. She simply wanted to make sure he would pick up if she was in trouble. She doesn’t get what the big deal is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben is frustrated. He shouts. He is already wilting under the glare from a supervisor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lisa snaps. The love she has for her father is no longer on her mind, as if it it had never existed at all. Intense indignation takes its place. She screams. Threatens to harm herself, makes him feel guilty for long-past wrongs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She hangs up. The dial tone ringing in Ben’s ears, he panics about what she might do next.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lisa’s relationship with her father is actually one of the healthier ones she has. Nonetheless, she is still struggling to manage the </span><a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/borderline-personality-disorder/index.shtml#part_145387" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">symptoms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a difficult, often misunderstood mental health condition, often characterized by an inability to control anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben and Lisa’s story illustrates a few aspects of how borderline personality disorder [BPD] tends to impact relationships. Even for those closest to a BPD sufferer, it can be difficult to remain compassionate and patient in the face of such volatile behavior. By learning more about the condition and watching out for common relational dilemmas, both sufferers and their loved ones can take steps toward building healthier bonds.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing Boundaries</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People with borderline personality disorder tend to have trouble understanding and respecting boundaries. Like Lisa, they often push limits. Psychologist Daniel S. Lobel, Ph.D. and author of “</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/When-Your-Daughter-Has-BPD/dp/1626259569" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Your Daughter Has BPD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” mentioned some common examples he encountered in his work:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Borrowing clothing from family members and roommates without asking</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking cash from wallets of family members</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not respecting boundaries around sleep</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asking about intimate details that are not appropriate to discuss</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because those afflicted with the mental illness often do not instinctively grasp social restrictions, loved ones need to establish detailed boundaries and enforce them without exception. Even when family members and romantic partners of people with BPD are tired and tempted to yield to a request that violates a rule, they need to be resolute. One successful breach of boundaries can lead to the idea that sufferers can get whatever they want by being persistent, according to Lobel.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Desire for Codependency</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people naturally want a level of independence and autonomy in their relationships. Borderline personality disorder, however, fosters </span><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/09/are-you-in-a-codependent-relationship/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">codependency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a situation where one person in a relationship relies on the other for the vast majority of their needs and desires. People with BPD often derive their sense of worth from how much other people are serving them, Lobel said. It is easy for sufferers to conflate self-reliance with abandonment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the primary beliefs within BPD is, ‘I, alone, am not worthy,’” said therapist Melissa O’Neill, Director of Program Development at </span><a href="http://www.timberlineknolls.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Timberline Knolls Residential Treatment Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This line of thinking can contribute to a pattern of short, intense romantic relationships that often become toxic. It is common for romantic partners to have little education on borderline personality disorder. This lack of awareness makes them less likely to be considerate and able to handle stressful behavior. Ironically, people with BPD often seek relationships to cope with the pain of their symptoms.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Splitting: Love or Hate, Black or White </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who live with BPD have a predisposition for a mindset called “splitting” where they fluctuate between viewing people as either entirely good or evil. Rather than experiencing shades of grey, sufferers perceive relationships as black or white. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://themighty.com/2016/12/splitting-borderline-personality-disorder-bpd/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">her article for The Mighty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Sarah Cooper, who had recently been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, described her experience with splitting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can get consumed in my anger toward people,” she wrote. “All my memories with that person become tainted, bad and wrong. Just thinking of them fills me up with anger.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opposite reaction can occur as well. Borderline personality disorder can cause people to feel unbridled love or infatuation, to regard someone as an infallible savior. This dichotomous nature can make maintaining relationships exhausting.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming Malicious Intent</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Borderline personality disorder often makes the afflicted feel as if everyone is trying to hurt them. Benign actions and words can seem like insults and threats. These assumptions of hostility can make people with BPD shift rapidly from pleasant to aggressive, said </span><a href="https://www.marriagecounselingboulder.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">therapist Dr. Wyatt Fisher</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. What appears to be the intention to punish and be cruel might actually be a defensive reaction that originated from fear.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">High Likelihood of Past Relational Trauma</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abuse and neglect during childhood are common contributors to the development of borderline personality disorder. Most sufferers have traumatic relationships before they are diagnosed with BPD. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While not everyone who experiences relational trauma develops BPD, all people I have known or worked with who have had BPD have also had relational trauma,” said </span><a href="http://mybestrelationship.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">therapist Jenev Caddell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the people who were supposed to care for them inflicted great pain, it can be challenging for victims of childhood abuse to build healthy relationships. BPD exacerbates this problem.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-Harming/Suicidal Behavior and Threats</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Borderline personality disorder increases the likelihood of using self-harming behavior to cope with emotional pain. Those living with BPD are more likely to threaten suicide when they are angry with friends, family members, and romantic partners.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How People Can Cope</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have borderline personality disorder, consider a range of mental health treatments, including dialectical behavior therapy and mindfulness. BPD is more difficult to treat than most other mental illnesses, so be patient with yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who are close with BPD sufferers, remember that it is an illness. Acknowledge the pain and suffering those with BPD endure every day. Set strict boundaries and do not waver. If someone with BPD hurts you, know that they most likely did not intend to. Even when the relationship becomes horribly stressful, try to be kind and compassionate. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As with many types of traumatic or mental disorders, certain criteria must be met to receive a diagnosis. Following the structure of these guidelines is meant to allow for an accurate and unbiased determination. However, when it comes to the differentiation between Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), the question of whether men and women are diagnosed differently has been raised.</p>
<p>According to NAMI, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, <a href="https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-Conditions/Borderline-Personality-Disorder" target="_blank">an estimated 1.6% to 5.9% of adults in the U.S. have BPD</a>. And of those actually diagnosed, 75% were women, despite the fact that men are just as likely to display symptoms. A non-profit organization, PTSD United, found that roughly 8% of Americans have PTSD. Additionally, <a href="http://www.ptsdunited.org/ptsd-statistics-2/" target="_blank">1 out of 9 females</a> in the U.S. have PTSD, while the rate for males is about half that. These statistics alone call for us to question whether there is a divide in diagnosis based on gender. Before we can safely address the issue of gender, though, it’s important to look at the symptoms and characteristics that are used to diagnose both Borderline Personality Disorder and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.</p>
<p>For a mental health professional to diagnose a patient with BPD, they must display at least 5 of the <a href="https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-Conditions/Borderline-Personality-Disorder#sthash.clNofmOp.dpuf" target="_blank">qualifying symptoms</a>. These include unstable <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/relationships/" target="_blank">relationships</a> altering between idealization and devaluation, frantic efforts to avoid social abandonment, a distorted self-image that affects emotional stability, impulsive behaviors, suicidal and self-harming behavior, periods of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a>, irritability, or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxiety</a> that last between a few hours to a few days, chronic boredom or feelings of emptiness, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/anger-emotions-run-life/" target="_blank">uncontrollable anger</a>, and dissociative feelings. Most psychological research indicates the causes are genetic, environmental (from the experience of a traumatic event), neurological, or a combination of the three.<span id="more-6127"></span></p>
<p>When it comes to PTSD, an even hardier list of qualifications must be met to receive a diagnosis. There are qualifying traumatic events like death, serious injury, or sexual violence that a patient must either have experienced themselves or been a witness to. Then, there are <a href="https://psychcentral.com/lib/symptoms-and-diagnosis-of-ptsd/" target="_blank">four sets of symptom types</a>, that include a variety of symptoms: re-experiencing the event through memories, flashbacks, or nightmares; avoidance of thoughts, feelings, people, or situations connected to the traumatic event; negative alterations in mood or cognitive functions, including negative thoughts, distorted sense of blame, and feelings of detachment or isolation; and, lastly, increased arousal symptoms like difficulty concentrating, irritability, and hypervigilance. In addition, these qualifying symptoms must have lasted for at least a month. Causes of PTSD are correlated to the experience of a traumatic event, not pre-existing genetic susceptibility or neurological disorders.</p>
<p>This opens up the discussion of whether men and women are diagnosed with either BPD or PTSD differently, according to gender. While, statistically speaking, women are about twice as likely as men to meet the criteria for PTSD, the <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/09/borderline-personality-disorder-impacts-relationships/" target="_blank">symptoms of BPD</a> are often looked at as stereotypically feminine behavior. For example, while men are viewed as non-emotional and prone to anger, these traits in women may seem abnormal (based on the societal construct of how each gender is supposed to act) — and women are diagnosed accordingly. Speaking to this disparity, some studies have found that doctors are <a href="https://www.borderlinepersonalitytreatment.com/borderline-personality-disorder-women.html" target="_blank">more likely to diagnose women with BPD</a>, even if a male patient is exhibiting the exact same symptoms. The male patient would, instead, be more likely to be diagnosed with PTSD, or treated for alcohol or substance abuse.</p>
<p>The theory of sexual abuse and its impact on whether a diagnosis of BPD or PTSD is given also plays a large role in addressing the gender divide. Women are more likely to both experience and report rape or sexual assault than men are. It’s perhaps this lack of reporting and willingness to seek psychological help that skews the statistics. We have <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/04/talkspace-ceo-oren-frank-on-mental-health-care-innovation-curing-the-american-nightmare/" target="_blank">society</a> to blame for this; the gender roles prescribed to males can make them feel like seeking help is a sign of weakness. Historically, soldiers who were diagnosed with PTSD were discharged from the military because of this very perception. Women are also expected to be more emotional, or “<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/history-hysteria-sexism-diagnosis/" target="_blank">hysterical</a>,” making it easy for a doctor to misdiagnose their symptoms, based solely on what is perceived as normal or acceptable behavior.</p>
<p>The types of traumatic exposure play a large role in addressing the gender divide. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/03/meet-our-therapists-a-series-nicole-amesbury/" target="_blank">Therapist Nicole Amesbury</a> said, “Gender division can be seen in PTSD and BPD in the presentation, comorbidity, and types of trauma exposure. There are differences in the type of trauma exposure that men and women experience. For example, rape carries one of the highest risks for developing PTSD and only .7% of men report rape, as opposed to 9.2% of women in the United States. Because the genders present with differing trauma — and rape occurs more to women and is underreported by men — we see societal differences in gender that create a division in diagnosis. Even whether or not someone will seek help aligns along this gendered division.”</p>
<p>Amesbury went on to say, “In addition, men and women present symptoms differently. In both PTSD and BPD men are more likely to present with irritability, impulsivity, explosive aggression and/or a comorbidity of substance abuse disorders, while women are more likely to show emotional numbing, self-harm behaviors, and/or a comorbidity of eating disorders.&#8221;</p>
<p>If men, particularly soldiers — who are just as likely to exhibit symptoms of BPD as women — are instead given the incorrect diagnosis of PTSD, the scope of treatments becomes limited.</p>
<p>Similarly, women who have PTSD and are diagnosed with BPD may not receive an effective treatment plan. This, of course, doesn’t address the fact that <a href="https://www.verywell.com/having-both-ptsd-and-borderline-personality-disorder-2797510" target="_blank">BPD and PTSD sometimes go hand in hand</a> — having one diagnosis when both are present creates a dichotomy that can leave the condition wholly untreated.</p>
<p>The importance of an accurate diagnosis not based on gender is critical. The path to getting there, however, may not be as simple.</p>
<p>First, we, as a culture, must stop using language and stereotypes that presents females as hysterical, emotional beings who are socialized toward co-dependency. We need to dismantle the stereotype that men are supposed to be strong and shouldn’t need to ask for help, as well as the notion that they don’t show their emotions (but, somehow tend toward anger more than women).</p>
<p>Second, doctors and psychiatrists must eliminate the idea of gender from their methods of diagnosis. It simply shouldn’t be a factor when there are entire criteria guidelines that can be applied, instead.</p>
<p>Diagnosis based on gender is harmful and decreases the likelihood that men and women, alike, will receive the treatment they need.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Throughout Mental Health Month, we are focused on ways to empower individuals to “light their way” to better mental health, happiness, and improved well-being. As part of this celebration, we profiled “Mental Health Warriors,” individuals who have been outspoken in their advocacy and support for mental health issues. We caught up with famed NFL wide receiver, mental health advocate, and founder of Project 375, Brandon Marshall.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Talkspace:</strong> You have been open about sharing your experience with having Borderline Personality Disorder. Thinking back, at what point did you realize you had an issue?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon Marshall:</strong> It wasn’t until I was a young adult that I realized something was off. I had made it to the NFL, but my life had become a living hell. After living in my own hell for six years, I finally sought help and ended up at McLean Hospital in their outpatient program. I spent three months there and that’s where I received the diagnosis of BPD. Once I got the diagnosis, I started doing Dialectal Behavioral Therapy as well as some <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-how-is-it-conducted-online/" target="_blank">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</a>. It was the most phenomenal experience and it changed my life.<span id="more-5850"></span></p>
<p><strong>TS:</strong> How has therapy been a tool in helping you manage BPD?</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> BPD is really complex. It can manifest itself in hundreds of different ways, but it’s also one of the most treatable disorders out there — if you get the right help. So for me, those months at McLean Hospital were huge. I learned so much about myself and was able to get back on track.</p>
<p>Now my therapy is on an as-needed basis. But I know now who I am and what I need. For instance, I know that <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/03/reconciling-religion-and-therapy-why-you-can-talk-to-god-and-a-therapist/" target="_blank">faith</a> and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/finding-inner-peace-mindfulness-5-senses/" target="_blank">meditation</a> are really important to me. And so is a good environment — being surrounded by healthy people who understand me, validate me, and support me.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note that you’re never cured. You can learn to manage it, though. I know when something is off or when I’m having a bad day. When this happens, I know what I need to do. I now have the tools and skills to self-regulate.</p>
<p><strong>TS:</strong> You’ve co-founded <a href="https://project375.org/" target="_blank">Project 375</a>, a nonprofit devoted to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/stigma/" target="_blank">busting stigma around mental health</a> and helping facilitate care for those in need. How did you go from a BPD diagnosis to founding a mental health nonprofit?</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> It was easy for me. I think we all have a purpose and half of our lives are spent searching for that purpose. It was at McLean that it was revealed to me. I was halfway through the program when I realized that this is why I’m here. I am here to help bridge the gap in the mental health community. That’s also when I realized that football was only my platform, not my purpose. My purpose is to help kids and those who suffer.</p>
<p><strong>TS:</strong> How did stigma affect you before your diagnosis?</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> Before my diagnosis, if you were to ask me what mental health meant, I would have said it’s mental toughness. I was on the other end of the spectrum at the time, where I thought the right way to handle issues was to keep them in, to mask them, to never show your weaknesses. But in reality, the way you get healthy is to open up and be vulnerable to others and yourself. So I finally realized I was doing it all backwards.</p>
<p><strong>TS:</strong> What message do you have for kids who have been diagnosed with a mental illness?</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> You are not your diagnosis.</p>

<p><em>This piece is part of our <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/tag/darkest-day/" target="_blank">Darkest Day series</a>, a collection of stories from people who’ve made it through the worst of their illness and now light the way for others. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LightYourWay?src=hash" target="_blank">#LightYourWay</a></em></p>
<p>Am I a good person? It’s a question we all ask ourselves from time to time, but for people with Borderline Personality Disorder, it carries special significance.</p>
<p>As someone living with BPD, I’ve heard all sorts of negative comments about those dealing with the condition: we’re manipulative, angry, selfish, unable to empathize, incapable of maintaining long-term commitments — the list goes on. While it’s true that many people with BPD do exhibit some of these qualities at various times, they don’t describe all of us, at all times.</p>
<p>I’d love to say that I’ve never exhibited any of these qualities, but BPD, like most mental health disorders, exists on a sliding scale of severity. It’s a spectrum, one that changes depending on the amount of pressure being applied.</p>
<p>I’ve never been under as much pressure as I was in 2014. My second marriage fell apart in February (seemingly overnight, but was actually the result of many years of neglect and denial). In the weeks that followed, I enjoyed a tryst that ended horrendously (another story for another time). Then, on a rainy April afternoon, I found out I was pregnant with my fourth child (I’d spent the two years leading up to that moment on a waiting list to get my tubes tied).<span id="more-5772"></span></p>
<p>Everyone expected that I would get an abortion. Even my ex told me in no uncertain terms that having another child would “kill me.” The excruciating decision of whether or not to keep that child nearly tore me apart. I decided to keep her, only to find out when my pregnancy went public that everyone thought I’d cheated on my husband and gotten pregnant with someone else’s kid, and this was the reason our marriage fell apart.</p>
<p>Manipulative, angry, selfish, unable to empathize, incapable of maintaining long-term commitments—those are just some of the words I heard about myself that year. In fits of self-loathing, I even used them on myself a few times.</p>
<p>Such broad generalizations only perpetuate the stereotypes and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/stigma/" target="_blank">stigmas</a> attached to a complicated disorder. Even if someone with BPD does exhibit these traits, they need our support not our judgement.</p>
<p>Judgement. That’s the word that began my transformation from someone who was truly losing my mind into someone on the path to recovery.</p>
<p>We all pass judgements daily, most of the time without even realizing it. We judge the people around us, the situations we observe, even inanimate objects.</p>
<p>There is literally no end to the amount of judgements you can (and probably do) pass throughout your day, let alone throughout a lifetime. In <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/finding-inner-peace-mindfulness-5-senses/" target="_blank">mindfulness</a> training, you become aware of these judgements and learn to simply observe your surroundings without judging the people, objects, and situations within it.</p>
<p>For someone with BPD, judgement is an invisible cloud of constant negativity that can set off a chain reaction of overwhelming negative emotions. It can also aggravate co-occurring disorders like <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a> and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxiety</a>.</p>
<p>As I learned about my disorder and became more aware of myself, I discovered that I am constantly making judgements about my surroundings. It was important for me, therefore, to try to become a more positive, less judgmental person.</p>
<p>Now, whenever I think negatively about someone or something, I try to turn that negative into a positive. I take it even a step further, sometimes saying my positive thoughts out loud by giving someone a compliment. It doesn’t matter if they’re a complete stranger – everyone loves a sincere compliment.</p>
<p>It might not be precisely what mindfulness teaches, encouraging its practitioners to judge their surroundings as neither positive nor negative, but it’s a step in the right direction for me.</p>
<p>I used to think that my judgmental first instincts defined me as a <em>bad person</em>. I’ve come to learn that it merely defines me as <em>human</em>. I’ve learned that we are not defined by our thoughts or our disorders — we’re defined by our actions as individuals.</p>
<p>Yes, we all make mistakes. We all do things from time to time that others might judge negatively. But I am willing to emphatically state now that I am a good person. It took almost everything I had to ignore the judgements of others and take back control of my life.</p>
<p>No matter who you are or what your disorder, always remember that it takes true strength of character — real work — to turn a negative into a positive.</p>
