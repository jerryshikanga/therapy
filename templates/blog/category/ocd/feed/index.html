				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s a regular Tuesday evening when I realize my Talkspace therapist, who consistently answers twice a day, didn’t respond a second time that night. A fleeting thought darts through my head: “What if she died?” With my life-long history of obsessive-compulsive disorder, I am no stranger to such macabre thoughts, so I dismiss it. It’s just a thought without evidence.</p>
<p>Soon the thought pops back into my mind. I open the Talkspace app on my phone. No message, but it’s probably nothing. I answered her too late in the day, she’s busy, she’s taking a well-deserved night off, her app isn’t working…All reasonable explanations.</p>
<p>Not two seconds later, the thought’s back, and even with all my years of therapy and an arsenal of coping skills for moments just like this, that thought grabs me hook, line, and sinker. I launch into a full-blown panic, which eventually proves to be unfounded when my therapist messages me as usual the next morning.</p>
<p>Does this anecdote sound familiar? It’s just one example of obsessive thinking, and I’m confident we’ve all had a version of this experience at some point. These types of thoughts are unhelpful at best, and debilitating at worst.</p>
<p><span id="more-9992"></span></p>
<p>“Rumination can be a problem because it rarely offers new insights or solutions on how to handle a situation,” writes <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/">psychotherapist</a> Jodee Virgo for <a href="http://theeverygirl.com/5-tips-to-stop-obsessive-thinking/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Everygirl</a>. “Instead it emotionally hijacks us and intensifies our negative feelings.”</p>
<p>Preach.</p>
<p>To stop obsessive thinking in its tracks, with our without the often-associated compulsions, here’s what you can do.</p>
<h2>Anxiety: The Anatomy of an Obsessive Thought</h2>
<p>Obsessive thinking is a series of thoughts that typically recur, often paired with negative judgements. Many times there is an inability to control these persistent, distressing thoughts and the severity can range from mild but annoying, to all-encompassing and debilitating. These thoughts can be unflattering self-judgements such as “I’m not good enough,” to worry over small details like forgetting to turn off the oven or lock the door, to more serious ruminations such as fear of falling fatally ill or hurting loved ones.</p>
<p>Obsessive thoughts can impact both your mood and functioning. When they enter our mind, generally our first instinct is some level of discomfort, followed by attempts to banish the unwanted visions. This is human nature: When something is bad, we avoid it. The stove is hot, so we don’t touch it. Simple. But obsessive thinking is a different beast.</p>
<p>When we try to avoid a thought while in an obsessive state, the brain keeps reminding us about the unwanted thought so we don’t forget to stop thinking about it. It’s the same basic principle behind being told not to think about something — say a pink elephant — and our next thought becoming exactly what we are not supposed to think about.</p>
<p>The secret is that like all thoughts, what we’re ruminating over has no meaning by itself. As <a href="http://www.oprah.com/spirit/how-to-stop-anxiety-and-obsessive-thoughts-deepak-chopra/all" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Deepak Chopra</a> says, “Thoughts are just fleeting mental images. They have no consequences until you choose to make them important.”</p>
<h2>Give It A Name: Intrusive</h2>
<p>To stop obsessive thinking in its tracks, it’s important to identify these thoughts in the first place. Seems simple, but it’s a little trickier than it sounds.</p>
<p>“We have to recognize our patterns before we can change them,” says Virgo. “Often when we are stuck in a cognitive loop, we engage in a well-established habit. It’s similar to biting nails or checking social media every few minutes — it happens unconsciously. The next time you catch yourself ruminating, think: ‘Stop!’”</p>
<p>From here, name the obsessive thoughts. Try writing them down so, as Bruce M. Hyman and Cherry Pedrick write in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/OCD-Workbook-Obsessive-Compulsive-Harbinger-Self-Help/dp/1572249218" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><i>The OCD Workbook</i></a>, you can “examine these thoughts [to] understand how they’re triggered and how you’re currently responding to them.”</p>
<p>Once they’re out of your mind, try to identify the underlying cause of the thoughts to gain some perspective. If it’s a worry about not getting a text response from a friend, or a potential mistake made on a test, search for the root issue. Not getting a message back could be, “I’m upset about how my friend treated me the last time we met.” Anxiety about a test might be, “I’m afraid of failing this class.”</p>
<p><a href="http://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_medium=CPC&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_MID&amp;utr_adgroup=midpost-cta&amp;utr_id=190006000600160630000002&amp;WPpost_id=9992&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/how-to-stop-obsessive-thinking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4880 size-full" src="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png" alt="affordable blog purchase CTA" width="660" height="240" srcset="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable.png 660w, https://www.talkspace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green_affordable-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a></p>
<h2>Battle Negativity by Practicing Acceptance</h2>
<p>The next step to stop obsessive thinking is acceptance. Remember that thoughts are just thoughts — a series of neurons firing in the brain, nothing more. As we learn to accept obsessive thoughts, we’ll have a much better chance of stopping them altogether.</p>
<p>“The resulting effort to avoid, suppress, or escape these thoughts unwittingly serves to amplify and strengthen them, making them worse and worse,” advise Hyman and Cherry. “Acceptance, rather than control and avoidance, is the key. By ‘acceptance,’ we don’t mean giving up or resigning,” but rather as their client said, “When I let the thoughts be, they let me be.”</p>
<p>To accept obsessive thoughts, plant yourself firmly in the present and be realistic about what you do and do not have control over.</p>
<p>“When you find yourself obsessing about the past or worrying about the future, ask yourself the following question: ‘Can I do anything about this right now?’” says Jodee Virgo. “If the answer is yes, identify what you can do and do it.…If the answer is no, do your best to accept what is.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Meditation And Mindfulness</h2>
<p>Partly why obsessive thinking feels so uncomfortable is due to the icky emotions that accompany intrusive thoughts. While you work to cognitively challenge ruminations by naming and accepting them, using meditation and mindfulness exercises can help quell the resulting negative emotional responses.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-is-2020/201612/stop-obsessing-or-fixating-fast-cognitive-technique" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><i>Psychology Today</i></a>, Psychologist Seth Meyers defines mindfulness as “clearing your head and focusing on how your mind and body feels in the moment.” To achieve this, mindfulness and meditation offer a series of practices to reorient us to the present moment, place, and time, which soothes anxiety.</p>
<p>When obsessive thinking enters the scene, try deep breathing exercises by breathing in slowly to the count of four, hold the breath for a count of four, and then exhale for another count of four. Grounding exercises can also help break the rumination cycle. Anchor yourself in the present by focusing on the feeling of your feet planted on the ground. Take in your surroundings with all your senses, identifying in turn five things you see, hear, smell, taste, and feel to get into “right now.”</p>
<p>A quick internet search can identify other <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/good-mental-health-12-therapist-approved-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mindfulness and meditation</a> activities to try. Also consider attending in-person meditation classes to learn different techniques in a supportive environment with others.</p>
<h2>For Heavy Duty Obsessions</h2>
<p>Obsessive thinking is a normal part of human nature, but it can also be the hallmark of a variety of mental illnesses, particularly obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a range of other anxiety disorders.</p>
<p>If you find yourself struggling with disturbing and persistent obsessive thoughts, or just want a little extra boost to manage obsessive thinking, <a href="https://get.talkspace.com/text-therapy/?utr_source=Blog&amp;utr_campaign=BLOG_CTA_POST_INLINE&amp;utr_adgroup=how-to-stop-obsessive-thinking&amp;utr_baseurl=www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/how-to-stop-obsessive-thinking/">reach out to a mental health professional</a>.</p>
<p>“If ruminative thoughts are interfering with living the life you want to live, consider reaching out for help,” says Virgo.&#8221; <a href="http://talkspace.com/online-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Therapy</a> is a great way to learn how to use these techniques with the help and guidance of a professional.”</p>
<p>Our minds are a powerful place, and once we get the hang of stopping obsessive thinking by naming and accepting the thoughts, practicing mindfulness, and getting extra help when needed, we free up space to create something truly amazing for ourselves.</p>
<p>“The greatest power we have is the power to create reality,” says Deepak Chopra. “The essence of wisdom is to see that there is always a solution once you realize that the mind, which seems to create so much suffering, has infinite potential to create fulfillment instead.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ll never forget how my life with OCD began.</p>
<p>I’m lying on the bottom bunk of the bed my grandfather made, surrounded by stuffed animals and my well-loved blue blanket. I close my eyes in the dark room and carefully fold my hands together, placing them above my head. I begin my nightly ritual.</p>
<p><span id="more-9416"></span></p>
<p>It starts with a prayer, listing my mom, dad, brother, grandparents, cats, rabbit, all my family, and asking for them to be safe. I repeat this list over and over until it feels “just right.” Then I can move onto the next section, where I ask forgiveness for my sins and ask for help to be a better person, repeating the phrase in a manic hushed voice in my head until it’s “right.” Then comes the tricky part — the Lord’s prayer.</p>
<p>I have to say it at least two times in a row exactly perfect, but I can never say it a total of three times, ever. So if I mess up the first one, I have to say it twice in a row perfectly again, but that’s a total of three attempts, which isn’t allowed, so I have to say it also a fourth time, but I always have to say two exactly in a row perfectly. This night I mess up the first two tries. I keep repeating the words, tripping over “our daily bread” and “debts and debtors.”</p>
<p>If it’s not perfect I will be punished. My parents will die. My pets will die. My grandparents will die. Some nights I promise I will read 10 chapters out of the bible if my dad gets home safely from work. I count the cars that go by looking for “signs” from the universe that things will be OK.</p>
<p>I must use the same fork every night, even volunteering to set the table daily just to make sure it’s at my place setting. If I don’t have the fork with the bamboo pattern on the handle then something terrible will happen. Every step of my 10-year-old life is a measured set of obsessions and compulsions.</p>
<p>When I finally get to therapy at age 21, it becomes obvious very fast that I have <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/different-types-anxiety-disorders-classified/" target="_blank">obsessive-compulsive disorder</a>, but to me, it all seems normal. Little did I know I had a treatable mental health disorder — that’s just how I always was. In retrospect, I wish I had known much sooner that my dysfunctional anxiety and resulting behaviors weren’t how other people experienced the world.</p>
<p>Turns out though, wondering or not knowing the difference between OCD and more common worries is a question many people find themselves asking.</p>
<h2>What Is OCD?</h2>
<p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder is identified by two parts: intrusive thoughts and images, followed by repetitive behaviors to neutralize the anxiety of unwanted thoughts. These repetitive behaviors, or compulsions, only temporarily relieve anxiety, which locks a person into a constant cycle of unpleasant obsessive thoughts followed by compulsive actions to try and manage the heightened level of anxiety.</p>
<p>For example, a person may fear contamination will lead to contracting a deadly illness. As a result, they may wash their hands repeatedly to alleviate the discomfort of the obsessive thoughts, to the point their hands became red and cracked. Compulsions aren’t limited to washing. They can also include checking, such as making sure a door is locked many times before leaving the house, counting, seeking constant reassurance, and hoarding, among others.</p>
<p>According to Bruce Hyman and Cherry Pedrick in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/OCD-Workbook-Obsessive-Compulsive-Harbinger-Self-Help/dp/1572249218" target="_blank"><i>The OCD Workbook</i></a>, an estimated 2.5 percent of the U.S. population lives with a form of OCD. Typically the onset occurs before the age of 25 and rarely after 35. Indeed, OCD is one of the most common mental illnesses in children, and it’s the “fourth most common psychiatric diagnosis” overall. Due to the stigma and shame that often accompany OCD — many sufferers realize their actions are illogical but still can’t stop — <i>Forbes</i> columnist <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kavinsenapathy/2016/10/11/the-truth-about-millions-with-real-obsessive-compulsive-disorder/#226a7a892e50" target="_blank">Kavin Senapathy</a> found that on average it takes someone 7 to 10 years before they seek help.</p>
<p>To complicate matters, nowadays, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/pop-culture-impacts-mental-health-treatment/" target="_blank">“I’m so OCD” is thrown around regularly as a cultural catchphrase</a>, which only makes people wonder: When do actions such as straightening out the silverware or checking and re-checking a text message before sending it cross the line into OCD? When does anxiety about a child’s welfare go from a common parental concern to something more? What is the difference between OCD thoughts and behaviors and everyday worries?</p>
<h2>How To Tell If Your Thoughts Are OCD</h2>
<p>Dr. Debra Kissen, <a href="http://www.lightonanxiety.com/" target="_blank">Light on Anxiety</a> clinical director and chair of the <a href="http://www.adaa.org" target="_blank">Anxiety and Depression Association of America</a> Public Education Committee, says the easiest way to spot OCD is “when the behaviors start to interfere with regular life” and when the thoughts and behaviors seem to take on a life of their own.</p>
<p>Someone with OCD who worries about forgetting to turn the oven off, for example, may not be able to check it just once. They will likely have to go back repeatedly, which can take minutes to hours until the anxiety reduces enough that the person can move on to their next activity. If the cycle continues, anxiety about the oven can take so much time that a person is late for work or decides not to leave the house at all.</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Diagnostic-Statistical-Manual-Mental-Disorders/dp/0890425558/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521606007&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=Diagnostic+and+Statistical+Manual+of+Mental+Disorders" target="_blank"><i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i></a> notes, “The obsessions or compulsions are time-consuming…or cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.”</p>
<p>In addition, Hyman and Pedrick write that although everyone worries from time to time, even sometimes excessively, “the worries resulting from OCD differ in that they are usually senseless and irrational, and ignoring them makes the person feel anxious and nervous.” And though people without OCD can also be compulsive, “the compulsions of people with OCD are senseless and repetitive and are performed to dispel anxiety.”</p>
<p>Kissin relates that the difference between OCD and everyday worries gets asked often, and can’t be self-diagnosed because the obsessive thoughts related to OCD are not outrageous. It’s not the fear of something like “aliens coming down,” but rather anxiety about events that could actually happen, such as getting sick or something bad happening to loved ones.</p>
<h2>What To Do If You Suspect OCD</h2>
<p>If you’re concerned that your worries or actions might be caused by OCD, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/05/what-is-therapy-the-complete-definition-of-psychotherapy/" target="_blank">the best course of action is to seek out a professional opinion</a>, whether it’s a trained therapist or even, as Kissen suggests, “starting with your primary care provider.” They will be able to supply an official assessment, diagnosis, and treatment plan, which may include therapy, medication, or both.</p>
<p>One of the most effective treatments for OCD is exposure and response prevention therapy (ERP). ERP exposes you to the thoughts, images, or situations that cause fear while not taking compulsive action to relieve the anxiety. Using our stove example, in ERP you might be asked to only check the stove one time. While this will cause high levels of fear at first, over time when the house does not burn down after checking the stove once instead of 12 times, the anxiety lessens. With repeated exposures, eventually the symptoms of OCD will no longer control a person’s life.</p>
<p>Even if you have suspicions that you or a loved one’s worries may be a little more than just common anxiety, reach out for help and know you’re certainly not alone. If it turns out you have OCD, with the right support and a little hard work, it doesn’t have to rule your life.</p>
<p>In fact, “OCD is one of the most treatable mental illnesses,” Kissen tells Talkspace, “so there’s hope.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I see that stage of my life as dark pages to be flipped quickly. I still consider it the toughest struggle I’ve ever been through and hope my challenges don’t get harder than being a young patient dealing with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder [OCD].</p>
<p>The symptoms first showed up during 10th grade. I had unusual thoughts instructing me to undertake certain actions. They were actually more like commands.</p>
<p>It seemed normal in the beginning, but these thoughts gradually increased. They became intense and repetitive, so repetitive it was distracting. I felt I had to obey the thoughts to stop them from recurring. As I yielded to a thought, obeying its command, it did shut up for a while, but only until another new one showed up in the same compulsive way. The thoughts followed one another in an endless loop. I couldn’t escape no matter how hard I tried.</p>
<p>The disorder got so severe that I sometimes wished for death, believing it was the only way to end the battle taking place in my mind. I lived in a state of perpetual mental exhaustion.<span id="more-6668"></span></p>
<p>I couldn’t easily decide what to do because it was hard to figure out what precisely was going on. Were these thoughts coming from me or the OCD itself? Sometimes it felt like the OCD was invading my mind. Other times it seemed like an extension of myself. It was difficult to separate the two.</p>
<p>Eventually the cognitive storm started to negatively influence my mood. I still recall how tough it was, not knowing how to stop the intrusive stream of commands, having no one to talk to, feeling both weak and afraid. I remember how I used to break down when I was alone. I sobbed and cried until I was relieved. The feeling of completely falling apart hurt like hell.</p>
<p>I tried hiding whatever happened in my head from other people, pretending everything was normal. Thankfully, my academics weren’t affected much; I could still get straight As. Nonetheless, trying to balance between all the mess in my brain and external expectations — social and school life — was difficult.</p>
<p>Day after day, my mental state got worse. I couldn’t handle it on my own. I desperately needed help, which made me think of telling mom about what I was experiencing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I didn’t receive the help I wanted and desperately needed.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to describe how terrible it feels when the people closest to you, the ones who love you the most, consider you partially insane. Although they didn’t say it out loud, they didn’t treat me as before. Deep inside I knew they wanted my state to improve, but the only advice I received was to stop listening to those commands.</p>
<p>“Ignore them!” the chorus of friends and relatives seemed to shout in unison.</p>
<p>After about six months of suffering, I started researching my symptoms and learned it was Obsessive Compulsive Disorder [OCD], a known disorder that occurs across the world and in all varieties of populations. OCD doesn’t discriminate — anyone can suffer from it. As I searched more and more, the situation became clear. Low concentrations of neurotransmitters — serotonin specifically — along with abnormal hyperactivity in certain areas of my brain, had turned my mind into a container of chaos.</p>
<p>I needed to work with a professional, but convincing my parents was challenging. They believed it was my fault for obeying the obsessive thoughts. I had to live with OCD for another couple of months, during which time my symptoms became so extreme I could barely function.</p>
<p>As a last resort, I called my older sister, who knew about OCD and my ordeals. She was understanding and supportive, so I asked her to talk to my parents about seeking treatment. Thankfully, with my sister’s prompting, they agreed.</p>
<p>Afterwards my mom booked me an appointment in a psychiatric clinic. The staff considered my illness “moderate OCD.” I can’t even imagine how torturing and intense amore severe OCD would be. A psychiatrist prescribed 20 mg a day of Prozac and psychotherapy sessions.</p>
<p>Later on I was introduced to my therapist, who was helpful and sweet. As I went on with the medication and therapy, I began to feel calmer.</p>
<p>Having to visit the psychiatric clinic regularly changed my image of mental health and sufferers of mental illness. The people I met in the hallways and waiting room were normal people. If you saw them on the street, you wouldn’t know they were suffering from a severe mental health condition.</p>
<p>I realized then how unfair our society is toward those with mental illnesses.
