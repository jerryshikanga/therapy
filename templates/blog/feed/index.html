				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It would be nice if every relationship had a straight 50/50 power dynamic split&#8230;but those in relationships will tell you that’s probably not the case in their partnership. Relationships <i>should</i> be about a shared, equal bond, where partners are teammates who make compromises and share power, rather than a coach versus team member dynamic. Right?</p>
<p><span id="more-11461"></span></p>
<p>Think about this common question couples get asked: “So, who wears the pants in this relationship?” Usually, pop culture tells us the man in a heterosexual couple should “wear the pants.” If the woman “wears the pants” the man is looked at as “whipped” and sometimes even teased for it. By talking about and asking who’s <i>wearing the pants</i>, we’re perpetuating the idea that one person should be in charge.</p>
<p>It’s like society <i>demands </i>one person hold more power in the relationship. What happened to equality?</p>
<h2>Why Dominant Roles Exist in Relationships</h2>
<p>There are multiple reasons why one person may exert more power in a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relationship</a>.</p>
<p>“[Roles in relationships] depend on experiences in our lives,” Kimberly Leitch, LCSW-R and Talkspace therapist, says, “Someone may have been in a controlling relationship previously and now they tend to be in control of their present relationship in fear of repeating the same mistakes. The importance of balance varies with each person.”</p>
<p>Of course, there are other life events that can cause someone to be the controlling partner in a relationship — even events from <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/11/can-childhood-traumas-cause-panic-disorder/">childhood</a>. For example, if somebody had very controlling parents, it’s common that they too might desire control, even in a romantic relationship. Or, if someone experienced lots of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/11/why-rejection-hurts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejection</a> as they were growing up, they might take extreme measures in relationships to make sure they aren’t rejected or abandoned again.</p>
<h2>When it’s Okay to Defer to Your Partner</h2>
<p>In certain cases, taking ownership of the power dynamic is okay, if it’s in a healthy way, and makes sense for each partner.</p>
<p>“There are some personality types that like to relinquish the control onto their partner because they cannot handle the stress of the responsibilities or being in control elicits <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a>.” Leitch says. “I have a client whose husband works and therefore she is in charge of everything else [at home] and it works in their relationship. He also tends to be a passive person whereas she is a big personality and tends to be more assertive. He follows her lead and he doesn’t have to be bothered making decisions.”</p>
<p>In this case, the skewed power dynamic makes sense, so long as the passive partner continues to feel okay with the arrangement, and speaks up if they want more say in decisions around the house.</p>
<p>Even in situations like the one Leitch described, an imbalance of power can definitely turn unhealthy.</p>
<p>“It becomes an issue when you feel like you are not being heard and there is no sense of <i>you</i> in the relationship. It can lead you to feel uncomfortable and insecure.” Leitch explains, “You may feel like you are submitting to your partner’s likes or interests, which is not being reciprocated. It is important to communicate these feelings with your partner to avoid any negative feelings or behaviors.”</p>
<p>If you land in a place like this, where you feel like you don’t have a voice in your relationship, it’s definitely time to reevaluate your partnership and roles. Allowing an unhealthy power dynamic to persist can take a toll on even the strongest relationship.</p>
<h2>What to Do When You’ve Lost Control in a Relationship</h2>
<p>Here are some things you can do if you feel like your partner is being too controlling, or the power dynamic has shifted in an unfavorable way.</p>
<h3>Be introspective</h3>
<p>Look inside yourself and ask <i>why </i>you’re putting up with being bossed around. Do you feel worthy of healthy love? Are you scared of losing your partner? Are you feeling stuck because you’re scared your partner might physically hurt you if you try to leave? Are <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/how-to-recognize-emotional-abuse-in-intimate-relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controlling relationships</a> all you know?</p>
<p>Journal about your feelings, speak to a loved one, or bring it up in therapy.</p>
<h3>Communicate with your partner</h3>
<p>It’s possible your partner might not even realize how controlling they’re being. Speak up about your feelings, and explain the situation from your point of view in a non-confrontational manner. Spell out scenarios where your partner made you feel poorly about yourself or controlled.</p>
<p>Try to stay calm and level headed. As with any conflict in a relationship, communication is key. While it can be awkward to start a difficult conversation with a partner, learning to do so is crucial.</p>
<h3>Be confident and stand strong</h3>
<p>All too often, people lose themselves when they are in a controlling relationship. Stand your ground and try to take back some of your power in subtle ways by remaining <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/5-ways-improve-body-image-confidence-mental-health/">confident</a> and aware. It may also help to be more independent than usual, which helps you prove to yourself that you can be independent and take care of yourself. Keep your guard up so you can’t be so easily manipulated.</p>
<h3>Give couples therapy a try</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/couples-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Couples therapy</a> is great for couples who are struggling with any problem. A couple’s therapist can provide a safe space for each person to voice their concerns, and the therapist can help facilitate the conversation as well as help the couple understand each other. It can also help ease your nerves if you’re scared of confronting your partner one on one.</p>
<h3>Recognize signs of abuse</h3>
<p>Sadly, domestic abuse is common. Controlling behavior can sometimes be a sign or predictor of abusive behavior. Educate yourself on <a href="https://www.thehotline.org/is-this-abuse/abuse-defined/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the signs of domestic abuse</a> so you can be aware of what’s going on in your relationship and if things are on the road to getting dangerous.</p>
<p>If you believe you are being abused, tell a loved one and get in touch with an organization like <a href="https://www.thehotline.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The National Domestic Abuse Hotline</a> for help. This step also goes along with knowing when it’s time to walk away from the relationship and leave before it gets any worse.</p>
<h2>No Relationship is Perfect, but it Should Be Healthy</h2>
<p>While no relationship is perfect, and you shouldn’t necessarily strive for “perfect,” everybody deserves a safe, healthy relationship. A super controlling partner definitely does not equate to a healthy and happy relationship.</p>
<p>It’s okay to share duties and give up control of some areas or aspects of a relationship, but always be aware of your feelings, recognize controlling partners, and look out for the signs of abuse. Nobody deserves to feel powerless or unsafe in a relationship.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The night of my first <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/02/dating-someone-with-anxiety-what-you-need-to-know-and-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">date</a> with my ex, I felt strong, instant chemistry. The butterflies in my stomach felt more like large birds, and each kiss felt like 4th of July fireworks. Actually, even just looking at him made me feel fireworks!</p>
<p>We became official, and from there…it went downhill. Why? We were lacking consistency and things that came along with it, like trust. Once I wasn’t so blinded by chemistry, I realized we weren’t <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/is-your-relationship-over-5-questions-to-ask-before-calling-it-quits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compatible</a> and there were aspects of the relationship that were not healthy. When it came down to it, we wanted different things in life. There were parts of him I could not accept and parts of me that he could not accept.<span id="more-11447"></span></p>
<p>I learned it the hard way: Sparks are fun, but they’re not what makes a relationship last.</p>
<h2>The Difference Between Relationship Chemistry and Consistency</h2>
<p>This isn’t to say chemistry isn’t important in relationships — of course it is, particularly at the beginning! However, people who have experienced amazing, unbelievable chemistry (like me) can be the first to tell you that chemistry <i>does not</i> equal consistency, and it definitely doesn’t equal a long lasting and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/guide-setting-healthy-boundaries-relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy relationship</a>.</p>
<p>As with many things, the key is <i>balance. </i>Chemistry comes naturally and easily, and that’s part of what’s so great about it. Consistency, on the other hand, takes work and dedication to a partner.</p>
<h3>Relationship chemistry explained</h3>
<p>To better understand and break down chemistry versus consistency, I spoke to Cynthia Catchings, LCSW-S and Talkspace therapist.</p>
<p>“Chemistry is the initial feeling we have when we are attracted to someone. It has also been described as the biological effects of lust and attraction,” Catchings explains. “Experiencing these feelings can mean we feel we are on cloud nine and somewhat blind to reality. Although chemistry is a fantastic feeling, it is not the most important predictor of a good relationship. Basically, it is just a feeling that masks our significant other’s worst traits and lures us into putting up with them. Now, is chemistry fun and worth the ride? Absolutely, but only if we are aware that it is just part of a phase.”</p>
<p>You might be aware of this phase, often referred to as the <b><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/12/commitment-issues-reasons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">honeymoon phase</a></b>. During this time, fights are often minimal (or perhaps even non-existent) and it seems like our partner can do no wrong. Chemistry is peaking, butterflies are flying, and a lot of sex is probably being had.</p>
<p>Once the honeymoon phase is over, consistency is key. Any couple can probably make it through their honeymoon phase — it’s what comes next that’s harder and determines whether a relationship will last.</p>
<h3>The importance of consistency in a relationship</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/02/everything-you-need-to-know-about-couples-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Couples</a> will inevitably face hardship, have to make tough decisions, and run into <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/is-it-a-normal-fight-or-verbal-abuse-heres-how-to-tell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conflict</a>. And what’s going to get a couple through that? Consistency.</p>
<p>“Chemistry is necessary and good because it creates the desire and is part of the relationship game,” Catchings says, “However, consistency has to take over for that relationship to succeed.”</p>
<p>Feeling pure lust is a great feeling, and the honeymoon phase is super-fun, but we also must acknowledge the fact that chemistry alone isn’t going to establish an extra-solid foundation for a relationship. Certain relationship aspects, such as trust, don’t really bloom out of chemistry. They’re aspects that must be worked on consistently throughout the relationship.</p>
<p>“Consistency is a combination of behaviors that include dependability, trust, and a true desire to have a companion and form a serious relationship.” Catchings adds, “People who are more consistent with their interactions with one another, such as having predictable behaviors and good <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/07/dear-therapist-im-hearing-you-say-my-communication-skills-need-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">communication</a>, have longer and more successful relationships.”</p>
<h2>How to Start and Maintain a Successful Relationship</h2>
<p>Successful relationships will last once chemistry is no longer at its highest, and once partners have learned enough about each other and their flaws. In the long run, chemistry isn’t always as important as you might think it is.</p>
<p>“Think of a relationship as a cake,” Catchings suggests. “The chemistry is the frosting and the consistency is the bread. The frosting can be too sweet or melt, so it’s okay if it is not there. It just gives the cake a nice look and some sweetness.”</p>
<p>If you’re just starting out in a new relationship, encourage yourself to dig deeper than the chemistry and initial attraction. Learn about your partner, and allow your partner “inside” your world and your past so that they can learn about you, too.</p>
<p>It’s also great to be upfront about your desires and needs throughout the relationship. If you’ve already been together for a while and you’re missing the feeling of exciting chemistry, you can attempt to bring some <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/7-relationship-myths-debunked-by-a-therapist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">romance</a> and excitement back into your partnership by trying new activities together, experimenting with new things in bed, or going on a romantic getaway!</p>
<p>As Catchings puts it, “consistency is a more pure form of love that lets us know that we are in the right relationship.”</p>
<h2>Every Relationship is Different</h2>
<p>In the end, every relationship is different, and every couple will encounter their own set of problems. Each relationship will balance chemistry and consistency in different ways.</p>
<p>It may take a lot of work to find the right balance, or even to find the right partner to get the balance right, but when it comes to relationships, everything is a great learning experience.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you’ll end up with a delicious cake — topped just the right amount of perfectly sweet frosting.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some people keep feelings and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/control-emotions-cognitive-behavioral-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emotions</a> close to the vest. They aren&#8217;t bad people, but it can be frustrating when we’re only treated to occasional glimmers of their sparkling personality. Their slow message response times (leaving you “on read”) and unaccepted invitations make you feel unwanted, or that you&#8217;re the only person putting in any effort.</p>
<p>Having a heart-to-heart with a cheerful, friendly person, however, rarely feels like a struggle. But if everyone was cheerful and friendly, we&#8217;d already have world peace. Dealing with people who are distant seems to present a bigger challenge.<span id="more-11443"></span></p>
<p>Chances are they&#8217;re not <i>trying</i> to make you feel bad. And luckily, continuing the effort can reward you with a wonderful new friend, or a closer relationship with a familiar face.</p>
<p>Whether this distant person is part of a burgeoning relationship, a family member you&#8217;ve always admired, or a newly reclusive sibling or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/12/dating-someone-with-social-anxiety-6-tips-from-a-therapist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spouse</a>, here is how to show them you value their presence.</p>
<h2>Have Empathy</h2>
<p>A number of traits and mental illnesses lead to a distant personality. Insecure attachment styles, like reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social engagement disorder, can make people hesitant to start up conversations, seek comfort in the company of others, or ask for what they want directly.</p>
<p>However, just because someone is distant doesn&#8217;t mean they qualify for these disorders. In fact, the DSM says these behaviors must be present before <a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/915447-overview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">age five</a> to count as a &#8220;disorder.&#8221; <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anxiety</a> and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depression</a> can also easily manifest as distance. Pushing away loved ones is a common symptom of depression.</p>
<p>Even lesser stressors, like buying a home, going through finals, or helping a sick relative can lead a person to someone retreating and acting distant.</p>
<p>You may not know specifically what causes a person to distance themselves. They may not <i>want</i> you to know, and that&#8217;s okay. Don&#8217;t push for an explanation. But have empathy when reaching out: Refusing to easily share feelings doesn&#8217;t mean they’re rude or dislike you.</p>
<h2>Open Yourself Up</h2>
<p>Some distant people struggle to share their feelings. They may be embarrassed by their emotions, or scared of being vulnerable.</p>
<p>When dealing with a distant person, consider taking a few leaps of vulnerability yourself. Don&#8217;t reveal your whole life story — that can scare off even the friendliest stranger! — but show them that you&#8217;re not scared of serious conversation. By taking that first frightening step, you provide an opening for them, too.</p>
<h2>Give Them Time</h2>
<p>Demonstrating vulnerability is a fantastic way to engage a distant person. Just keep in mind: distance is not changed in one conversation. It may take time for your friend to fully open up.</p>
<p>For example, if a person is distant because <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/01/what-causes-social-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">socializing</a> increases their anxiety, they may only have the energy for one conversation per week. Consider their emotional resources like a battery: every interaction decreases the charge. Refueling time is mandatory, so texts may be slow or they may decline your next invitation out.</p>
<p>Relationship progress can be exciting, but don&#8217;t be disheartened when a distant person moves more slowly than you.</p>
<h2>Be Frank</h2>
<p>When you talk to your friend, make sure to used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-message" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><i>I-focused</i> language</a>: &#8220;I feel like you don&#8217;t respect me when you ignore my text messages&#8221; instead of &#8220;You are being disrespectful when you ignore my texts.&#8221; Accusations may make them <i>more</i> distant.</p>
<p>Quick caveat: be <i>frank</i>, not cruel. Since distance may be driven by depression and anxiety, avoiding harsh criticism is best. But many people don&#8217;t recognize their own distancing <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/identifying-avoidant-partner-improve-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">behavior</a>, and a heads-up might do them a favor.</p>
<h2>Pay attention to what works</h2>
<p>Whenever you interact, keep close tabs on what works — and what makes them shy away. Did sharing your own struggles encourage them, or did you find them more distant after that chat? Did they make an effort to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/10/why-some-people-isolate-and-some-reach-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reach out</a> more often after you told them how their distance makes you feel? You don&#8217;t want to smother someone who prefers less interaction.</p>
<h2>Respect Your Differences</h2>
<p>Remember, every person is different. Depending on the reasons for their distance, they may respond better to different approaches. Get to know them and you&#8217;ll be better able to predict what makes them tick.</p>
<p>Making friends is important — as is getting to know old friends and family better. But if the distance grates on your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/why-successful-people-struggle-with-mental-illness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health</a>, take a time-out break for your <i>own</i> sake. And if their unresponsiveness leaves you sad, talking with your therapist can help you set expectations or barriers.</p>

These lucky people often couple up and ride off into a beautiful sunset&#8230;until, of course, life stressors get in the way and interrupt the honeymoon phase.</p>
<p>Other people, however, see commitment in less idealized terms. It is common to say that there is something wrong with people who have “commitment issues,” but that’s reductive and a little simplistic in most cases. In actuality, there are many factors contributing to what we call commitment issues, and they run the gamut from psychological to evolutionary.<span id="more-11439"></span></p>
<h2>1. Attachment Issues</h2>
<p>People with avoidant attachment find it difficult to connect to others in an interdependent way. Avoidant attachment comes from learning in <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/09/childhood-attachment-styles-influence-adult-relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">childhood</a> that a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/dont-get-along-with-your-parents-a-therapists-tips-for-how-to-manage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parent</a> cannot be counted upon to provide reliably for your emotional needs.</p>
<p>In adulthood, these individuals focus mainly on being self-reliant, and merging their life with that of a partner feels scary and uncomfortable. Even when they are in love, they often are hesitant to jump into commitment with both feet.</p>
<h2>2. You’re Not With the Right Partner</h2>
<p>Sometimes, people stay in a stable <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/09/relationship-sabotage-when-going-well/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relationship</a> even when they know on a deep level that their partner isn’t a good fit, or they’re not in love with that person.</p>
<p>The desire for safety and security outweighs their suspicion that they will never feel entirely fulfilled with their partner. Fear of change prevents them from moving on, but their partner often perceives their ambivalence as fear of commitment.</p>
<h2>3. Your Partner Refuses to Work on Key Issues That Bother You</h2>
<p>Long term, you may fear that certain issues will preclude a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/what-is-happiness-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happy</a> marriage with your partner.</p>
<p>For example, if your partner has untreated depression, you may fear that you will be attaching yourself to someone who cannot truly enjoy life with you. If your partner refuses to get treatment, you may well feel ambivalence about commitment to them.</p>
<h2>4. You Tend to Self-Sabotage</h2>
<p>There are many people who subconsciously tend to sabotage anything good that may come their way. Often, this is due to a childhood where good things never happened, or where good things ended too quickly.</p>
<p>For example, growing up with a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depressed</a> or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/04/alcohol-abuse-signs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alcoholic</a> parent, you often learn that most interactions are unpredictable and don’t end well. In adulthood, you may shy away from a relationship that feels too good, because you fear the other shoe may drop.</p>
<h2>5. Monogamy is Difficult</h2>
<p>Evolutionarily speaking, people were never supposed to mate forever, especially now that our lifespans have dramatically increased.</p>
<p>People in long term relationships may feel a lessening of their sexual desire for their partner over time. Many people who are scared of commitment are also scared of the idea of their, and their partner’s, desire waning significantly over time.</p>
<h2>Does This Sound Familiar?</h2>
<p>If any, or many, of these issues resonate with you, you may find it beneficial to speak with a therapist. It is essential to figure out which part of your “commitment issues” are due to you, and which parts are due to other factors, like the relationship as a whole or overall differences in personality.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/02/everything-you-need-to-know-about-couples-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couples counseling</a> can be useful for those who believe they would commit if key issues were worked through and resolved. Individually or as a couple, discussing your feelings, your relationship history, and your family background can often illuminate what relationship direction you should choose.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the internet, there are endless lists of the things you can do to heal yourself of any ailment: from <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depression</a> to migraines, from <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a> to irritable bowel syndrome. Apparently you can cure anything simply chant positive mantras, drink enough water to become a camel, and practice yoga 24/7&#8230;maybe even shower while standing on one&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>The internet would like us to believe that this is particularly true when it comes to mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression. If I had a dime for every time I’ve heard &#8220;just do X to snap out of Y,&#8221; I&#8217;d be retired, sipping umbrella drinks in Tahiti.<span id="more-11434"></span></p>
<p>That said, there has been more than anecdotal evidence that something as simple as regular <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/5-ways-exercise-is-great-for-your-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exercise</a> cure anxiety and depression. Some experts maintain that exercise holds the potential to ease the symptoms of many illnesses, including those of the mental variety. Let’s explore whether exercise really can make a difference with anxiety and depression, or similar mental illness diagnoses that affect <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">one in five Americans</a>.</p>
<h2>Endorphins Are Our Friends</h2>
<p>Everyone knows about the endorphin rush you feel after a good workout. Doesn&#8217;t that rush wear off, though?</p>
<p><a href="https://media.utoronto.ca/media-releases/moderate-exercise-not-only-treats-but-prevents-depression/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">According to a University of Toronto study</a>, individuals who are active for 20-30 minutes each day can ward off depression in the long-term. Choose a workout that you love, such as dance, running or weightlifting, and make it a regular part of your routine to not only treat, but according to the study, prevent depression.</p>
<h2>Rerouting Nervous Energy</h2>
<p>While exercise is by no means a substitute for <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/am-i-going-to-be-on-meds-forever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">medication</a> and psychiatric care, it can diffuse excess anxious energy. Working out regulates adrenaline, the chemical that gives us our fight-or-flight response to danger. It’s been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3632802/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">shown by many studies and meta-analyses</a> that exercise is associated with reduced anxiety in clinical settings.</p>
<p>For this reason, exercise can sometimes assist those with anxiety disorders to minimize their <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/anxiety-attack-vs-panic-attack-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panic</a>. The next time you’re feeling anxious try taking a brisk walk if possible.</p>
<h2>The Michael Phelps&#8217; Experience</h2>
<p>Olympic gold medal winner Michael Phelps <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/michael" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">discusses the connections between exercise and depression</a> when he opened up about his own mental health struggles. Obviously, just knowing that one of the most elite athletes in the world actively works through mental health challenges should show that working out is not a cure-all for mental illness.</p>
<p>However, by utilizing exercise in combination with medication and/or talk therapy with a licensed mental health professional, you can make great strides toward better mental health outcomes.</p>
<h2>Be Honest about Expectations</h2>
<p>When he couldn&#8217;t complete a workout for any reason (e.g., busy schedule, time in transit), Michael Phelps noticed the negative impact on his mental health. It became as simple as making the time, no matter where he was, rather than being harsh with himself or making up excuses not to.</p>
<p>Depression often causes overwhelming feelings of lethargy that simply can&#8217;t be pushed through. So be gentle with yourself during these times! What you don&#8217;t want to do is feel guilty <a href="https://www.self.com/story/depression-anxiety-exercise“ target=”_blank" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">over missing a workout</a> when you&#8217;re already feeling low.</p>
<p>Keep your exercise expectations reasonable. You wouldn&#8217;t give yourself a guilt trip for missing a workout when you had the flu, so if your symptoms are just too much, be kind as you excuse yourself. Remember though, that exercise often lifts us out of these tough places.</p>
<h2>Remember, Palliative Care Is Still Care</h2>
<p>If you suffer from <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/what-is-crippling-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chronic depression</a> or anxiety, you no doubt know you may be in for a lifelong battle. However, it’s important not to let your challenges throw you into a deeper despair.</p>
<p>Even if combining exercise with your regular treatment doesn&#8217;t bring a cure, it can lift your spirits for a time and provide some extra motivation. Even if exercise is not be a cure, if it can make you feel better, it&#8217;s worth doing. It is also important for your overall health, which should be plenty motivating.</p>
<p>Living with anxiety or depression, or both, isn&#8217;t easy. If you suffer from mental illness, you already know how hard it can be. While it&#8217;s not a cure, exercise can be another weapon in the battle against depression and anxiety.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you&#8217;re looking down the barrel of a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/08/college-students-guide-mental-health-wish-knew/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">school</a> midterm report or a major work project, finding inspiration should be easy. You&#8217;re on deadline, after all! But the urge to procrastinate strikes us all, and often at the worst times.</p>
<p>Procrastination takes many forms, and leans on avoidant traits that end up harming us in the long run.. Here are the main reasons we procrastinate — and how to stop.<span id="more-11431"></span></p>
<h2>1. The pursuit of perfection</h2>
<p>A project left undone still has potential for perfection. An unwritten report has no typos. An uncoded program, no bugs. In a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/the-imperfection-of-perfectionism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perfectionist</a> mindset, when you do work, you risk screwing something up. And that&#8217;s a scary thought to some. By procrastinating, we hold ourselves to an impossible standard — and as a result, never achieve anything noteworthy.</p>
<p>Science backs this theory up: A <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/khoffman/Psyc3010/Flett'92_PerfProcr.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">study from York University</a> indicated that students who scored highly in measures of perfectionism also had strong tendencies to procrastinate.</p>
<p>But how do you squash your perfectionist tendencies and get back to the grind? A therapist can help you work through the root causes of your perfectionism, like anxiety. Also, there are some exercises <a href="&quot;https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/4-signs-perfectionism-is-holding-you-back-and-how-to-break-free/“" target="”_blank”">you can do yourself</a>, like changing how you consider &#8220;success&#8221; and being kinder to yourself.</p>
<p>Once you learn to face the possibility of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/psychology-behind-success-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failure</a>, starting projects becomes much simpler.</p>
<h2>2. Low energy levels</h2>
<p>Sometimes we procrastinate because we can&#8217;t do anything else: The thought of opening our laptop, sitting down at our desk, and writing 10 pages (10 pages!?) seems impossible. There can be a number of causes for <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2015/06/6-helpful-tips-on-how-to-unleash-your-motivation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low energy</a>.</p>
<p>First, do a healthy-habits check. Are you eating junk food? Drinking too much? <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/07/sleeping-with-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sleeping</a> less than eight hours a day? Not exercising? Any one of these problems could be your procrastination culprit. But if you&#8217;re generally doing right by your body, it&#8217;s time to call in a pro.</p>
<p>A doctor can check your blood: you may have anemia, a hypoactive thyroid, or low B-12. They can also go over your medical history for any other diagnoses that may lead to low energy.</p>
<p>Depression can also cause low energy. A therapist can help make that assessment and get you the help you need.</p>
<h2>3. Inability to focus</h2>
<p>You want to work on your paper. You really do. But every time you open your computer, you find yourself browsing to Facebook or Reddit — and suddenly eight hours of mindless “sugar-filled” entertainment have passed, and you&#8217;ve written <i>maybe</i> ten words.</p>
<p>Improving your focus isn&#8217;t impossible. A number of techniques help you hone in on the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3050123/8-ways-to-improve-your-focus" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">task at hand</a>, like brief meditation beforehand, unplugging from technology, or listening to calming background music. But if <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/03/finding-inner-peace-mindfulness-5-senses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mindfulness</a> isn&#8217;t helping, consider checking in with your therapist. You might have ADHD.</p>
<p>While procrastination isn&#8217;t <a href="http://www.epanlab.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Niermann-Scheres-2014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">a direct symptom of ADHD</a>, research has shown that there are correlations between procrastinators and other symptoms. A mental health professional can determine if you have related behaviors that indicate an ADHD diagnosis — and are causing your procrastination, too.</p>
<h2>4. Believing a better you will do it later</h2>
<p>“Future you” will <i>totally</i> get this done. Future you will have endless opportunities to succeed. For instance, it&#8217;s supposed to rain on Saturday, so hiking won&#8217;t tempt you. And by the weekend, you&#8217;ll know for sure if you got the promotion you were angling for, so you&#8217;ll be in a much better <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/control-emotions-cognitive-behavioral-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mood</a>.</p>
<p>But we can&#8217;t hoist our problems onto our future selves. If we&#8217;re waiting for the perfect time and the ideal circumstances, we may not get <i>anything</i> done. Maybe the sun shines on Saturday — and maybe you get passed over for the job. Future you could be just as gloomy and sad as you are today, so why not just get started?</p>
<p>If the project looks too momentous for current you, break it into smaller pieces. Work for just ten minutes and then “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsABTmT1_M0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">treat yo self</a>” with something small. Repeat this process enough times and the project will be done — before future you has a chance to muck it up.</p>
<h2>5. The task is vague or uncertain</h2>
<p>Sometimes, we avoid doing a project because we don&#8217;t know what the project really entails. Perhaps the instructions are vague, or the scope is enormous — leaving you flailing about.</p>
<p>To sort out the task and fix this pesky problem, get out your pen and paper (or whatever brainstorming tool works best for you). Write down everything that needs to get done, starting with the tiniest aspects. For a long research paper, &#8220;go to the library&#8221; or &#8220;do a Google search&#8221; are acceptable step ones.</p>
<p>Find an easy, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/how-setting-micro-goals-can-increase-happiness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manageable</a> first task and go from there. Once you&#8217;ve completed that to-do, go back to your list. Have any new must-dos come up? Add them. Go down the list step by step until you&#8217;ve got the whole thing done. And if the procrastination monster rises again, feel free to go scorched-earth and repeat this process entirely. Getting lost in the woods of our to-do list is also an easy invitation for procrastination.</p>
<h2>Seek Help if Procrastination is Affecting You</h2>
<p>Procrastination is a frustrating desire. Of course we want to get the project done — it&#8217;s hanging over our head like <a href="https://www.history.com/news/what-was-the-sword-of-damocles" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Damocles&#8217; sword</a>. But sometimes we just <i>can&#8217;t do it</i>. Identifying the root cause of your hesitation is the key to get must-do work done.</p>
<p>A therapist or counselor can teach you methods to help work past whatever is holding you back from completing important tasks or projects. They also provide a safe level of accountability that can be followed up on weekly. Consider this type of help if procrastination is affecting your performance or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/what-is-happiness-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happiness</a> in critical areas like work or relationships.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At a young age, many of us are taught that telling a lie is <i>absolutely</i> bad. Yet as we grow up, we slowly become exposed to small, “white” lies — those told to keep us from becoming upset or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/05/sadness-or-depression-how-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sad</a>. Even as we transition into adulthood, well-meaning lies are often told to shield a person from criticism or added hardship. But can we ever be sure telling a lie is the right thing to do?<span id="more-11427"></span></p>
<h2>Why We Tell White Lies</h2>
<p>As a parent, using white lies to help prevent a child from feeling upset is a common practice, and according to <a href="&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28493758“" target="”_blank”">research</a>, is socially acceptable across many cultures. A parent, for instance, may tell small lies to keep a child from worrying about a missing stuffed animal, or calm their fear of getting a shot at the doctor’s office. Often, this act is perceived as being compassionate and is considered a “<a href="&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597814000983“" target="”_blank”">prosocial lie</a>,” which entails a person lying to prevent harm to another individual.</p>
<p>Even into adulthood, those “smaller” lies often continue. Many adults may feel they are put in situations where lying is the only ethical option. If a person asks you how they look on their wedding day, for instance, there is only one acceptable answer, despite what your honest opinion may be. In a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/09/assert-yourself-at-work/">work</a> setting, the same may be true when it comes to interactions with your boss or in situations where you feel the need to prevent someone’s embarrassment or discomfort when receiving criticism.</p>
<p>The question then becomes whether this type of lie is less harmful than just being honest from the start.</p>
<h2>Is Lying Ever Undeniably Bad?</h2>
<p>If every lie told could prevent harm to another person, without any ill-effects, it would make the answer to this question more clear. But in reality, falsely telling someone they did a fantastic job when they did not, or letting someone believe they are a contender for a promotion, when they are not, can result in more harm than good.</p>
<p>This type of lie — a <a href="&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074959781630509X?via%3Dihub“" target="”_blank”">paternalistic</a> lie — requires the deceiver to make assumptions about whether the lie is in the best interest of the person receiving it. This results in strong resentment from deceived parties, and in many cases, backfires.</p>
<p>To help encourage more honesty in your professional and personal life and avoid the need to lie, make sure you are creating settings where you feel comfortable telling the truth (and are helping others feel they can do so as well). By being honest as much as possible you can create conditions where those around you feel heard and believed. This will help to stop deception with positive intent.</p>
<h2>How to Decide When to Lie</h2>
<p>While some may choose to stick with honesty as the best and only policy, if you do choose to tell a lie or skew the truth in some way, consider the following two factors: The size and intention of the lie — are your reason prosocial, paternalistic, or are they purely deceptive and malicious — and the potential repercussions if you are caught. While it may be the <i>best </i>policy, as we’ve seen, the truth is not the only policy. Some lies are necessary and even justified.</p>
<p>Even if the lie seems harmless at the surface, it’s important to weigh these considerations before deciding if it is better left unsaid. And remember, if you’re honest, it’s easier to keep your story straight and won’t have any negative impact on your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/why-successful-people-struggle-with-mental-illness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health</a> (like feeling guilty about your deceit).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When someone has wronged you in some way, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/07/why-feeling-anger-is-good-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anger</a> is a natural reaction. If what happened is especially painful — or if the person who hurt you is unwilling to take responsibility — you may start to form a grudge against that person.</p>
<p>Many of us hold grudges for a limited time, and are able to let them go after some healthy processing. Others hold onto them for years, and may even have grudges stemming from their childhood. Most of us will only hold grudges against a few select people; others seem to collect grudges readily and with vigor.<span id="more-11418"></span></p>
<p>However they play out for you — and even if you don’t think of yourself as a “grudge-holding person” — almost all of us have held a grudge at some point or another. Holding grudges is a very common human behavior, but it can be unhealthy in the long-term. Here’s why.</p>
<h2>The Problem With Holding Grudges</h2>
<p>Having a grudge here or there isn’t necessarily abnormal or even problematic. The problem is that, sometimes, grudges can take on a life of their own.</p>
<p>Grudge holding can be a cyclical pattern — and once we get sucked in, it can be hard to find out way out.</p>
<p>“People often get stuck in the cycle of holding grudges because they expect something from someone and that expectation hasn’t been fulfilled,” says Rachel O’Neill, Ph.D., a licensed professional clinical <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/mental-health-counselor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">counselor</a> in Ohio and a Talkspace provider.</p>
<p>For example, you might feel that someone has wronged you in some way. Let’s say the person has attempted an apology or taken responsibility in some way, but you don’t find this acceptable or sufficient. When something like this happens, says O’Neill, “grudges can deepen and individuals can feel more entrenched in feelings of resentment or bitterness toward the person.”</p>
<p>Of course, the more angry and bitter you are toward someone, the harder it becomes to work through any issues you have with them. Grudges can easily spiral into a never-ending cycle of blame and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/anger-emotions-run-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rage</a>, which is why it’s important to work toward resolution internally, or with the other party..</p>
<h2>Are There Any Benefits To Holding Grudges?</h2>
<p>Clearly, holding grudges isn’t beneficial for anyone in the long run. But are there situations where holding a grudge is justified?</p>
<p>There’s no denying there are people in our lives who act in toxic ways. Often there is no good way to remedy these situations without <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/11/fighting-style-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conflict</a>; and some of the people who have hurt us seem incapable of authentic apologies.</p>
<p>So perhaps there are ways that grudges can act as a healthy coping mechanism. Maybe holding a grudge against someone who has behaved in a harmful way could serve as a wake-up call to them that their behavior will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>There may be some truth to that, but it can only go so far, says O’Neill. “I think grudges can be healthy in the sense that they can represent an invitation to examine your feelings toward someone,” she says.</p>
<p>However, even if holding a grudge against someone can be enlightening and even empowering at times, dwelling in a place of anger and resentment doesn’t help you grow or live a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/what-is-happiness-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happier</a> life.</p>
<h2>How Do Grudges Affect Our Mental Health?</h2>
<p>Holding grudges can be just as damaging to the grudge-holder as the person who the grudge is being held against.</p>
<p>Holding a grudge means that you are living with a feeling of anger almost constantly, even if it’s below the surface. Sure, you may not be thinking about the grudge 24 hours a day, but this sort of resentment can find its way into all aspects of your life. It can be easy to start seeing everyone you meet as someone who has the potential to wrong you.</p>
<p>There are psychological conditions that can result from excessive grudge-holding, according to O’Neill. When you can end up “stuck” in a grudge, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a>, heightened <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/stress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stress</a>, or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depression</a> are common conditions that can manifest, she explains.</p>
<h2>What Are Some Ways To Let Grudges Go?</h2>
<p>Letting go of grudges doesn’t necessarily mean resolving a particular problem you have with a person. Obviously, having constructive conversations with someone who has upset you — and hopefully coming up with a resolution that feels good for both parties involved — is a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/03/how-setting-micro-goals-can-increase-happiness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goal</a>. But sometimes things will remain unresolved, and that hurt can linger.</p>
<p>In this case, rather than getting stuck with anger about what happened, we need to learn to take responsibility for our own feelings about the situation. Grudges can be seen as an opportunity to learn that “instead of being dependent on someone else to fix your feelings for you, you’re able to fulfill that need for yourself,” O’Neill says.</p>
<p>Perhaps then there is a positive to holding grudges.</p>
<p>If we can get past the feeling of resentment, maybe there is a real chance for self-growth. It’s an opportunity for us to to accept things for what they are, live more completely in the present, practice some serious self-love — and most of all, learn the fine art of letting go.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s typically easy to recognize “problematic” mental health — most of the time we know how to recognize <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depression</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/stress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stress</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/11/fighting-style-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conflict</a>&#8230;the list goes on. When we strive for good mental health, however, it’s a little harder to figure out exactly what that means.</p>
<p>What is good mental health, and how do we know when we’ve got it? Everything you need to know can be found below.<span id="more-11416"></span></p>
<h2>New Thinking About an Old Problem</h2>
<p>Even experts have trouble agreeing on what good mental health looks like, so a group of psychiatry researchers recently reviewed ideas from around the world, hoping for a more useful and standardized way to think about mental health.</p>
<p>The authors crafted a definition that fits well with what mental health professionals look for when working with clients. Unfortunately, their definition is not very clear to most people outside the clinical and professional worlds of psychology and psychology.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4471980/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">paper</a>, these authors proposed the following definition:</p>
<p><i>“Mental health is a dynamic state of internal equilibrium which enables individual to use their abilities in harmony with universal values of society. Basic cognitive and social skills; ability to recognize, express, and modulate one’s own emotions, as well as empathize with others; feasibility and ability to cope with adverse life events and function in social roles; and harmonious relationships between body and mind represent important components of mental health which contribute, to varying degrees, to the state of internal equilibrium.”</i></p>
<p>What a mouthful! What does this definition really mean?</p>
<h2>Good Mental Health Explained</h2>
<p>Fortunately, these authors broke down their definition in a way that helps us make sense of it. Using their explanations as a guideline, let’s look at what this definition tells us about good mental health.</p>
<h3>Dynamic equilibrium</h3>
<p>We can’t be happy all the time. In fact, being happy in the midst of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/category/loneliness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tragedy</a> could actually be a sign of poor mental health. How we <i>feel</i> is less important than whether the feelings objectively match the situation. In addition, our ability to recover from stressors matters.</p>
<p>In short, dynamic equilibrium is just a fancy way to say that our reactions fit the circumstances, but we bounce back when life throws curve balls (better known as “resilience”).</p>
<h3>Cognitive and social skills</h3>
<p>Good mental health depends on our ability to think, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/what-flaking-on-plans-says-about-your-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plan</a>, and act in socially effective ways. It’s possible to have some problems in this area but still function effectively.</p>
<p>Many people function well because they use their strengths to make up for their deficits. For example, someone with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/06/time-management-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADHD</a> might compensate by using organizers and timers, while someone who’s naturally shy might bring a friend along to a new social activity.</p>
<h3>Empathy</h3>
<p>Empathy allows you to understand someone else’s thoughts and feelings based on your own experiences. It helps us get along with other people.</p>
<p>A callous, uncaring person is likely to have chronic lack of empathy. On the other hand, being too empathic to stand up for yourself when necessary can lead to greater issues, such as anxiety or depression. Appropriate empathy keeps our relationships intact even as we meet our own needs.</p>
<h3>Flexibility and adaptability</h3>
<p>Good mental health requires us to accept life’s inevitable changes, then adjust our behaviors to function adequately. In other words, we roll with life’s punches.</p>
<p>It’s normal for bad things to upset us. Good mental health requires us to accept that change happens, then choose healthy behaviors to handle the new situation effectively.</p>
<h3>Mind/body connection</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/10/5-ways-improve-body-image-confidence-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poor diet</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/01/the-surprising-new-connection-between-sleep-and-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lack of sleep</a>, and inadequate physical activity affect our minds just as they do our bodies, because mind and body are one and the same. A mind can’t be healthy if its home is crumbling around it.</p>
<h2>Putting it All Together</h2>
<p>While older definitions of mental health focus heavily on <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/what-is-happiness-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happiness</a> or were limited to a single society’s values, the authors of the new study developed a broader definition. Their work offers a good explanation of what mental health professionals look for when we decide how to help our clients.</p>
<p>It’s normal to be unhappy sometimes, to worry sometimes, to get angry when someone wrongs you, or grieve when someone leaves. The most important things are:</p>
<ol>
<li>How well you function in all of your roles,</li>
<li>Whether you bounce back from challenges effectively, and</li>
<li>How you use your strengths to make up for deficits.</li>
</ol>
<p>No matter what your diagnosis or challenge, a therapist’s goal is to help you function at your best using the abilities you have. When you seek the same for yourself, positive changes naturally follow.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What defense mechanisms are holding you back?</p>
<p>Psychoanalytic theory holds that there are certain <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/11/how-dangerous-is-denial/">defense mechanisms</a> that people use in order to cope with life stressors. While it’s normal to have and employ defense mechanisms, they can, paradoxically, end up making your life a lot harder in the long run.<span id="more-11413"></span></p>
<p>Defense mechanisms can make us feel better about things in the short term, but read on if you want to explore which of them may be sabotaging your long term chances at <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/02/what-is-happiness-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happiness</a>.</p>
<h2>Common Defense Mechanisms, and How They Can Affect You</h2>
<p>There is a long list of defense mechanisms, but these are some of the most common, issue-prone examples that I see in my practice.</p>
<h3>Denial</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/11/how-dangerous-is-denial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Denial</a> is a classic defense mechanism, whereby you deny the existence of something that is too difficult or uncomfortable to deal with. This is used frequently by those struggling with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/addiction-mental-illness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">addiction</a>, or with many mental health issues.</p>
<p>You can recognize this if you’ve ever told yourself something like, “I’m not drinking too much, I barely had three drinks last night and they were watered down,” despite your friends remembering you had closer to 8 or 10.</p>
<p>It is obvious that denying a problem doesn’t make it go away, and makes it impossible to confront or resolve, which is why it’s essential to recognize if denial is your go-to defense mechanism.</p>
<h3>Projection</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/08/projecting-problems-onto-your-partner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Projection</a> is when someone feels so ashamed of acting a certain way, they instead act like someone else is exhibiting the behavior that they are guilty of.</p>
<p>For example, a wife who knows that she yells too much at her kids may accuse her husband of having anger management issues. While one part of her mind knows that she is the one with an <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/anger-emotions-run-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anger</a> problem, she is so ashamed of directly confronting this fact that her brain subconsciously projects her insecurity onto someone else; in this case, her husband.</p>
<h3>Displacement</h3>
<p>Displacement is when you use a replacement object as the recipient of feelings or behaviors, because you’re afraid to direct the energy toward the person you’re really thinking about.</p>
<p>For instance, a man angry at his boss for passing him over for a promotion may find it much too terrifying to think about confronting his boss. He may also may be ashamed to consider that he wasn’t promoted do to his <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/11/receiving-feedback-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">performance</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, his subconscious gives him a convenient out, and redirects his anger. He comes home at night and instantly tears into his son for being “lazy” and playing <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2018/11/is-video-gaming-addiction-real/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video games</a> all afternoon.</p>
<h3>Repression</h3>
<p>When feelings are too intense, uncomfortable, or taboo, then our subconscious hides them from our conscious mind.</p>
<p>For example, if a woman feels jealous of her sister’s <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/01/its-time-to-screen-all-pregnant-women-for-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pregnancy</a>, she may push this feeling out of consciousness and repress it entirely. Unfortunately though, when feelings are repressed, they don’t disappear as neatly as the person wishes they would.</p>
<p>In this case, the woman may end up avoiding her sister or lashing out at her, although she remains consciously unaware of why. As you can imagine, exploring what’s at the root of her behavior would likely help her to understand it and to be more supportive.</p>
<h2>Sound Familiar? A Professional Can Help.</h2>
<p>If you recognize these defense mechanisms in yourself — and you very well may since they are so common — then think deeply about the impact that they may have on your life.</p>
<p>Choosing not to deal with your subconscious feelings or your actual behaviors can significantly hold you back in life. Working with a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2016/11/therapist-psychotherapist-complete-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">therapist</a>, or doing your own introspection, can make you more aware of your defense mechanisms, allowing you to behave in a way that is more consistent with your goals and values.</p>
