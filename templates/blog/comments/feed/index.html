		<description><![CDATA[Hi John, (I&#039;m the author of this article btw)

It sounds like she might be following one of the steps in this guide (not saying she read it, most likely came to the decision on her own or received advice): staying off social media for a while after a breakup. It doesn&#039;t necessarily mean anything and I think you&#039;re only torturing yourself by thinking about it more than you need to. I&#039;m not blaming you, though. It&#039;s hard not to think about it, right? I hate to admit it, but my articles and advice can only go so far because I&#039;m not a licensed therapist like the people I work with. If you want more guidance than what my article can offer, I suggest signing up for Talkspace. You can email me at joseph.rauch@talkspace.com if you want to chat more or receive a coupon code. Many of our clients start therapy after breakups and feel much better afterwards. I hope that helps!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi my I&#039;m having this problem where my ex recently broke up with me about a week ago and I have this urge to see if she&#039;s okay or at least with someone else. But since the day she left me I haven&#039;t seen her post anything or get on any social media. And im starting to think maybe she moved on to someone else but might be hiding I&#039;m not sure I may be over thinking the situation. But does that mean anything since she hasn&#039;t contacted me or used any social media ? I&#039;m really losing my mind over her and I can&#039;t help checking to see if something is going on..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi shannon, 

I&#039;ve just read your article and i totally agree on most things. 

I&#039;m a 32 year old man from the Netherlands and my wife lives in thailand and is 12 years older.  Yes i know,  that&#039;s kind of unique. 

We are together since 2010 and got married in april of 2013.  We&#039;re still having a long distance marriage as of now and in September this year she will come visit me in the netherlands.  So that&#039;s awsome. 

We started our blog to show other people that it&#039;s really possible but the crucial part is to have an endgoal in mind.  We love to live in thailand together in the future.  But it takes some time. 

I&#039;d love to talk some with you about this subject.  So feel free to contact me anytime. 

Kind regards. 

Chris]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The media always wants to change things up and never in a good way.  I to have battled mental illness, my hole life. The key word there is battled. I have ups and down and sometimes I fall hard and feel very weak at the time but that&#039;s because i&#039;m going through a very hard battle. Saying its impossible to understand how someone who projects so much confidence and has managed to achieve so much so quickly, could ever struggle with mental health and insecurity is foolish at best. That&#039;s like saying a war vet is weak. No he or she has been through hell and back many times and I don&#039;t think that&#039;s the type of person you want to mess with. Thank you Ronda Rousey for giving all of those that don&#039;t comprehend our fully understand a new light on mental illness. God Bless.]]></description>
